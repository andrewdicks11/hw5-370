/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

Machine Learning Pipelines.  This assignment uses materials adapted from <a href="https://bbengfort.github.io/tutorials/2016/05/19/text-classification-nltk-sckit-learn.html">Benjamin Bengfort</a>.</p>
<p>We are going back to work that you did in previous courses with object-oriented Python to create a proprocessor
to do NLP on some text in the context of machine learning pipelines.</p>
<p>First, we are going to review code that you should find reusable and helpful moving forward.  There's a lot of setup 
for this homework assignment.</p>

<h2 id="Your-challenge:">Your challenge:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Your-challenge:">&#182;</a></h2><p>Build a sentiment classifier for the IMDB Dataset, which is available in the data/ directory.  Please note that
the IMDB Dataset consists of 50000 rows, so it's probably best to do most of your work on a sample of the
original dataset.  In the code below we use a sample size of 1000.  That's probably fine to start with but your final submission should be based on a sample of at least 5000.</p>
<p>You should attempt to improve the default classifier shown above by trying to get a higher accuracy score.  For example, you might want to try one of the other classifiers from the list shown in class 22.  Another way to improve your pipeline is to spend more time
building a better text preprocessor (e.g. you can see some reviews contain HTML, which you might decide to strip out).  Another thing you might want to do is to look more closely at the stopword list.</p>
<p>Please note that if you resample the dataset you will get slightly different accuracy values.  The values should not fluctuate wildly, so don't get too concerned about their absolute value.  What we're looking for is an improvement from the baseline and evidence that you tried a variety of approaches to improving the classifier.  We're also looking for evidence that you can manipulate text data into a machine learning pipeline and correctly interpret the results.</p>
<p>You should include code and interpretation of your results in this notebook.   If you tried many different approaches and ultimately chose one over the others, please include that in your write-up.  You do not need to include code for analyses that you discarded.</p>
<p>You should be able to plug the new data into the old pipeline code to get started (another handy thing about pipelines) and then start experimenting with improving the code!</p>

<pre>Also known as &#34;Water Lilies&#34; this film tells the story of two girls as they struggle their way into the world of love and sex. This story is told at a slow pace and that works very well. It gives plenty of time and space to get to know the different characters and to grow somewhat attached to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a small cast puts some extra pressure on the people playing as they all have some more screen time than normal but the people playing in this film handle that well. Everyone is completely believable. Visual setting is great, especially the underwater shots in the swimming pool add a nice effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many films have been made about the same subject though and this one does not really stand out above any of them. It pulls some &#34;standard&#34; pressure methods out of the high hat and works on them. It isn&#39;t bad, not at all, but it surely isn&#39;t great either and I do feel it could have done better if it had taken some what less explored angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers

I smiled through the whole film. The music is great. The story-telling is great. It&#39;s a wonderful film. This picture is made with respect and a true love of the sixties.

My, how the mighty have fallen. Kim Basinger is a great actress but she was definitely slumming when she took this role. This movie is bad for one reason in particular: lapses in logic. Its looks like one of those movies that would have been passable with all its plot holes if it had came out in the 80s and 90s but in 2008 it just looks real stupid. This is the worst thriller I&#39;ve ever seen and I&#39;ve seen The Bone Collector and Twisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story details Della(Kim Basinger)is just getting from buying gifts in a mall an is harassed by a gang of thugs that end up killing a cop that came to her aid. From then on she is chased by these idiotic goons through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many things are wrong with this movie. As I said this movie leaps over logic at every turn and with the exception of Kim Basinger, the acting is made-for-TV bad. Hell, this pseudo thriller is made-for-TV bad. The way she kills each of these politically correct thugs(1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 1 African American all coming together to stalk a Caucasian woman. Don&#39;t you just love America?)is laughable to a fault. The way she killed the Hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the main hoodlum was so out in left field that it make you shake your head in shame. I only recommend this to lovers of bad films and no one else. Anybody else especially Kim Basinger fans would do well not to own this flick. You don&#39;t want see an actress you respect in a film this bad now do you? Of course not. You were warned.

Two years after its initial release, Goldeneye still sits atop the field of first-person shooters for the Nintendo 64. Even the Quake and Turok series have not had the combination of graphic detail, sound quality, enemy intelligence, challenge and overall fun that bring me back to this game over and over again. The missions each have specific objectives that force you to think as Bond, not just to shoot up every baddie that pops up on your screen, but also to avoid cameras, disable security systems, rescue hostages, protect the Bond girl, and so on. Q gadgets abound in this game, including the famous watch. The game is loosely based on the movie storyline, including all the major characters and the best scenes of the movie, from the dam bungee-jump to the prop-plane escape to the tank chase through St. Petersburg. Even the layout is preserved where possible, so you&#39;ll recognize various situations if you&#39;ve seen the film. Other levels are added to challenge the player and string together the scenes a little more. With each difficulty level the mission objectives are more difficult, the enemies smarter and the bullets more lethal. I still have not gotten through the 00-Agent levels. Cheats can be opened, not by entering codes or pushing buttons, but by completing certain levels within a certain time frame, and additional characters can be opened up for the multiplayer. The multiplayer is still the best among the first-person shooters. It&#39;s not as crisp as Turok but it doesn&#39;t slow down nearly as much... tons of options give your friends reason to blow each other up over and over again, and one more time just for kicks. There are better games for the N64, such as Zelda and all things Star Wars, but Rare has continued their streak of outstanding games with a first-person shooter that has not and will not be surpassed until they top themselves in 2000 with Perfect Dark.

This movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment and learned that appearance is everything. She and her son, who just recently returned from Vietnam collide in some very tense issues. The relationship has no connections intimately and is a great accurate portrayal of what it is like to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of issues. Kathy Bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either oblivious to her cruelty, forgetful or just doesn&#39;t want to be confronted. Jeremy&#39;s wrath is never feared and it leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his fathers love for him. This is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event leads one to despair.

I really liked this movie. Of course the idea is pretty much out there...the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small-time thief to lure a more dangerous thief/computer hacker out of hiding. But Alvin Sanders, the man who the feds have &#34;volunteered&#34; to be implanted with the device, is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while. Alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good-humored but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem. Definetly worth a watch.

I just finished watching &#34;El Otro&#34;. I have always taken my hat off to Julio Chavez&#39;s performances, as he is a great actor, but this movie is really depressing and slow. I guess that it would have been even worse if it wasn&#39;t for Julio. Anyways, this is definitely a film that you will never understand if you are not from Argentina, and even if you are, I would advise you not to rent this movie in order to have a nice time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends... it is really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot does not make a lot of sense neither. Probably the director wanted to show the fragility of the human life, but what he does is bore and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little bit. It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. Overall, I definitely didn&#39;t like this movie.

I got hold of a discount copy of this. I had seen it several years ago. My only recent experience had been &#34;Mystery Science Theatre&#34; where it was soundly spoofed. One never really gets a chance to get into these movies because of all the byplay. I love the beginnings of fifties horror movies. They give us a pompous lecture on the defense systems near the Arctic. These were there to protect us from the expected Soviet invasion, but they should come in handy, given the threat of very large insects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular one flies. For some reason, despite its exoskeleton made of the stuff grasshoppers are made of, they can still fend off air to air missiles and disable fighter planes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#39;s more fun--first, the obligatory deranged case who saw the flying thing, cooling his heels in a hospital (it just teaches one--see an insect as big as a house--keep your mouth shut). I wonder if the poor guy got to go home after they found the bug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is a pretty ordinary effort. It follows the usual efforts to come up with a way of dissuading the stubborn bug--and leaves us open to other possibilities--the Russians next time. I still get a kick out of these films and this one is serviceable.

In the 1930s, Hal Roach Studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase and the Little Rascals. Most of these films are exceptional and have withstood the passing of time. However, a lesser-known Roach product was the pairing of Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts (later, Todd was paired with the equally untalented Patsy Kelly). Try as I might, I just can&#39;t stand these pictures--they just aren&#39;t funny. Plus, unlike Laurel and Hardy, there was not an ounce of chemistry between Todd and her two co-stars. Before you just think I am a crank, understand that I have seen and reviewed several hundred Roach films as well as many other early comedies, so I am well acquainted with the genre and within the genre, this team is among the worst. Part of the reason I think I am right about the team is that as a lower-tier team at Roach, they were given all the scripts no one else wanted. If Stan or Ollie hated a given plot idea, it was often given to Todd and Pitts/Kelly--and usually it showed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this film, however, the team is at their absolute lowest. It&#39;s hard to imagine a comedy with less laughs and a more contrived plot. The film begins with Zasu in the jury and Thelma as a defense lawyer. As for Zasu, she&#39;s a completely annoying moron. NOT the lovable type moron (like Stan Laurel or Lou Costello), but just a totally annoying and grating person who is pushy and obnoxious. As for Thelma, as usual, she&#39;s the rather bland &#34;straight man&#34; and as such has little to do but react to Zasu&#39;s boorish behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot involves Thelma defending a client who is accused of selling exploding diet pills. Considering that the pills are highly dangerous, when the attorney asks Zasu to try swallowing one it just seems dumb. And, while they were called &#34;pills&#34;, they were more like giant black blobs that were larger than golf balls. Swallowing them only seemed contrived and made no sense--even for a low-brow comedy. When they find she has swallowed the pill and it really is explosive, everyone panics and runs about like idiots until the film ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I am not a fan of this team. However, even for those who want to like the film, there isn&#39;t one legitimate laugh in the entire short! When I talked over this review with my wife (who also saw the movie with me), she thought my score of 2 was overly generous!!

This movie is one of those &#34;WOW!&#34; movies. Not because it&#39;s the greatest movie of all time, but because it surprised me. Not only was it a T.V. movie, but it was on Elvis. I can safely say as many impersonators as there are there was only one Elvis, but I can also safely say that Kurt Russel came extremely close to being the real thing. It was one of the greatest impersonations that I have ever seen. He had me believing that it was really him. I learned a lot about Elvis&#39; life from watching this movie. And don&#39;t led the television part of it let you stray-it&#39;s actually a really fantastic film! And Kurt Russel could&#39;ve been Elvis&#39; twin :)

When I first read Armistead Maupins story I was taken in by the human drama displayed by Gabriel No one and those he cares about and loves. That being said, we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of Hollywood...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have truly succeeded! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just the right amount of restraint Robin Williams captures the fragile essence of Gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life(Jess) and the world around him(Donna).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. The request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps Gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s to bad that most people will avoid this film. I only say that because the average American will probably think &#34;Robin Williams in a serious role? That didn&#39;t work before!&#34; PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE! Robin Williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people. Like his movie One Hour Photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and before I forget, I believe Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals every scene he is in. He has the 1940&#39;s leading man looks and screen presence. It&#39;s this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S~

Where&#39;s Michael Caine when you need him? I&#39;ve seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this rare pre-1st season flick (episdoe K-20) is easily one of the worst movies ever made. Three &#34;stars&#34;, Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever, delivering lines which must have been written by a secret Dick Cheney-style workgroup composed of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research. Looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness, possibly on Super 8. Makes Logan&#39;s Run look like the cinematic Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare. I can&#39;t imagine watching it without the commentary of Crow and Servo since it&#39;s unwatchable even with it. Clearly what&#39;s needed in Hollywood is some sort of 401K which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care. With its &#34;rights to pollute and drive&#34; theme, by the end, I&#39;m half expecting to see a Charlton Heston cameo where he delivers his &#34;cold dead hands&#34; speech. Lee, I could have forgiven you for this in 1989, but 1981?

So it&#39;s not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? &#34;The Villain&#34; and this one could top the list.My husband says that &#34;Jekyll and Hyde Together Again&#34; is one of those movies that if &#34;you&#39;ve been there and done that&#34; you&#39;ll think this spoof on the 80&#39;s cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate. To say that the film doesn&#39;t follow the book would be true, but then a lot of really good films take liberties with the published word also. I recommend this movie to all the old &#34;stoners&#34; among us. We may be smarter now, but we will still recognize and laugh at many folks we knew (ourselves?) back in the old days.

A wonderful, free flowing, often lyrical film that whisks you along, ever smiling, even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way. One gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well. This is possibly Depardieu&#39;s best performance, certainly his most natural. Jeanne Moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age. Miou-Miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play. Initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rant/romp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges. In the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect.

I just don&#39;t see how a Concorde-New Horizons film directed by Jim Wynorski and featuring the acting talents of Andrew Stevens and a puppet could be bad. It just boggles the mind, doesn&#39;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, let&#39;s make no mistake about it. &#34;Munchie Strikes Back&#34; is indeed a bad film. Munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries. For reasons not fully explained until the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son. The mom&#39;s problem (her main problem at least) is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks...to the not-so-tiny tune of $20,000. Ouch. She can&#39;t come up with the money because she just got fired. OK...JUST is the key word in that sentence. What the...? Was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck? Maybe it would&#39;ve been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it...ya think?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess...but there isn&#39;t a limit on the number of wishes you can make! Munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall Munchie was &#34;borrowing&#34; it from. The annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating. A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the Earth several times. Sadly, those dumb parents watching the game don&#39;t think it&#39;s at all strange. Hmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#39;d like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is. You&#39;ll be truly moved by the scene where Leslie-Anne Down, playing the mother, kicks a dog which is yapping at her. Your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer. &#34;Munchie Strikes Back&#34;&#39;s credits promised another film to follow entitled, I believe, &#34;Munchie Hangs Ten&#34;. To date, the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force. Heh. 1/10

wow! this is a good movie! The acting wasn&#39;t good at all, but if you look at some moments in the film, rewind, and watch it again, it is genius! The man in the begin of the film walks with his suitcase against a three. WOW!I never expected that. Then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away. I bet that smoking guy against that three was one of his mates who sold the drugs later. And the genius quotes: &#39;&#39;nice shades, i need a pair&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;their yours.. if you think you can take them..&#39;&#39;.. just Brilliant! And the fighting is the best i&#39;ve seen in a while. Look at the second guy he takes down after he hit the head of the first guy against the table. WHAT A HIT! And in the middle of the film, one guy in a car shot one time, then 3 guys fall, he is really good at aiming. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The end was brilliant, it was so exciting that james cahill walks 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoot jason peters after his distraction moves. Jason Peters falls down, and roll over again while he is dead! I can&#39;t say with more words how great this movie is!

Having read the reviews for this film, I understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good. However, this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time. The majority of reviews that i had read, said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow. And whilst some parts do leave you confused, the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you&#39;ve missed so much. It&#39;s not like &#34;Lock, Stock...&#34; or &#34;Snatch&#34;, in the sense that it isn&#39;t that funny (in fact, it&#39;s pretty dark), and it is a lot more intelligent, in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints (and, in one of the best scenes of the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself). The way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned, is that it is full of memorable characters, specifically Statham, who gives a fantastic performance as the lead, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the film in Speedos, but gives a great performance none the less. If you&#39;ve got time, and have time afterwards to think about the film, and even watch it again, you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film. I think it&#39;s fantastic, and that Guy Ritchie is a director on top of his game.

I&#39;m currently slogging through Gibbon&#39;s &#39;Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire , so I&#39;ve had all things Roman on my mind. I&#39;m not very far into it yet, maybe two hundred plus pages, but it is amazing just how many of these Roman emperors were killed. I believe I&#39;ve read through maybe 15 emperors so far and only Antonius, Trajan, and Hadrian haven&#39;t been killed or at least suspected of having been killed. I have also been fascinated by the mad excesses of many of these princes of Rome. Not the least practitioner of these was Caligula. This brings me to reviewing this film. I&#39;m thinking of the film on a historical basis as far as I understand it from Gibbon&#39;s explanation of Rome,as well as other research from some good web sites and some fiction novels dealings with the period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is I do not think that this film is what it is thought to be by many of it&#39;s proponents. I do not think the depravity shown with the sex and horrendous violence of this film qualify it as accurate. The general ideas of the film seem accurate. Caligula is raised on an island ,exiled with his family and in content fear of being murdered by the increasingly mad, suspicious and strange emperor Tiberius. He grows up paranoid and afraid and can never shake the cutesy nickname given him by his guards, Little Boots, this helps him grow up feeling abused and powerless. He is handed the empire after Tiberius dies, the senate hoping he will steer away from the informer squads which brought death by whim of the former delusionally paranoid tyrant, and lead Rome away from the madness that dictator had settled it into. Caligula begins as a decent if hands-off emperor, but gets sick, almost dies, and comes back from the brink of feverous death a true monster. His perversities with his sisters do begin here, if not before. He does have Macro killed and many others who were his originally supporters. The acts of madness seemed not to be the murders of Caligula as much as his new thinking of himself as a living God. Him seen talking to the statue of Jupiter as an equal doomed him. His violent mad excesses would have doomed him anyway, and three years seems to have been quite a decent run for the successors of Tiberius. Well the film basically sticks to these lines while it manages to be coherent, which is not common through it&#39;s entirety, it does so while trying to shock the audience at all turns, in every single scene the film begs you to be disgusted by the depravity of ancient Rome. The shocking scenes are what this film is built entirely upon and where it entirely fails. It is just too much to see successive rulers have man after man murdered, raped, tortured for no reason but fancy. The depictions of the violence are possibly, but not probably, accurate. Murder certainly was the order of the day in Imperial Rome, torture beforehand was rote. But the director&#39;s visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists, while the bystanders watch with nonchalance, I just don&#39;t see it having gone down exactly like that. The death machine, the beheader, is certainly something like you&#39;ve never seen in movies, and something once seen you shall probably never forget, even as I, you wish you could. The wine drinking while the penis is roped off is the same, once you&#39;ve seen this shame it is yours forever. These things strike me the director&#39;s and that porn magnate&#39;s fantasies. They sprung from their sick imaginations and not from any proved record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is pretty good. I actually think Mcdowell is the weakest link here. Mirren is always something to behold, and here in her youthful years she is formidable and beautiful. The portrayals of Nerva and Tiberius are done very well by their respected actors. The film could have done so much better story telling, it is such a failure that way its just a whole other layer of what a shame this thing was. For example it could have given opinion on how and why Caligula went mad, or shown that he was mad, paranoid before his illness and that fever then broke the mental restraint he had possessed previously. It could have shown the weakness of Claudius and the miracle it was he survived Caligula. It could have these and many other things but it stuck to it&#39;s sad nightmares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally about the sex. It is porn. It shows these sex acts being done all over the palaces by many people. Male on male, female on female, male on female. It is passionless, disgusting sex. Sex that if your point is to get off on it, I seriously doubt you could. Both Tiberius and Caligula may have been sex addicts, and orgies may have been common enough but the visions in this film seem to recall more a Greek time than a Roman. I don&#39;t think that kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies right out in the open were common until the the strange, depraved reign of Elgabalus, and he was killed for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film should probably never be watched, if your curious about it , let it go. It is something, as I said earlier, if you do watch this you will unfortunately retain it&#39;s sick visions in your minds eye for years to come. I don&#39;t think its an accurate historical picture in particular, even if it is historical in whole.

Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton- what more could you ask for? Monkey Grip based on the prize winning novel of the same name explores Nora (Hazlehurst, a single mother falling for a heroin addict Jobe (Friels). A simple story is made truly extraordinary through the all round magnificent acting (in particular Noni Hazlehurst) and nice use of the small budget. The only flaw is (if you can pick it up) is that the story is set in Melbourne, although for budget reasons, the film was mainly shot in Sydney, so as a result, in a few scenes you see trams (Melbourne scenes) and then a Carlton post office (Sydney scenes). Other than that, &#34;Monkey Grip&#34; is a must see (excuse the clique, but it is) at least for an award winning performance from former &#34;Play School&#34; and &#34;Better Homes &amp; Gardens&#34; presenter Noni Hazlehurst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10

his has to surely be one of the worst gay-themed films of all time. Who told any of the so-called actors that they can act. Bad sound - bad script - gestures so overboard that they defy reality. A nightclub scene with only one actor and dubbed crowd scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing other low budget films similarly made I was prepared for something innovative - but not plain pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to make such tripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the DVD - No menu access; its worse than a VHS tape. Once you start you have to watch the whole thing through - luckily the fast forward button works - with this film and DVD nothing else does.

Deformed, aged female scientist kills fellow scientist in order to steal formulae for rejuvenating cells and reversing the aging process. She takes it and turns into the beautiful, evil Satanik (Magda Konopka) who goes around, seducing and murdering wealthy businessmen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She dresses very stylishly in late-60s mod clothes and manipulates those around her, looking a lot like the late Marisa Mell from the DIABOLIK film. Coincidence??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in spite of all this, it&#39;s amateurish and sloppy without the James Bond pop-art gadgetry that DIABOLIK had had. Even the Madrid and Lake Geneva filming locations don&#39;t make up for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soundtrack is by Manuel Parada &amp; Roberto Pregadio and it isn&#39;t bad at all, consisting of lush orchestration with a little fuzz guitar used as an embellishment. Perfect for one of those European Loungecore CDs that came out in the 90s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Retromedia DVD also uses a substandard grainy color print that&#39;s in poor shape, with an explanation at the beginning saying that this was due to the age of the film. Bull ! They either didn&#39;t bother looking for a better source or they couldn&#39;t find one at all. There are only a few stills of Magda and that&#39;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sloppy &amp; poor all around, this one gets a 3 out of 10.

There are so many things wrong with this movie I don&#39;t even know where to begin. The story is not cohesive AT ALL. I guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching his/her head in confusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s what I remember of the movie before I was bored into unconsciousness: A quasi-abusive dad chases some pre-teen sisters through a house but turns out to be not that abusive after all. In the next scene, the girls are about 15. They&#39;re driving with their parents and hit a deer. The deer must have been explosive because their car blows up, one sister drags the other from the burning wreckage. Then, the girls are drifting in a boat on a lake and make a huge plan to go to Kentucky (??) and start a new life. In the very next scene, the girls are hitchhiking toward a military base. And what a military base it is. Actually, it&#39;s more like a hog farm converted to look like a military base with plenty of confused extras playing &#34;soldiers.&#34; The base commander&#39;s office is particularly awesome because there are random things like an AK-47 hanging on the wall and a drill sergeant hat mounted to a plaque (????) so the audience is sure to know that this is a military guy&#39;s office. Then some random dude pushing a motorcycle shows up and the base commander orders him to go &#34;into town&#34; to buy some porn mags, and to make sure the soldiers don&#39;t think that he&#39;s on the &#34;pink team.&#34; So our character takes a pickup converted to look like an army truck &#34;to town&#34; and loads up a box from a nondescript &#34;book store&#34; with a blowup doll by the front door. The girls hide in the guy&#39;s truck when he stops to gas up, and look through the porn stash to find items inside like the &#34;anal invader.&#34; I guess that&#39;s enough of the plot to scare most people away. Plot aside, the sound quality is terrible and the movie is full of cheesy attempts at symbolism, like a radio preacher talking about forbidden fruit during the scene where the &#34;slutty&#34; sister meets the main character for the first time, or how the camera lingers way too long on certain shots to try to convey a &#34;message&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever see this for sale or rent or whatever, stay away. It&#39;s not worth the money in either case.

This is such a crappy movie I have no idea how it got on the shelves, they must have paid the movie store to make them put it there, seriously! The story makes absolutely no sense unless you are on some seriously heavy drugs, you would definitely have to be on something in order to watch this total piece of garbage, so much so that you would not care what was on the TV because you&#39;re almost in a coma. The writing sounds like it was done by a 5-year-old and the acting is worse than grade school plays. The hideous special effects they were trying to do look so stupid, what did they spend a whole $5 to make the entire movie, it looks like it! Oh my, that scene with the old woman who has an 80&#39;s hairdo and the ugly girls in the rubber suits, me and my friends laughed so hard. Did someone actually think it was a good idea to make this into a movie? I find that hard to believe!

The danish movie &#34;Slim Slam Slum&#34; surprised me to be the worst movie i have seen to this date. I didn&#39;t think that it was possible to top my list of bad bad b-movies but this one deserves the gold. It&#39;s not funny. It&#39;s bad acting, It&#39;s bad filmed and the storyline is bad. The only positive thing i can say about this movie is it has three girls in it. I truly believe this flick has the potential to knock of the other danish movie &#34;Stjerner uden hjerner&#34; as the badest danish film ever made! And that&#39;s truly something. Congratulations in advance!

So first things first..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angels and Demons is a much better and very different film than the Da- Vinci code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the recent slew of comic book movies, remakes and questionable resurrections of aged franchises. it is refreshing to watch a very solid and entertaining film that is devoid of shaky cam filming techniques, lens flare, excessive GCI and over the top action sequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this respect Angels and Demons almost feels old fashioned.It offers a good and considered debate on the age old subject of religion Vs science, offers an insight in to the parallels between the grand houses of God in Rome (beautifully shot by the way) and the temple of modern science that is CERN&#39;s large hadron collider facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanks is Hanks pretending to be the smart guy and he fits the role much better second time around than his wooden performance in Da-Vinci. good support is offered by a rock solid cast, with a particular highlight being Armin Mueller-Stahl&#39;s stoic Cardinal. but the films main saving grace is it&#39;s pace. for the entire running time I was totally engrossed in the story and the film never really gave me time to sit and pick apart its faults in logic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only serious criticism is that some of the science depicted is at best debatable regards real world authenticity. But that is not the fault of the film makers, rather an observation of the old adage that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of which the story is a cracker, mixing adventure and a race against time with a good sprinkling of intelligence and a nice twist or two along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall I would highly recommend this to fans of either of the national treasure movies (which this clearly mimics but with a much more serious vibe) and fans of ripping adventure tales in general.

Soon after watching this film you will realize why it didn&#39;t even make it to the theaters! This movie does not deserve the &#34;prequel&#34; tag. Instead this is a common theme in Hollywood, rip off previously good movies with disastrous prequels, sequels, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film&#39;s plot was bouncing all over the place like a ping pong ball, and the character development was non-existent. I seriously felt like I was watching a comedy at some points in the movie because the acting was so bad. P Diddy needs to stop tainting movies with his horrible acting, he actually made me laugh every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing that comes out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks excellent in this movie and actually brought some enjoyment from watching this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a big Carlito&#39;s Way fan, I recommend you not watch this. If you decide to watch it anyway then treat this movie as if it ripped off the original, because that is exactly what it did.

I must say I was surprised to find several positive comments to this turkey (in desperate need of a feather transplant)! I&#39;m giving it a 1 because I think the idea of making a movie about the wild man of rock&#39;n&#39;roll - Jerry Lee Lewis, is honorable, but it&#39;s a shame to put out such trash and the &#34;killer&#34; does not deserve this! It&#39;s a good thing it came late in his career... they said Elvis practically ruined his career with the movies he put out through the sixties and this could have done the same for Jerry lee, had it come out some 15-20 years earlier! It&#39;s based on Myra Gail Lewis book and that&#39;s a shame to begin with. It&#39;s a bad and inaccurate story of her life together with Lewis and there is far better books about the Killer, that could have made a much better and more interesting script. Add to this a bunch of actors who doesn&#39;t know if they are participating in a drama, comedy or a little bit of both! The otherwise fine actor Dennis Quaid is putting on what must be one of the worst performances of an actor in many a moon! He is walking around in the picture, talking about his &#34;god-given talent&#34; and as a spectator, you wish he&#39;d show some of it on the screen too! Silly gestures and funny faces and Jerry Lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what had become of him in this truly awful movie! The rest of the crew is almost as bad... save for Winona Ryder, who does her best with the crappy lines given to her. It&#39;s &#34;Grease&#34; all over again and whenever Jerry Lee take a ride around Memphis in his convertible, having the radio on in the car, the whole town is dancing to the music from it! Everybody in this movie are like cartoon figures of the real people involved... from the wild man himself to Sun Records Sam Philips! And it&#39;s a damn shame! A charismatic and interesting artist like Jerry Lee Lewis deserves better and I hope he took the 500.000 dollars he got from the deal and told the company to go f**k themselves... twice!

What can be said, really... &#34;The Tenant&#34; is a first-class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full-blown paranoia. It&#39;s an intricately-plotted film--every detail seems included for a reason--even though the plot seldom makes sense, and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner. Therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable Trelkovsky (Polanski)--a meek Polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenant&#39;s suicide--to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty. After an apartment-warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers, Trelkovsky comes under increased, seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building; the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfu*k on par with the later efforts of David Lynch. &#34;The Tenant,&#34; however, is more brooding and sinister, laced with unexpected comic relief, fine performances, and a truly haunting score. It&#39;s a movie that&#39;s better experienced than described, so hop to it.

who reads these comments may think we may have in hand a great movie. I am Portuguese and I&#39;m ashamed that this film became a blockbuster in Portugal. It can&#39;t really call this cinema. The direction and &#34;mise-en-scene&#34; is basic (even Ron Howard does better!); the script is bad and pretentious (a really bad Tarantino); the cast is covered in TV stars, models and reality show stars that don&#39;t no nothing about acting. When you put in a movie this ingredients of course that the fans of this kind of TV shows will all go see. i am also surprised that people who make comments here in IMDb say that this movie is a masterpiece. I thought that this site was only for people who truly like cinema and understand a little bit of it. All the movies made to be blockbusters in Portgal always use the same ingredients and are always awful. if you think this movie is reasonable, please don&#39;t say your love movies and cinema.

I had never read any of Sarah Waters&#39; novels, or watched Tipping the Velvet. I only heard about Fingersmith when i was flipping through &#34;The L word&#34; websites. The storyline of Fingersmith interested me, yet i passed it away, thinking &#34;Lesbian in Victorian period, that never ends well, i have enough of those lesbo series and movies that go no where&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, during Christmas my local DVD store gave Fingersmith a discount, i brought the DVD, and my life has never been more colourful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mini series deserves to be cherished and praised. The acting is so great that i call it rare. Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy, Rupert Evans, Imelda Staunton, and many more that i can&#39;t name all, brought light and darkness to their characters. Just by a little gesture, a little look, a little touch, they made their characters real and as a viewer, i couldn&#39;t help it but take them home, keep them close. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fingersmith, sets in Victorian area, is a story of Sue-a thief who loves and lives with her &#34;Family&#34; of pick-pockets. Little did she know that her fate is linked to Maud Lily-a somewhat shy, timid girl grows up in a Mansion miles and miles away. Maud&#39;s mother left her a fortune, but Maud herself can&#39;t touch it, unless she married. Worst of all, Maud&#39;s uncle makes sure she never will by keeping her prisoned in the house. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Mr Gentlement, a charming, good-looking thief with a heart as bad as any. He wants Maud&#39;s fortune for himself, and in order to do so he sets Sue up as Maud Lily&#39;s maid, asking Sue to Persuade Maud to elope with him. as time goes by, Things would be simple, if Sue didn&#39;t fall in love with Maud. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And things would be simple, if the story was what i have just told. I do not wish to spoil, so i would like to stop there. But i can asure you that everything is twisted and turned before you can even aware of what has happened. Once it happened, you then question what would happen next. On top of that, the story is filled with passion unlike any others. There are no self-searching, sexuality questioning, &#34;Oh my god do i like girls&#34; moments, because the girls in Fingersmith are buried so deep in their own darkness that they barely be able to care. the story with such twisted plot moves as smooth as water, running passionately, but strangely calm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weeks have passed since i watched &#34;Fingersmith&#34;, yet Maud&#39;s eyes still haunt me, and Sue&#39;s words still warm my heart &#34;You pearl, you pearl, you pearl&#34;, she said. And such pearl it is.

The combination of amazing special effects and oscar worthy acting makes the Vindicator one of the most important sci-fi films of recent years. For some reason still unknown to me this gem was found in a bargain bin, why some worthless human thought it right to dirty a modern classic by relagating to a bargain bin is beyond me. I have never been so terrified by a man in tin foil and random bursts of fire. Forget Terminator, Robocop, Aliens, and other films that blaintly ripped off this masterpiece, the vindicator is an unstoppable force.

If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie, this won&#39;t be one for you. If the Truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. From a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in South Africa (and many other places).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as &#34;The Pianist,&#34; &#34;Schindler&#39;s List&#34; or &#34;Nuremberg.&#34; Millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. This movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper.

A CRY IN THE DARK &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A CRY IN THE DARK was a film that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid, if unremarkable film. This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streep&#39;s Best Actress nomination, the movie received little attention from major awards groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little did I anticipate that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a riveting drama, well-constructed on every level. If you ask me, this is an under-appreciatted classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film opens rather slowly, letting the audience settle into the Chamberlain&#39;s at a relaxed pace and really notice that, at the core, they are an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (the director) selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy, while also showing the attentive bliss with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain care for their children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the famous line &#34;A Dingo Took My Baby!&#34; has become somewhat of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to laughable. The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured. It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the Chamberlain&#39;s continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court, which suspects Lindy of murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping. As an audience member, I was fully invested in the Chamberlain&#39;s plight... and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media. But at the same, the media/public opinion is understandable. I loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic, but they always had valid reasons to hold their views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of performances, the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill... and they deliver in every way. For me, this ranks as one of (if not #1) Meryl Streep&#39;s best performances. For all her mastery of different accents (which of course are very impressive in their own right), Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters. I find this to be one of Streep&#39;s more subtle performances, and she hits it out of the park. And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep&#39;s performance. From what I&#39;ve seen, this is undoubtedly Neill&#39;s finest work to date. It&#39;s a shame he wasn&#39;t recognized by the Academy with a Leading Actor nomination to match Streep&#39;s... b/c the two of them play of each other brilliantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More emotionally gripping than most films, and also incredibly suspenseful... A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where Meryl screams &#34;The dingo took my baby!&#34; watch the film and see just how much more there is to A CRY IN THE DARK then that one line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... A ...

Wow I loved this movie! It is about normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Great! It is about things everybody encounters in life. You have to do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. There are people who find the opinion of others and &#39;what will the neighbors think&#39; more important than to follow their heart. Don&#39;t let anybody&#39;s opinion stop you from fulfilling your dreams and passion. I loved the fact that the actors were all really normal people, it could have been my family. No big beauties, but all people you fall in love with during the movie.

Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clichés about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I&#39;m sure the book was bad, but it can&#39;t have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow &#34;Tuscan&#34; lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn&#39;t Tuscan enough?), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. You&#39;ve never seen the white marble of Rome&#39;s Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, and therefore quite worth a look.

Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Professor Noodle (Lucien Littlefield) is nearing the completion of his rejuvenation formula, with the ability to reverse ageing, after twenty years. Ollie and Stan are the chimney sweeps that arrive to do their job, and very quickly Ollie wants to get away from Stan making mistakes. Ollie goes to the roof to help with the other end of the brush at the top of the chimney, but Stan in the living room ends up pushing the him back in the attic. After breaking an extension, Stan gets a replacement, a loaded gun, from off the wall, and of course it fires the brush off. Stan goes up to have a look, and Ollie, standing on the attic door of the roof, falls into the greenhouse. Stan asks if he was hurt, and Ollie only answers with &#34;I have nothing to say.&#34; Ollie gets back on the roof, and he and Stan end up in a tug and pull squabble which ends up in Ollie falling down and destroying the chimney. Ollie, hatless, in the fireplace is hit on the head by many bricks coming down, and the butler Jessup (Sam Adams) is covered in chimney ash smoke, oh, and Ollie still has nothing to say to Stan. The boys decide to clean up the mess, and when Stan tears the carpet with the shovel, Ollie asks &#34;Can&#39;t you do anything right&#34;, and Stan replies &#34;I have nothing to say&#34;, getting the shovel bashed on his head. As Ollie holds a bag for Stan to shovel in the ashes, they get distracted by a painting on the wall, and the ashes end up down Ollie&#39;s trousers, so Stan gets another shovel bashed on the head. Professor Noodle finishes his formula, and does a final test on a duck, with a drop in a tank of water, changing it into a duckling. He also shows the boys his success, turning the duckling into an egg, and he next proposes to use a human subject, i.e. his butler. While he&#39;s gone, the boys decide to test the formula for themselves, but Ollie ends up being knocked by Stan into the water tank with all the formula. In the end, what was once Ollie comes out, an ape, and when Stan asks him to speak, all Ollie ape says is &#34;I have nothing to say&#34;, and Stan whimpers. Filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film, it is an enjoyable film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians&#39; Comedian. Very good!

There is more to this movie than meets the eye. If you&#39;re looking for groundbreaking originality or easy comedy, you&#39;ll be disappointed. But for an entertaining 90 minutes, this is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography is careful and precise. The sex scenes, which one comment decries as gratuitous, are anything but - every gesture contributes to the development of the characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, some of the main characters are not exactly lovable human beings. But the movie makes an honest effort at showing their interactions in an honest light, without being sensationalistic (at least not for early 21st century urban standards). And there are many very amusing moments.

The best British Comedy Film ever! For years English comedy television programs have turned into films and have flopped, &#39;Are You Being Served?&#39; &#39;Dads Army&#39;, the list goes on. However the popular dark humoured BBC television show; &#39;The League of Gentlemen&#39; has managed to not only create a film which has managed to not be a flop but has also managed to be the best British Comedy Film ever! With its dark and horrific twists and turns The League of Gentlemen&#39;s Apocalypse is British Talent at its best! Its intriguing demonic storyline written by the League of Gentlemen (Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson) matches with the Gents (and guest cameos) superb acting! This I hope is not the end of Royston Vasey, not after this great success anyway! Don&#39;t think that if you have not seen The League of Gentlemen on the telly that you will not understand whats going on. Its all well explained and by the end of the film you will be happy with the result but you are still left hungry for more... Mmmm, Special Stuff.

If you liked Roman Polanski&#39;s &#34;Repulsion&#34;, you should probably check out &#34;The Tenant&#34; since it&#39;s a similar concept, just with Polanski stepping in and playing the schizophrenic wacko. This is actually one of my favorites of his movies - second, after &#34;Rosemary&#39;s Baby&#34;, of course - and is a straight forward journey into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the former apartment of a suicide victim. The other residents of the building are all flaky and sticklers on keeping the noise level down - even the slightest &#39;titter&#39; becomes a big deal and Polanski, who stars, becomes increasingly paranoid and succumbs to his loony hallucinations further and further as the film carries on. It gets to the point where he is dressing and acting like the former tenant and you realize it&#39;s only a matter of time before he decides tor re-enact her fatal leap out the window... The film is a bit slow and dawdling for a while, but if you have ever seen a Roman Polanski movie, you should know it&#39;s going to end with a bang and this flick doesn&#39;t disappoint. It&#39;s also best if you don&#39;t question the intricacies of the premise and just take it as a descent into madness, because it&#39;s pretty trippy surreal at times. Polanski is very good as the timid, deranged resident who, somehow, attracts the ever illustrious Isabelle Adjani. We also get to see him running around in drag, which is disturbing and hilarious all at the same time! Damn, he makes for one ugly chick! So, Polanski fans - who can actually look past his thirty year-old pedophile charges - should enjoy &#34;The Tenant&#34; as an entertaining psychological head-trip...

The film is about a young man, Michael, who cares for the elderly. One day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his clients. Around the same time he decides to model his killing after the Zodiac Killer of the 60&#39;s. He gets in touch with the author of a book about the Zodiac Killer and they form a friendship. Michael has a gun (aparently the only gun, as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors, only not portrayed as the same gun.) and he goes out a-killin&#39;. Original. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great film if you like B movies. I thought the idea of the movie was good, but the editing and the acting really drowned the plot. I thought the &#39;blood&#39; was just too fake, the lighting was horrible in some places, and the dialog was just too standard. The movie was shot on video, which is okay, but the editing of the film just made for some weird &#39;Plan 9&#39; scenes. Not a bad movie for fans of the B-movie genre, but if you want something with a bit more polish, move on to something else.

I am a HUGE Adam Sandler fan, and one day I was looking at the Cast&amp;Crew selection on one of his DVD&#39;s and saw &#39;Going Overboard&#39; and decided to go out and rent it. So I went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it. We put it on and we were shocked to see an Adam Sandler that didn&#39;t hit puberty yet, he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out. I couldn&#39;t even watch 30 minutes of this crap, I didn&#39;t laugh, chuckle, or even smirk at this movie, actually the only time I smirked was when I saw how horrid this movie was. I could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie...and it didn&#39;t work once. Although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script I realized why I had never heard of this movie,...because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before. This movie, in my opinion, was the WORST movie EVER made,....EVER!

Mat Spirogolou&#39;s (Toby Malone) family know he is a talented footballer, and are pleased when he secures an audition to join a big club. They hope that when he arrives in the city his cousin will look after him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the cousins are like chalk and cheese: one a naive farm boy, the other a streetwise spendthrift who has managed to get mixed up with drug dealers and gangsters. Mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having missed his cousin George (Damien Robertson) on arrival in the city, Mat encounters further trouble when a young biker takes him for a ride in more ways than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toby Malone, probably better known for his work in theatre, puts in a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager. There are telltale signs of a low budget, but as with so many other low-budget movies there&#39;s more fun, seemingly more spontaneity, and more charm, than there is to be seen in the average Hollywood blockbuster.

Gerry Anderson&#39;s first live-action foray in the way of a major motion picture that benefits from incredible model FX work and,a great Barry Gray music score. The reel-to-reel analog computers, in the far-off year &#34;2069&#34; (I guess Anderson really wanted a safe date of a 100 years later!) are a hoot to see as are the guru-jacket fashions, but one could easily accuse 2001 of the same violations, but no one could have foreseen some things as they turn out. This film was the springboard for the series UFO the following year, and in fact not only had the same FX people, and producers but many of the cast were regulars in that show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It always comes off like an &#34;alternate history&#34; future more than anything else-the &#34;Apollo-like&#34; rocket used in the lift-off, it always seems like this is really another planet than earth. Given the &#34;alternate earth&#34; plot, one would assume that was the feeling they wanted. We end up with an ending that posits more questions than answers. That because the &#34;other earth&#34; exists every movement, event and thing said is duplicated as it&#39;s happening on both worlds. Because of that given, and the sun in between, the two versions of the same person (in this case Glenn Ross, astronaut) can never meet. A complete accident discovered the planet in the first place when it would have most likely stayed a secret forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filmed mostly in Portugal with FX work in England, it&#39;s a must-own for any Gerry Anderson fan. I have the Image bare bones DVD from a few years ago now out of print, but one hopes Universal will re-release it with, perhaps extras and even a Gerry Anderson commentary.

I guess this movie will only work on people who were all turned off by the giant hype of Lord of the Rings. Well, so I was. And so I really love this movie. Especially I like all those flawless superheroes from LotR being so perfectly and disrespectfully parodied. Most brilliantly is the counterpart of Gandalf (the brave and wise and completely humorless know-it-all wizard): Almghandi, the cowardice and brain dead transvestite. Sauron&#39;s counterpart (&#34;Sauraus&#34; from East Germany, of course) is wearing a simply bucket with eye holes as a helmet. Aragorns alter ego is yet another accident prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword (&#34;Ulrike&#34; the legend) with scotch tape. And &#34;Strunzdumm&#34; (the counterpart of Wormtong) indeed has some strong resemblance with Brad Dourif! And don&#39;t forget Grmpfli and Heidi... huh-huh

Johnny Crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in the middle of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. Billy Graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet, sometimes corny, but all the way sincere flick. He gives us a look at not only the social scene but gives good, solid advice that holds true today about morals, decisions, the generation gap, teen dating, (some of the statistics that are given in this movie are astounding. They sound like today&#39;s stats). Just to see Billy in his younger days is worth seeing. It&#39;s an awesome movie. It made me realize that human nature does not change, even though hair, fashion and language may change, humans are still struggling with the same issues they have been struggling with for thousands of years.

Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, Marnie sees it as her opportunity to become beautiful. When she&#39;s denied the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and she becomes beautiful. But the formula brings out the worst in her and it&#39;s not long before she&#39;s left a string of bodies behind her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever heard the expression &#34;as exciting as watching paint dry&#34;? That pretty much sums up Satanik. During the film, one of the characters utters the line, &#34;Something so horrible, it&#39;s inconceivable.&#34; I wasn&#39;t sure if he was talking about something in movie or the movie itself. I&#39;m really disappointed because I had high hopes for this one. Satanik had possibilities, but they&#39;re never realized. At every opportunity, the plot has Marnie do the dullest things imaginable. The writing is horrible. And part of the problem is Magda Konopka. She&#39;s not that appealing and cannot carry the film on her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big problem with Satanik is the direction and editing. It&#39;s a mess. We see things and places that have no bearing on anything in the movie. The camera lingers on shots too long after the scene is over. I can&#39;t think of a single shot that would call anything but unoriginal. This group of filmmakers exhibits little in the way of imagination or talent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may not be familiar with the Italian comic on which Satanik is supposedly based, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s got to be better than this.

this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see. i was talked into it and dragged into the theater, but boy am i glad for that. i thought it was going to be just another love story, but it turns out to be SOOO much more than that. definatly an intellectual flick, one of those movies you have to pay attention to.

If I rate the film maybe a bit high, you can blame it on sentiment. This is one of the first movies that I remember seeing and totally loving. I saw it at the drive-ins here in California in the late 70s. I was already a big fan of &#34;The Muppet Show&#34; on TV so I was primed for the movie, and the movie did not disappoint. Basically it takes the whole absurdist ethos of the Muppet show and transports it from vaudeville into a road movie. Kermit the Frog is on a quest to become famous; not because he wants to take champagne baths and ride in a private jet, but because he wants to &#34;make millions of people happy.&#34; Of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way he picks up all his beloved muppet friends, most endearingly Fonzie Bear who he meets at a seedy bar doing stand-up. They sing &#34;Movin&#39; Right Along&#34;, a song that has always charmed me with its upbeat melody and its theme of friendship and shared discovery. He also encounters enough Hollywood movie stars to fill a Stanley Kramer movie, including comedy luminaries like Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle, and Mel Brooks. Brooks in particular has a rather dull bit, and you are left feeling that Henson could have cut a few of these cameos out if he wasn&#39;t afraid of offending the stars. Anyway, as befits a road trip movie like this the very first person he meets is Dom DeLuise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is one of the more odd examples of literally breaking down the 4th wall that you will find in any &#34;children&#39;s&#34; movie. The Hollywood dream seems to be crumbling all about them, when a real rainbow pierces the Hollywood set with its authentic joy and mystery. I&#39;m sure this was meant to relate to some of Jim Henson&#39;s own personal or spiritual experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best movie with Muppets by a long shot. If you or anyone else was wondering why the Muppets were so popular back in the 70s, considering how poor the movies have been for the last few decades, I think this film has at least aged well enough to provide a clue.

A kinda remake of PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES in a lot of ways.i think,i think it&#39;s such a bad and sad coincidence that both John Candy and Chris Farley left us When they still had a lot of stuff to do.God bless them both,i think the plots of 2 movies are really similar,Road Trips of two different poles of characters,and a lot of unlucky consequences because of the Chubbies, This movie can not be Planes trains and Automobiles but its a really entertaining movie especially with the great performance of Chris Farley, The missing part in this movie is the touchy stuff if we compare it with Candy&amp;Martin Classic,but i think its better this way

Considering its pedigree, this should be a far more enjoyable film than it is. Even with a lip-smacking collection of eccentrics in the cast - what aficionado would not eagerly anticipate a movie which brings together Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - the entire event is dully paced, drearily shot and, more often than not, witless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kim Novak&#39;s gifts were not essentially comic, as she went on to confirm in Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was a fine comedian, as he ably demonstrated in movies from ranging from The Philadelphia Story to Harvey. I think he comes out better from this mess than anyone else does. Except maybe the cat.

The name Uwe Boll is automatically linked to bad horror/cult cinema and every new movie he releases  which is about two, three per year  immediately always receives negative ratings and harsh criticism. You&#39;re actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype. You know, like it&#39;s popular to hate Uwe Boll whether you liked his movies or not. Let me just assure you that this is NOT the case. Uwe Boll is a terrible writer/director and quite frankly a menace to the entire film-making industry. &#34;Seed&#34; is another most unfortunate of proof that. In here, Boll tries so desperately hard to come across as controversial and shocking that he overlooks numerous other elements that any movie essentially needs to exist, like a plot, a narrative structure, character development, tension building &#34;Seed&#34; is a hideous movie, full of gratuitous filth and incompetent padding footage. I once read that &#34;Seed&#34; was Uwe Boll&#39;s interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of Torture Porn flicks, but that&#39;s not even close. The film inarguably does borrow some influences from &#34;Saw&#34; and &#34;Hostel&#34;, but basically it&#39;s just another umpteenth dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video game violence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 45 minutes of &#34;Seed&#34; are beyond boring and actually just confirm all the obvious things you already knew were going to happen. For you see, Boll was stupid enough to begin his film with a (hyper- fast) scrolling text explaining there&#39;s a federal US law claiming that death row prisoners have to be set free if three attempts to electrocute them fail. So you know this will happen later on, but still the first three quarters are wasted on catching a serial killer and bringing him to the electric chair. Seed is a mute serial killer who supposedly slaughtered 666 victims (exaggerate much?) who wears a bag over his head. He watches real-life animal cruelty footage (and thus WE watch real-life animal cruelty footage; thanks for that Mr. Boll) and videotapes people as the slowly decompose in their cellar (including a crying baby which is really sick and twisted). When he&#39;s finally captured, during the most amateurish and implausible police manhunt ever filmed, and put on death row, the film even becomes more retarded. After being buried alive because the electric chair couldn&#39;t fry him, Max Seed crawls back to the surface and goes on a brand new killing spree; this time mainly focusing on the people who arrested and executed him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The senseless plot twists and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad; they&#39;re downright infuriating and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic. Multiple twists and sub plot in &#34;Seed&#34; are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable functioning human mind because they&#39;re just too dumb! Nobody believes that cops and prison staff members will just bury a mass murderer alive without shooting a few bullets through his head first. Nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same hideout place where they first caught him! &#34;Seed&#34; is full of retarded little things like these and the movie gets dumber with each minute that passes. Personally, I refuse to accept that the cast &amp; crew members didn&#39;t notice this as well. It really makes you think that Uwe Boll simply neglects all advice and criticism, and just stubbornly shoots his movies the way he wants to. I imagine his yelling stuff like &#34;shut up and do as you are told&#34; to his actors whenever they remark that the scene they&#39;re shooting doesn&#39;t make a lick of sense. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for the fun of upsetting people, there&#39;s a gigantically overlong sequence where Max Seed smashes an elderly lady to death with a hammer whilst she&#39;s tied up to a chair in the middle of her own living room. Instead of shocking, as Boll intended it to be, this sequence masterfully epitomizes how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is. &#34;Seed&#34; is horrendous, it&#39;s disgusting, it&#39;s pitiable, it&#39;s  Boll.

Just finished watching this movie as it were playing on TV and I did&#39;nt have anything else to do. Went right here to IMDb too look on the trivia page and happened to glance at the user comments. And what do I find? Every dumb idiot raises this movie to the sky! I would&#39;nt even have written anything but when no one else takes the time to spread the word about this suck-ass movie I thought that I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting sucked from pretty much everyone in the cast. The worst one was the guy playing Brian Wilson (think I got the name right) as he were overacting, especially when he was high. The rest was&#39;nt as bad as him but no one was good neither. I ain&#39;t no expert on the beach boys though so cant really complain on the story that much.... except it sucked though. No motivation for any of the characters decisions most of the time but hey, maybe they were idiots in real life to. And what I found worst was that I thought it were going to be a movie about the beach boys, but you really only got a grip about a few of the characters. I hate when they do that in movies, same thing in the doors, even though I like that movie more. Don&#39;t have any energy left to write more... it sucked! don&#39;t buy or watch it!

DON&#39;T TORTURE A DUCKLING (Lucio Fulci - Italy 1972).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a prime candidate for the most insane movie title ever conceived and that&#39;s quite an achievement in giallo-land. Originally, the film was titled even more absurdly, &#34;Don&#39;t Torture Donald Duck&#34;, literally translated from its Italian title. A small Donald Duck figure features briefly as a toy, but hardly enough to render a title like this, but, apparently, it was changed in fear of legal ramifications by Disney. I railed quite a bit against Fulci&#39;s earlier LIZARD IN A WOMAN&#39;S SKIN (1971), but here all the right ingredients are present. A surprisingly effective mystery, a good cast and imaginatively shot against an unusual rural setting. Everything just clicks. I think it&#39;s justly hailed as one of the director&#39;s most accomplished achievements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is set against the backdrop of a small mountain-side town in Sicily, where someone is killing young teenage boys. Among the suspects, the most obvious one is a young woman, Maciara (Florinda Balkan), a self-proclaimed witch who is seen suspiciously unearthing the skeleton of a baby and sticking pins into way effigies. Guiseppe, the village idiot is under suspicion as well, since he made a feeble attempt to profit from the disappearance of one of the boys and walked right into their trap. By the time a quick-witted newshound (Tomas Milian) arrives from Milan to cover the murders, he immediately begins to question the authorities&#39; assumptions, when he meets two other potential suspects: Don Alberto, the local priest (Marc Porel) with a high-minded attitude, and Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a bored young woman from the city with a troubled past of drug offense, who also fancies having sexual relations with the young boys in town. Talk about your prime red herring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fulci nicely contrasts modernity and tradition with the newly constructed elevated highway meandering through the Sicilian hills, past old towns where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition. One could debate about the film&#39;s political stance as The North versus The South, or as commentary on small-town virtues - society&#39;s conventions in general - that are all too often dangerously close to tipping over into moral disintegration, chaos and - ultimately - self-justice by the populace. The film has often been lambasted because of its anti-catholic tone, but it&#39;s hardly an important element here, except for obvious plot-related reasons, which would be giving away too much. It&#39;s actually rather tame compared to a film like Joël Seria&#39;s DON&#39;T DELIVER US FROM EVIL (1971). Probably, the film&#39;s rather unflattering portrayal of small-town Sicilian values (when another boy is killed, the local populace are depicted as a retarded lynch-mob) might be cause for some offense in Sicily, but - considering Sicily&#39;s problematic relation with the rest of Italy - hardly problematic for other Italians, I would think. The film vanquished into obscurity far too quickly to have much impact anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When talking Fulci, the amount of gore is usually a prime subject for discussion. Although eyes-gouging scenes are lacking, the film does contain two very graphic scenes. In the gross-out finale, the killer falls of a cliff, smashing his face along the rocks on the way down with gruesome results (albeit, not very realistic). And the chain-whipping sequence with Florinda Balkan in the graveyard shows Fulci&#39;s penchant for sadistic violence and typically, he&#39;s not holding back at graphically showing what most film-makers would merely hint at. Surely, one of the most horrifying scenes in Fulci&#39;s repertoire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, this is a taut, well-written, effective little mystery, nicely lensed by Fulci, with an impressive cast of genre-regulars like Barbara Bouchet, Marc Porel (not very convincing as a priest), Tomas Milian and Florinda Balkan (mouth-foamingly crazy as the town&#39;s witch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camera Obscura --- 8/10

This movie shocked me. It was so realistic and the story was incredible touching. They talk German and Russian, which makes it more believable and real. This is a must-see movie. The actors are great too. Really a good piece of work. The plot takes place within a German troop in WWII. They have to go to Stalingrad, Sovjet, to fight against the Sovjetian armies. You get more connected with every soldier in this group and follow them through all the perils as they get captured within Stalingrad. They get face-to-face meetings with death, blood, grief and the coldness of Russia. This is a must-see-movie and you cant afford not to see it.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I reviewed this documentary because I had an interest in the subject it portrayed, the LA punks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I listened that music and I loved that music and I read a lot of the small zines that were made in the early 80&#39;s and that were not so easily achieved in Finland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you don&#39;t like this kind of music why you write here about it? I like this kind of music, it speaks my soul, thus I know punks from all over Europe &amp; Americas, so why do you, who find this music &#34;repugnant&#34; care to comment at all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I had never read Shakespeare&#39;s Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it. My view on the movie may be partially biased since I had never read the play before, but I got pulled into this movie&#39;s grasp. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever to have lived and the story of Hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now on to the movie...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that all the actors in the movie had a firm grasp of what they were saying and thus, were able to articulate it quite well. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King. The thing I liked about this was that it worked very well as a &#34;MOVIE&#34; and not as a play you are studying. You don&#39;t need to be affluent with Shakespeare to relate to all the Misery hamlet has to go through. I would recommend this movie to a wide audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s my two cents.

This movie is about Carlos &#34;The Jackal&#34; (Quinn), an international terrorist who, by CIA agent Henry Fields&#39;s (Sutherland) description, appears to maim women and children for the heck of it. At least that&#39;s what he says to guilt US Naval Officer Annibal Ramirez (Quinn again) into taking on the assignment of posing as Carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the KGB. Ramirez is apparently physically identical to Carlos but mentally he is his antithesis. He is borne of order and Carlos is borne of chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie isn&#39;t all shoot-gun-jump-around action, and that&#39;s a good thing. In its first half, Ramirez undergoes training to act and think like Carlos, and that&#39;s actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other run-of-the-mill action flicks. An Israeli agent (Kingsley), joins Fields in training Ramirez, and together they appear to take on the roles of parents in the birthing of Ramirez&#39;s new character. Ramirez is taught to dislike the things Carlos dislikes, to act on the split second like Carlos would, and even to make love like Carlos (courtesy of an ex-girlfriend of Carlos&#39;s). Naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of the movie. It&#39;s a little contrived but Quinn gives a riveting performance as a Carlos-wannabe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I liked about this movie was that it didn&#39;t utilize the much overdone plot point in evil twin movies - you know, the one in which the evil twin insinuates himself into the good twin&#39;s family. Ramirez&#39;s family does come into the picture, but instead they highlight how his new character wrecks havoc on his family life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good chuckle humor is injected into this movie, often coming the acerbic duo of Sutherland and Kingsley. An exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving Ramirez&#39;s first name (Annibal, Annabelle, get it?). Also overdone was the constant harping by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent Carlos is. In my opinion, during the final showdown, the payoff wasn&#39;t able to match the build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, the movie was enjoyable. I&#39;m not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and engrossing than the average action movie and it maintained my attention throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating: 9/10

Yes, talk about bad sequels. Rick Moranis stars in this awful third sequel to the once-funny-and-entertaining &#34;Honey I Shrunk the Kids&#34;. The concept basically plays the same way as the first film, but with the adults instead of the kids being shrunk and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore. If you think this sounds interesting, think again. The movie is boring at best, right down an embarrassment at worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the continuity of the series has been completely flushed down the toilet. The only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently Rick Moranis. The actress playing his wife has changed, the actors playing the kids have changed, the ones playing the neighbors have changed... you name it. They try to make us believe this is the same family, but the results are puzzling to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the story is a rehash of the first one, with not one bit of originality. All the few jokes (and there&#39;s barely any) and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are just copied straight from &#34;Honey I Shrunk the Kids&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third problem, the special effects. I&#39;m sure this has been done on a smaller budget, but they are pathetic, way way worse than the ones appearing in the rest of the series. You&#39;re supposed to admire in awe these tiny figures exploring the huge domestic area, but you&#39;ll probably end up cringing most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth problem, to locate the action inside the house is just boring. Only few things happen, and when they happen, they are not thrilling at all. The first movie was amusing because the kids were dealing with nature, the grass, and the bugs that live in it. In this one, the adults (which come up as rather boring, compared to the kids) deal with dust, a cockroach and a cockroach trap. Disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know why the idea of releasing such a trite sequel to the already moribund series appealed Disney&#39;s executives, except maybe because they needed to cash in without spending five minutes thinking about something new. I&#39;m warning you: leave this tasteless cash-in garbage where it should stay: getting dust on the shop&#39;s shelves.

Greetings;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I would see the day when I would be so disgusted by A movie that it would be a burden to finish it... I was always a fan of horror movies, B&#39;C and C&#39;s included. But in this case it&#39;s hard to describe how a movie could fail to qualify for any letters in that scale...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is centered on a poorly developed back story, a mix of folklore with an after taste. And to top it up, the performance of the actors is questionable. Horror B movies usually fall in two categories... 1) A gem that was under looked, and under funded 2) So bad it&#39;s funny, laugh or your money back. Well this movie falls in between. I wasn&#39;t scare, didn&#39;t laugh... So I guess if you really need to see it you could but I recommend you don&#39;t...

===========BIG SPOILER================================== This is a terrible movie with no likable characters. So many clichés and senseless scenes. It needs a good editor but then there might not be any movie left. Please save your two hours. The only decent and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother refuses to stop his brother from killing himself. The description read &#34;moments of dark comedy&#34;. Perhaps I missed those when I blinked. The horrible characters start right with the funeral. The funeral goers are laughing and complaining about the food while at the funeral of a very young man who has committed suicide? Then the father makes digs at the only son left? Right at the funeral? How is it that the next door neighbor whose husband cheated on her with Sigourney Weaver&#39;s character is the bad guy for telling the husband? The father doesn&#39;t even know his son can play the piano though everyone else around him seems to know he is a great pianist. The movie tries to shove every dramatic cliché possible into one movie: father over-driving athletic son to succeed, dysfunctional family losing a chosen son to suicide, the son left feeling lost and alone, drugs, marital affairs, child conceived via affair but raised as husband&#39;s son, incest, homosexual tendencies, bullies, possible terminal illness, etc, etc, etc. DO NOT WASTE YOUR 2 HOURS.

This is a horrid disaster of a film. From beginning to end, it&#39;s filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing. The only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by Streisand, because the Kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem of this film is that we never see Kristofferson&#39;s character at his peak or Streisand&#39;s character struggling. The first should be seen in decline and the second rising. The final Streisand number _could have been_ one of the greatest finales in film, if it was directed and edited properly. The single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. Had the band, audience and wide shots of the stage been shown, this number could have been dynamic and interesting. This film must have been directed and edited by an NYU film school dropout. The only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay. The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film, and even that is botched completely by misguided technical decisions.

Anyone can make a movie these days. Budget, production value, or experienced crew don&#39;t have to stop the self described &#34;director&#34; from &#34;realizing their dream&#34; these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respect for the craft of film-making, or even just respect for any film aesthetic are no longer prerequisites for actually executing a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Bill Cowell must have thought he struck gold when Lion&#39;s Gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a film he had nothing to do with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally find Lion&#39;s Gate far, far more in error than Cowell in regard to Dark Harvest 2 being made available to the public. Lion&#39;s Gate&#39;s deceptive marketing of this film should be investigated by the state attorney general&#39;s office and Lion&#39;s Gate&#39;s officers should be pickled in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their utter disregard for film, film-making, and good sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the film itself, it&#39;s not even worth commenting on.

Rounding out the 1929-30 all-talkie &#34;Our Gang&#34; release schedule, &#34;A Tough Winter&#34; features two storylines. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, home alone on a wintry day, decide to make some taffy. Little Wheezer relays the directions to Mary Ann from a radio cooking show. The problem: Wheezer relays information from different shows and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix! Funny moments occur when the rest of the Gang shows up to pull the taffy - and end up getting it all over the house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second storyline deals with Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor/handyman of the Gang, and his interactions with the Gang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;A Tough Winter,&#34; to my knowledge, has never been shown on television, although it is available on home video. The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization which shows a shifty, sly, and slow-moving character. &#34;Our Gang&#34; producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a &#34;skilled comic&#34; and used this &#34;Our Gang&#34; entry as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day. Understandably, Fetchit&#39;s characterization is offensive to many people today, which explains why the film has been shelved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there are some funny moments both with Fetchit and the taffy, &#34;A Tough Winter&#34; is a plodding and meandering effort. If one positive came out of this film, it was that the Hal Roach Studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies. The sound in the film is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 &#34;Our Gang&#34; films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 out of 10.

This was soul-provoking! I am an Iranian, and living in th 21st century, I didn&#39;t know that such big tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see that today, or even in 1925, on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and on-demand, but here 80 years ago, people ventured their life to go to somewhere with more grass. It&#39;s really interesting that these Persians bear those difficulties to find pasture for their sheep, but they lose many the sheep on their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I praise the Americans who accompanied this tribe, they were as tough as Bakhtiari people.

This movie is a desperate attempt to ride the skirtales of the success of the Star Wars movies. The film uses recycled footage from &#34;Battle Beyond the Sars&#34; which is another Roger Corman Sci-Fi Turd, but atleast this one is better than &#34;Battle Beyond the Stars&#34; - there is no real acting in this film (but its a Roger Corman film-What did you expect)again the entire soundtrack was done on a Keyboard/Synthasizer, the sound effects are recycled from &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34; - there are no special effects because they were recycled/rearranged space scenes from another movie, the costumes look like something right out of 1981 salvation army salvage. --ironicaly, the little boy in this film gives one helluva performance, and he&#39;d resurface again to star in the Sylvester Stallone movie &#34;Over the Top&#34; - I give this movie 3 stars out of 10

the only thing great about the movie is its title. In this case, &#34;Snake On a Plane&#34; is example of not judging the book by its cover, the title says nothing about the movie. When I went to the theater, I wasn&#39;t expecting Citizen Kane, I was expecting Independence Day, a movie that&#39;s pure popcorn fun, but instead, I got that horrible Roy Liotta movie called &#34; Turbulence&#34; Yes, this is how bad SOAP is. The only thing make SOAP better is its title. And it&#39;s not even the apporiate title for the movie, the wasn&#39;t even a glimpse of &#34;snake&#34; or &#34;plane&#34; 40 minutes into the movie! What a false advertising! If it wasn&#39;t for its title, SOAP would be just another unforgettable cheap B-grade summer movie. And the R rating? It has to be the most undeserved R rated movie of all time! The makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a R, All of the violence are kept pg-13 level. You know what&#39;s really R rated? The R rated superstar Edge! See him at Summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake!

Kudos to director and cast for such a realistic film. The grittiness, lack of glamor and desperation drew me into the film and kept me there. I was truly impressed by how dates and information were relayed within the film; ie newspapers, letters, etc. It kept the film moving at such a fast pace I didn&#39;t feel the urge to fast forward once. Personally, I thought all the principles did a tremendous job...it was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. It made me want to cry at times. Val Kilmer didn&#39;t surprise me...his performances of this nature usually leave me in awe. Overall, this is a brilliant film not to be missed!

Many of these other viewers complain that the story line has already been attempted. That may be so, but the addition of the narrator and Dr.Suess like scenery makes this show a must watch. With adult innuendo throughout the series and a touch of childhood through the set, the show is both reminiscent and invigorating. The investigative portion of the show is not what drags viewers in. The twisted plot and love lines scattered throughout this seeming paradise are what keep loyal viewers coming back for more. This is a success that ABC should never let go of. Bravo ABC. LOST was getting old, way to revitalize prime time. 9 episodes prior to the writers strike left audiences wanting more.

This is a very touching movie. This is a story about a special bond between a child and his grandfather. A villager (Arun Nalawade) brings his grandson, Parashuram, to the city to get his eyes treated. But comes to know that Parashuram (Aswin Chitale) has some rare cancer of eyes and has to undergo an operation and will lose both his eyes. The movie is all about the emotions and the turmoil both them go through and how they accept the whole thing. The movie avoid any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. Though the movie is in Marathi, language is not a barrier at all.It proves that to make good movie you do not need item songs, superstars and usual masala. Excellent performances. This is India&#39;s entry for Oscars 2004. Hope it gets the nomination at least. Would rate 10/10.

Wow! I have seen so many bad low budget films lately, but this one is great. The very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the East German coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series. I loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent cliché about the police. This film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time. A perfect tradeoff!

Help! Once again, Paul Schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull, pedantic storytelling. I rearranged a vacation so that I could see this &#34;world premiere.&#34; What a mistake! Why did Schrader even want to make an Exorcist film? Lofty intentions are fine, but if I wanted 2 hours of theological babble, I would visit my nephew&#39;s Sunday school. Father Merrin&#39;s struggle with his faith, as presented in his younger days, is a potentially interesting subject. But an Exorcist movie needs more! The relentlessly draggy presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, makes for a strange production. Who is this movie for? I didn&#39;t bother seeing the Harlin version, but at least they apparently tried to deliver some sort of visceral thrills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Exorcist series has been quite strange. The first film was excellent, but every sequel has been unloved and pointless. Why do they keep making them? I suppose Schrader made it so that he could get a lot of money. But why should we go?

God this film was just so boring apart from the music which i really loved, i mean what was the point in actually making this movie please anyone who reads this review do not watch this film, it is a waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emraan can act but was really pathetic In this film, i am actually ashamed to be one of his fans especially in this movie, it was just really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celina is just another pretty face with no lack of talent what so ever, she can&#39;t act at all, and there was no point of her being in this film, as for the other girl Radha she was okay i guess but could have done better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what a waste of time. please buy the great music and don&#39;t watch this movie.

This is not Michael Madsen&#39;s fault, he was hardly in it. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and be bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words cannot describe how idiotic it is. Sorry Michael. The cinematography was dark. All the other actors are unknowns. When watching it, it feels like a soft porn, but with no nudity or heated scenes. This movie had sexual overtones, since it is about a underground S &amp; M killer. The acting was bad, except Michael Madsen&#39;s parts. He looked like he wanted to laugh. I hope he got paid well for this lousy movie. It is something I would not be proud of. It is not even a B movie for cable, it is more like a F and it should never be shown, ever.

The dog can act...unfortunately nobody else in the cast of this sordid faux children&#39;s film can. A stray yet very clever dog insinuates himself into the lives of two motherless children, much to the chagrin of their bitter and cold-hearted father. In what can only be described as Dickensian, the evil widower forbids his children --- who may or may not be mentally challenged --- from playing with Benji. Neither the children nor Benji obeys. Soon the children are kidnapped and Benji has to help the police find them. It&#39;s only then that the old man realizes that Benji is good, not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Lester, whose only previous acting experience appears to have been playing the dim-witted Eb on GREEN ACRES plays one of the kidnappers. So does the regrettably over-utilized Deborah Walley. Walley&#39;s previous screen triumphs include BEACH BLANKET BINGO and the woeful IT&#39;S A BIKINI WORLD. She also played both Gidget and Tammy in the past and here attempts to obliterate her good-girl reputation by playing it bad! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY away from BENJI...he&#39;s a dog and this movie is a dog!

I don&#39;t see how anyone who even likes Van Damne could like this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie actually starts out with some promise. I would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent. The actions scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a great start and is good lead in to the main story. However, the film is all down hill from there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise. That is the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. One brother is supposed to be skilled in Martial Arts, but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms. How convenient when the time arises that the brother who has never picked up a gun before all of the sudden is a great marksman, and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all of the sudden doing the splits and high kicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot, action, etc. are just plain ridiculous. My favorite scenes? How about when Van Damne is confronting an armed soldier with an AK-47. The soldier is about 100 yards away. Instead of aiming and shooting at Van Damne he is doing a war cry like he is wielding a battle axe and running at him. Van Damne proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him,...while he is still about 75 to 80 yards away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie has one of the most disappointing endings. Bolo Yeung is a skilled martial artist. However, instead of choreographing a decent fight. Bolo is throwing barrels at Van Damne like Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravating movie that had so much promise. If your a Van Damne fan, save your time and see Hard Target or one of his earlier films.

Low budget horror about an evil force. Hard to believe in this day and age, but way back when this stuff actually used to get theatrical release! These days this sort of thing would either go direct-to-video or straight to cable. Shouldn&#39;t be too hard to avoid this one; who&#39;s ever heard of it?

This is really a great unknown movie.Perfect dialogue without the typical clichés.This movie relied on the actor&#39;s talent and it was pulled off.It even had a little bit a comedy in it,but it wasn&#39;t overdone.Once in the Life is what a crime drama is supposed to be,not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in.I especially loved the interracial aspects of it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal.It&#39;s a shame that he&#39;s only allowed to show his talent in his own movie. Titus Welliver was fabulous as Fishburne&#39;s junky half-brother. Eamonn Walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a grease monkey/drug lord.I loved his acting since &#34;King of New York&#34;. But the best acting in this film came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan,who were paired perfectly as two of Calderon&#39;s henchmen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in the Life is for sure a keeper. ****1/2* out of *****.

Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun (but rehashed and overdone) Bush jokes. Apparently I should have lowered my expectations even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing was absolutely pathetic. Aside from the Cheney-Chicken-Eating joke, and some giggly-little swipes, it was really boring and unfunny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteen-year old&#39;s Flash Project. It&#39;s disgraceful that they used Macromedia&#39;s product for this, because it&#39;s capable of so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t like Bush that much, and I enjoy a Bush-joke as much as the next guy, but this was just a half-hour swipe at the President with several painfully un-funny moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did so much more with That&#39;s My Bush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor, skip &#34;Lil&#39; Bush&#34; and go buy a copy of the short-lived comedy &#34;That&#39;s My Bush&#34;. You&#39;ll thank me.

This film is a great comedy drama. Christopher Walken is tremendous in his supporting role as manager, and his commentary will keep you laughing. Robin Williams plays a great role as a quick wit &#34;Jon Stewart&#34; and will amuse you if you are fans of Comedy Central. The show is good, because if the viewer has half-a-brain, they will see it as a very needed sub-cultural attack on the policies of the current Republican Government and a criticism on the American Democratic Process..., not to mention the means by which most politicians get elected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amused at the sub-plots and found the film to be very fast paced and entertaining, without any of the usual &#34;oh-brother&#39;s&#34; I would agree the film is less comedy than marketed, however, without question better than 90% of the garbage in theatres at present. Just my thoughts...Don

I have to agree with most of the other posts. Was it a comedy? a drama? to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side. I could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived. Jamie keeps running into the Julio and whats his name. In New York, how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown Cleveland.And just how could Robert Pastorelli dig up Yankee Stadium to hide the gold. Again, a comedy or drama? But it was still entertaining especially for a Sunday morning. I enjoyed Kimberly Elise&#39;s performance, she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously. She is a younger actress that is going to be viable.

The very first time I saw this I recoiled in HORROR at what was being presented as modern, liberated women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but I cannot relate to whining idiots whose lives revolve around loveless sex and the acquisition of Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton labels. The troubling thing is that some may actually think this is how career women live in NYC. It&#39;s definitely not. These women are incredibly shallow and materialistic and as another reviewer said, they act like gold-digging hooches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not liberated womanhood and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s gone. 0 stars and just plain AWFUL

a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like &#34;Debbie does Dallas&#34;. Nowhere close. I think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever. Even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time. But I read somewhere that back in those days, porn had to have some &#34;artistic&#34; value. I was unable to find it though. See it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream, or can appreciate art in porn movies. I know I am not. But the director of the movie appears to be a talented person. He even tried to get Simon &amp; Garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs. Of course, they rejected.

First off, I must admit that both films I&#39;ve seen by this director I saw without titles and so may have missed the points. My Czech isn&#39;t bad but, having sat through two of his films, I wish I hadn&#39;t even tried to learn. Samotari is too cool. Way too cool. It&#39;s about ten different story lines that weave in and out together. That&#39;s not so deeply unusual in a town the size of Prague (tiny, really.) The main characters are between 20 and 30. They&#39;ve got jobs and only one studies. The best character is the young Balkan girl. Her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day. That&#39;s about it. The only great character. Everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own. How can I sympathise with such obvious incompetence? Perhaps there are interesting bits with Japanese tourists but do I need another stereotype in film? If you like alright music, see this film. If you want to laugh at others&#39; stupidity, see this film. If you like irony and dry humor, see an original Jarmusch not an imitation. And under NO circumstances see Ondricek&#39;s film, Septej (Whisper.) That is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes.

Joseph Conrad&#39;s novel, Heart of Darkness is a dark, profound, and lasting novel that portrays the futility and irony taking place in Africa. If you are looking for a great book to read over the weekend this is not the book for you. Conrad holds nothing back when describing 19th century imperialism, but the novel is meaningless without giving it the reflection and consideration it deserves. If I read this novel looking for a great adventure story I would say that I wasted my time, but looking at in the perspective of explaining the futility of 19th century civilization, I would say this is one of the most significant novels I have ever read. Because of the fact that I read this novel in my English class, and we analyzed every page, I think I appreciated the book more than someone would who was just reading it for entertainment. I am not going to lie, this book was difficult and it challenges the reader to dig deep into this novel to find the true meaning. The movie on the other hand I found tiresome and boring. The movie, &#34;Heart of Darkness&#34; comes no where near giving the book justice. The movie left out many key parts that I consider important to get the true message of the story. If you are having difficulty understanding and visualizing the novel then the movie might be a good recourse but I would not recommend seeing the movie as an alternative to the novel or even a different perspective.

It takes a lot for a movie to reach the already numb particles of my brain which have not already been tapped out due to the overcharge and redoredoredocopycopycopy world of movies. But this movie has made it onto my &#39;Magic Movies&#39; list. To become a &#39;magic movie&#39;, it must leave every string of my being quivering in that which I can only define as &#39;bliss&#39; and &#39;complete satisfaction&#39;. This movie has tapped into the fibers of how my mind thinks and if not for the deeply personal bond my head and the head of whoever made this shares, it would look like another &#39;dead rave scene&#39; movie from back when the 90&#39;s exploded with its Ecstasy craze. This is not how the movie came off to me at all. It&#39;s reached into me and pulled up something that I thought was dead for a very long time and pushed me as far as to give it a critique of my own. I forgot how long it&#39;s been since I&#39;ve seen something that left me feeling this good inside. I strongly suggest seeing this movie.

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. While featuring good actors the movie doesn&#39;t live up to the expectations. The most dramatic thing about this movie is the music, which pretty much sums up the movie: compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known-good actors, loud and dramatic music. It doesn&#39;t change the fact, that this is a very boring movie to watch. Earned itself a score of 1.

I went into this movie hoping for the best. I like wartime musicals in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did good jobs with their roles; however, the writers gave them boring dialog. The love-interest between the two of them was not given any real growth; just suddenly it was there. I did not think much of the music; the best number was the snippet we heard of Spike Jones with &#34;Der Fuhrer&#39;s Face.&#34; The one complete number that Spike Jones did had little of his great musical comedy; pretty tame stuff,even with the monkey. Bert Lahr&#39;s comedy skits were interminable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were parts to enjoy: Lucille Ball was quite a looker, and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen.

I bought Jack-O a number of months ago at a Blockbuster video sale, and at the time I wasn&#39;t expecting anything outstanding from it. Upon watching it, I realized I not only got less than I could have ever bargained for, but a whole lot more as well. It seems, strange, I know. And it is. But it&#39;s perfectly fitting when you consider that the utter weirdness that is &#34;Jack-O&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie follows a young boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow, thru ancestral ties, he is marked for death at the hands of a demented, scythe wielding Pumpkin man. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn&#39;s Great-grandfather-uncle-cousin-etc, and now that the villain has been resurrected, Shawn&#39;s death is apparently crucial to his hell-bred mission of vengeance. Anyway, much &#34;horror&#34; ensues as Jack-O hacks his way thru various neighbors before battling Shawn to the finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not so much here to discuss the plot as I am to determine who may find any worth in this movie. I can honestly tell you that Jack-O is one of the most poorly made movies in the history of time. The acting is deadpan (except when it should be), the script is apparently a 1st grade group project, and the production budget must not have exceeded $150. Some of the most laughable death scenes are carried out in this anti-thriller, and they&#39;re all the more humorous when you realize director Steve Latshaw actually seems serious in his movie-making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet I heartily enjoyed the film. I can call it a terrible horror movie, yes. But I can also say I had a great time watching it with my friends, and have watched it several times since that fateful first viewing. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this movie intolerable and needlessly time-consuming, and that&#39;s understandable. If you&#39;re like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that take themselves seriously, you&#39;ll find Jack-O an instant classic, which is also understandable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s why it&#39;s so hard to rate this movie. If I were rating Jack-O&#39;s quality as a film, I wouldn&#39;t give it anything. In fact, the studio would owe me stars. Yet if I were rating it&#39;s on the basis of pure enjoyment, I&#39;d give it an 8 or a 9. I&#39;ll give it a 4, so to be somewhere in the middle. I recommend everyone go out, rent this, and form their own conclusion.

First off I really enjoyed Zombi 2 by Lucio Fulci. This film was utter trash. I couldn&#39;t stand to watch it. The storyline was a joke, the acting was a joke, and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombi 2 is even more a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We jump from Voodoo to DEATH 1 THE HARMFUL AGENT BRINING People BACK TO LIFE. Whatever, this movie isn&#39;t worth the $1.00 it cost to rent it. I really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this one was horrible. If Zombi 3 is an indicator for how zombi 4 and 5 are going to be I think I will just skip them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zombi 2 is an awesome flique tho.

Sophmoric this film is. But, it is funny as all get out. It shows the &#34;boys locker room mentality&#34; being played by the &#34;other side&#34;. It is good to see such tides turned and how silly they are. But that&#39;s probably not news to most women, &#39;cause (just ask one), &#34;they&#39;ve heard &#39;em all before&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch it with a small group or party of mixed gender and 97.3% of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight. And the other 2.7%...can you ever really please them?

This film has to be viewed in the right frame of mind. First, the central father-son relationship makes it pretty clear that the film was intended as a prequel to his Wong Fei Hung film &#34;Drunken Master&#34; (ideas from this film recur in &#34;Drunken Master II), and not &#34;Young Master&#34;; that Chan backed away from this plan and renamed the characters indicates that he himself was not convinced the material was coming together properly; and, indeed, the film conveys a sense of being incomplete; for instance, the romantic relationship around which half the plot turns is left utterly hanging at the end of the film. &#34;Young Master&#34;, from the same period, also feels underdone, but at least all its central threads are tied together at the end. This film feels as though Chan wrestled with the plot and characters trying to find his central theme, only to abandon the effort, possibly due to time and budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or perhaps the film is simply over-ambitious. This is an important turning point film in Chan&#39;s career, because he commits himself to development of the central character above all other concerns - which is why there&#39;s such a lack of kung fu throughout the film. Chan wants to make an historical romantic comedy that just happens to have kung fu in it. But both the historical element and the romantic element come across as little more than plot-twists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That leaves us with the comedy. Since Chan&#39;s concern is character-development, the comedy is largely character driven - as in the conflict between Chan&#39;s character and his best friend, an argument over a girl. But there&#39;s plenty of slapstick as well. Frankly, I find the comedy amusing enough to forgive the incompleteness of the plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film represents an effort on Chan&#39;s part to find a viable formula that he can use and develop over time. It doesn&#39;t quite work, and Chan would only find that formula after abandoning the historical elements of his earlier films, with the making of the contemporary action comedy &#34;Police Story&#34;. But going back to view this film is still very informative as to how Chan worked his way through the historical genre, and perhaps why he abandoned it.

I can not believe the positive reaction to this movie. I had great expectations for it and was disappointed. First of all, they used every cheesy racism cliché in the book. It was so predictable. For instance, from the second the young Latino guy showed up you just knew that he would be a really nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger. Matt Dillon&#39;s character has been played a million times, a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie. The predictability hardly ended with those characters. A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. The morals of the story were PC to the max. There were a few clever twists but not nearly enough. The dialouge was embarrassing at times. It wasn&#39;t all bad.I just can&#39;t believe this movies high score so far. It was somewhat entertaining, just a little insulting to ones intelligence. I admire what this movie was trying to achieve but it fell well short.

Maybe it&#39;s because I saw the movie before reading the book, but I really love this movie. I&#39;ve seen it many many times and will be watching it many times more. It&#39;s a compelling story, that&#39;s interesting from the beginning to the end. It has everything: action, romance etc.

This movie is not only about feelings and human emotions, it is also about everything that could be but it&#39;s not. Poetry in movies can be awfully boring and annoying, but this movie is delightful to be watched. Not to mention the amazing Irène Jacob, a great actress in France - one of the best, actually. When the movie ends, you can only feel sorry. After all, when something is truly great, we want more (Well, for another great movie by K Kieslowsky with Irène Jacob we can always watch La double vie de Veronique)

This film, which is based on a true story, comes from first time director and long time actor, Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington has given us some of the best performances of the last decade, as a black soldier in the Civil War in Glory, and a lawyer in the acclaimed Philadelphia. And of course, he made special notoriety last year when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in Training Day, in which Denzel Washington became the first African American to receive the award for Best Actor. I guess Denzel wanted a change of pace, so he chose to direct Antwone Fisher, in which he also stars. Fisher is played by Derek Luke, who is new to the silver screen, but has made some guest appearances on such television shows as King of Queens, and he will be appearing in the upcoming film release of Biker Boyz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	This is a truly well done film from Denzel Washington, considering it was his first time directing. Undoubtedly, Denzel felt some kind of commitment and believed in the real life story of Antwone Fisher. Antwone Fisher is about a young African American man in the Navy who constantly gets into fights, and after one particular brawl he is sent to see a Navy psychiatrist named Jerome Davenport, played by Denzel Washington. Davenport helps Antwone to deal with his troubled past and learn to move on with his life, by finding his birth mother who had to give him up at birth because she was in prison. What makes this film good is the fact that it&#39;s not overly melodramatic. I was expecting something a little more like Good Will Hunting, with a lot of swearing, fighting and vulgarity. Not that I didn&#39;t like Good Will Hunting, or the swearing, fighting and vulgarity of the film were out of place. Quite the contrary! However, Antwone Fisher is a true story, and I don&#39;t think that Washington wanted to sensationalize the story for dramatic affect in the film. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are moments when we see Antwone fighting, carrying on and having moments when it seems like the world is closing in on him. After all, in his first session with his psychiatrist, the character played by Washington, Devenport asks Fisher where he was born, and Fisher&#39;s response is, `from under a rock,&#39; an obvious jab at the pressures waning on Antwone Fisher&#39;s soul. But I had to appreciate the fact that this film wasn&#39;t sensationalized for dramatic affect. I think it shows real character on the part of Denzel Washington to deliver a more realistic story and to avoid the typical clichés that are common in Hollywood films, even those based on true stories. One other point that I would like to bring up about Antwone Fisher is the acting. Over all, performances were good in the film, but not great. At times, I think it was a bit obvious that the main characters were actors, but overall, to complain about performances in this film would be ludicrous. One actress that I would like to point out in this film is Viola Davis. She plays Antwone&#39;s mother, but she says barely two sentences in the movie at all, but not so much because she appears at the end of the film, but more because she in shock that her long lost son, Antwone has found her. What I would like to point out about her as an actress in the lack of use of her. She in basically a character actress, and I haven&#39;t seen her play any really elaborate roles. She made appearances in Traffic, Out Of Sight, Kate &amp; Leopold, and two recent films: Far From Heaven and Solaris. In Steven Soderberg&#39;s remake of Solaris, she played a scientist on a doomed space craft orbiting a planet. In that film, she is confronted by George Clooney&#39;s character and she drawn to tears by what Clooney tells her in a particular scene. When I first saw Solaris, I remember seeing her tear up in the scene and thinking, wow, this woman can act. It was as if you could feel the character&#39;s grief. In that brief shot of her face, she gave so much expression and I honestly felt very sorry for her character&#39;s sadness and trouble in the film. I think she has definite potential as an actress and should be used more often perhaps in leading roles, rather than just as a character driven actress. Nonetheless, Antwone Fisher is a very good movie. Denzel Washington, as always, pulls off a great performance and he gives us a great directorial debut. Also, Derek Luke is a very talented actor. I think that Antwone Fisher will bring his immense critical fame for his portrayal of the troubled man, but I think that his public popularity will increase with the release of Biker Boyz, which also stars Lawrence Fishburn. Antwone Fisher is based on the book `Finding Fish: A Memoir,&#39; by Antwone Quenton Fisher. ***

Hellraiser: Bloodline is only a so-so film. I believe it&#39;s the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I missed the beginning, and all I remember from there was some topless women and a box-shape thing on a computer screen. But, using my wit and intelligence, (and the Info Button) I soon found out that the villain (Pinhead) was released from Pandora&#39;s Box, which, I believe is a gateway straight to Hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, anyways, Pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the &#34;Toymaker&#39;s&#34; family. And, that&#39;s about it. Oh, and not to mention the random tortures of various people that cross his path. Yawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What mainly happens in this film is that Pinhead captures the kid, and then unleashes the dog on his wife, and then kills a random person. Then he husband comes along, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? Why it fails is because Hellraiser: Bloodline is too corny to be scary. Look at Pinhead&#39;s minion of creatures: a cheesy dog that looks like it&#39;s been turned inside out, two men whose heads and bodies are connected together, (Siamese twins in a horror film?) and some person who is supposed to be a princess of some sort. (I haven&#39;t seen the previous films.) Now look at the main villain. His name is Pinhead. Isn&#39;t that the name you call somebody when they&#39;re stupid? He has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers, and he has blue skin. I suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn&#39;t have such a corny name, and a corny speech. Somewhere in the film, two cops approach him and say &#34;Don&#39;t make us put some pain on you!&#34; Pinhead replies &#34;Pain? How dare you use that word! I AM pain&#34; blah, blah, blah, blah blah. It sounds a bit cliché if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t forget the final half of the movie. The characters (and audience) get to experience more torture when Pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum. Some person who we don&#39;t recognize (Maybe he was in the previous films. I don&#39;t remember him in the beginning of the movie.) This scene is basically one thing played over and over again: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A guard goes to inspect a mysterious noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other guard: &#34;Oh no! He&#39;s down. I will go check on himby myself!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After he dies the same thing happens again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(SPOILERS) Here&#39;s the thing I didn&#39;t get. In the film Pinhead is supposedly sent to Oblivion at the end. So, how does he come back for another four films? Are they prequels? Why hasn&#39;t he died in the previous ones? Geez. The makers need to come up with an idea for a different series. (END OF SPOILERS) Hellraiser: Bloodline is gory and full of torture scenes, but has little thrill or scare value. Just forget it. Bad special effects with badeverything else make this more of a snooze-fest than a good horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: Wellsome people may enjoy the topless women in the beginning. Plus, Pinhead&#39;s voice is pretty cool. I suppose if you like ultra-violence, you might like this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: None of the reasons above make this a very good film. The corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad. And, who names their villain Pinhead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.

I gave this film my rare 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first began watching it and realized it would not be a film with a strong plot line I almost turned it off. I am very glad I didn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a character driven film, a true story, which revolves mainly around the life of Rachel &#34;Nanny&#34; Crosby, a strong, beautiful (inside and out)Black woman and how she touched the lives of so many in the community of Lackawanna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly interesting not only its strong characterizations of Nanny and the people who lived at her boardinghouse, but also it gives us a look at what life and community were like for African Americans in the 1950&#39;s, prior to integration, and the good and bad sides of segregation and how it ultimately affected and changed the Black community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to excellent performances by all members of the cast, there is some fine singing and dancing from that era.

After seeing Undisputed 2, I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shepherd: Border Patrol is a decent flick (not Van Damme&#39;s best, but definitely not his worst.) There is some bad acting from VD&#39;s supporting cast, but it makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storyline and plot has all been done before, so it&#39;s nothing new. I mean this is Van Damme. We don&#39;t really expect much of an amazing plot do we? So lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway: the fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without giving anything away, I thought the way the fights were filmed and shot were well done, way better than a few of VD&#39;s recent movies such as Second in Command, in which the entire end fight is HORRIBLE. With Florentine behind the camera, and if you&#39;ve seen Undisputed 2, he seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it. A few of the fights in The Shepherd reminded me of VD&#39;s older stuff which is what we all want to see. The fights were good, and i said &#34;hah, awesome&#34; out loud a few times. But I was hoping for just a bit more considering how good I thought Undisputed 2 was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something I found intriguing was VD&#39;s daughter in the film, I thought &#34;wow she&#39;s kinda hot&#34; come to find out, its Bianca Van Varenberg, JC&#39;s real life daughter. I have never seen her before so that was a nice treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this movie is not half bad. Yeah the story has been done before but at least JC was attempting to make a good movie. Next time though, add more hand to hand combat! I think He still has what it takes to do another big budget movie...his acting has improved since he&#39;s been doing DTV&#39;s and he really is in great shape at 47. I don&#39;t know about you but I&#39;m one of the ones who thinks that most of his DTV&#39;s are actually good with the exception of Derailed. All he needs to do is get back into &#34;bloodsport&#34; shape, and make a martial arts movie...and I think people would respond well even though he&#39;s not jet Li. This movie is definitely worth the rental. =)

1st watched 6/21/2001 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Emmanuel Itier): Pretty much worthless supposed thriller that spends more time drawing us into sexual encounters with and without the star &#39;Amber Smith.&#39; It tries to wrap a story around the sex scenes but as usual with these types of movies it is not done very well. I was so bored with this movie that I actually fast-forwarded thru the ending to get it over with. The video version I watched was called &#39;Tell Me No Lies.&#39;

Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) has spent most of her life caring for her father. Now that he has died she is free--but doesn&#39;t know what she wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who has fled a monastery to taste more of life. They meet accidentally in Algiers, fall in love and get married. But he can&#39;t leave his past behind and she can&#39;t live without him...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WAY overdone romance full of hysterically bad dialogue and situations. Dietrich and Boyer do their best to give good performances but NOBODY could get away with some of their lines! Still, in a way, it is a classic. It&#39;s shot in gorgeous Technicolor (try to see it on DVD) where every frame is breath-takingly beautiful. Dietrich is always dressed to the 9s (even in the middle of the desert) and strikes hysterical poses to show off the clothes and her body. Boyer just walks around looking stricken (no shock there). Still I was never bored. It was wonderful to look at and the non-stop stupid dialogue kept me in stitches. The end almost had me falling out of my chair because I was laughing so hard! Now I love corny romances and give them plenty of space but really---this is unbelievable! It also runs a very short 80 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a camp classic I give this an 8. As a serious movie--a 1.

This film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. The writer obviously bought the playbook &#34;How to write a space disaster movie&#34; and followed it play by play. In particular, the stereo-typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the project. But, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $50 thousand. To learn that the film was nominated for a &#34;Special Visual Effects&#34; Emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a handful of high school students with a pass in Media Studies could have created more believable effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the plot holes are too numerous to mention. But I will pick one out as an example. Now, I&#39;m no NASA expert, but surely it&#39;s highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program. Surely there is someone more experienced at Mission Control who the Program Director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only saving grace for this film is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this film 2 out of 10, with the above-average work of Bill Campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.

Reasonably effective horror/science-fiction a la &#34;Alien&#34; is fairly well done given its limited ambitions. Some nice special effects and well paced action sequences adequately patch the cracks in the rather tiresome dialogue. When a space craft crash lands on a remote planet the survivors soon become aware that a hideous terror awaits them in the dark of the upcoming total eclipse.

Cat Soup at first seems to be a very random animated film. The best way I&#39;ve been able to explain it is that it&#39;s quite acidic. Though it&#39;s not totally random. The story is about Nyatta, a young cat boy and his sister Nyaako. Nyaako is very ill and dies, however, Nyatta sees her soul being taken away by death and is able to retrieve half of it. The story is about their quest to bring Nyaako fully back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though a lot of the content in this movie seems completely random, it is not. Most of it is symbolism for life, death and rebirth. You can also see references from other tales, such as Hansel and Gretal. This strangely cute short film has an interesting story, packed with a deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen.

It&#39;s not real flashy, but this movie does a great job of developing a large cast of characters, and letting you know their hopes and desires, while still managing to be both funny and bittersweet. A very sweet movie. Fun, also, to see Vincent D&#39;Onofrio and Mary-Louise Parker so early in their careers.

Nothing could have saved this movie, not even Superman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years ago the special effects would have been amazing. Better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performances out of the actors. But nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it. Plot holes, bad lines, terrible pacing, endless replaying of the same shots of a CGI dragon stomping through hallways... ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this one at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In my opinion, A GUY THING is a hilarious, witty, sexy, romantic, and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy. I thought that Jason Lee and Julia Stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom-to-be and his soon-to-be sexy cousin-in-law. If you ask me, they lit up the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before I wrap this up, I&#39;d like to say that the performances were top grade, the direction was flawless, the production design was nice, the casting was perfect, and the costumes were perfectly designed. In conclusion, to anyone who&#39;s a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, I recommend this movie. You&#39;re in for lots of laughs and thrills, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.

I&#39;ve seen a fair few films from the Far East recently.....some were excellent (Battle Royale, Infernal Affairs, the Eye), and some were not so great (Versus, The Triple Cross). Then there are ones like Uzumaki and Returner, which while flawed I still enjoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic premise involves the mysterious and horrific effects that a growing obsession with spirals has upon a community. Sound silly? Yeah, thats what I was thought. Firstly, the good stuff. Direction was top notch, sure a bit over the top in places but never the less interesting and stylish. Secondly the story, was original and like other writers commented very lovelace-esq...it was interesting. What it reminded me most of however was early Cronenberg; films like Shivers and Videodrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting wasn&#39;t great, but not too horrible either. To be honest I was actually bored on a few occations....I felt the pacing especially initially was a little slow. My main problem was that it was too silly and funny to be true horror, and yet not so enough to be considered a comedy. *SPOILERS* below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*SPOILERS* Some good scenes (washing machine =)) and I liked the final shot/voiceover. At first I thought it ended far too abruptly but about 20 seconds later I realised the meaning and liked the end. However, because of the lack of seriousness in the story, combined with over the top scenes such as the news report at the school ment that I did not care for the characters much in the end. The final scene which was perhaps supposed to be a little poignent, while in reality I couldn&#39;t really care for the girl or her boyfriend. *SPOILERS END*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I kinda did like this film, but it frustrated me and I think there was real potential in addition to some good scenes. Couple of other points, the main girl is quite pretty and cute, and the song that plays at the end is good too. I rated it 7/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

***Minor Plot Spoilers***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must confess to having a soft spot for Wayne Crawford. I know little about him, but he appears to have masses of enthusiasm to compensate for his lack of talent. In his films he usually performs multi-tasks - perm any 3 from lead male, director, producer and script-writer - tackling story lines from the sub-basement. Despite this the end product is usually enjoyable fun for the non-discerning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;The Evil Below&#39; features Crawford as a down-on-his-luck Captain of a ramshackle charter boat, a bit like Bogart in &#39;To Have &amp; Have Not&#39; - the similarities between the films ends here though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story begins with an underwater scene with two divers searching a wreck, before being attacked by an unseen creature - bit like the start of &#39;Jaws 2&#39;. The wreck turns out to be that of the &#39;El Diablo&#39;, which went down centuries earlier. The ship was manned by heretic priests on the run from Spain, with a cargo of stolen Church treasure. This allows the introduction of various links to supernatural forces with Lucifer and The Armageddon both getting a look in. The films title refers to this sunken Devil-ship, rather than any malevolent sea-creature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever faults the film has (and there are many) it is fun to watch and competently made. You can&#39;t help but like a film which, in the final 5 minutes, copies the famous beach scene in &#39;From Here to Eternity&#39; and the final line from &#39;Casablanca&#39;.

This is just one of those films which cannot justify much of anything that happens. These people are going on a trek: the young girl wants to photograph animals. There really are no Piranhas, but I guess the psychotic hunter guy is the real piranha. Anyway, there are lots of animals and there is lots of driving. There is considerable anti-gun talk, but we all know where that is going. Toward the end, there&#39;s lots of action and a rape thrown in. Somebody must pay, and they do. It would have been nice to have a couple of piranhas to sort of fill the thing out. There were lots of monkeys. If you fast forward through the dull parts, you have a tight little five minutes.

(This review contains a huge spoiler, but I don&#39;t know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away) I saw &#34;pinoccio&#39;s Revenge&#34; a while ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you might think it&#39;s just a rip-off of Child&#39;s play. Indeed there are similarities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Chucky was a possessed doll who works independently of the kid. It is POSSIBLE that Pinoccio is possessed with a demon or cursed or something. however, the puppet itself is actually completely inanimate. The KID is insane, and THE KID is the one killing people! Everyone, including the audience, the survivors and the Kid herself thinks it&#39;s the doll. But it&#39;s the KID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nudity is almost a pity, because otherwise I could tell everyone to see it, because it really is an interesting horror movie.

Well...I like Patricia Kaas. She is a beautiful lady and an extremely gifted and versatile singer. Her acting in this film is more than competent and from my point of view about the only redeeming feauture of this film. She very gently captures the essence of the lonely singer with a very serious helath problem. However what I tremendously dislike about the film is the shameless product placement for a well known French chain of hotels. The other thing is that the story seems to meander for way to long without really deciding what the film is about and what it wants to be. On a positive note you may argue that the film is not predictable but you could also say it&#39;s plainly boring because of the lack of cohesion. There are some nice shots in the film bujt you can&#39;t help thinking that all the parts just don&#39;t add up to anything at all. It really is a pity bevcause Kaas really shines in this film.

These guys are anything but the Usual Suspects! They are a total bunch of likeable oddballs who you want to see get away with it,but they are so hapless that there is very little chance of that.No one is better than William H Macy at portraying the man with a big heart but down on his luck.This is probably his best performance since Fargo.Sam Rockwell played the meathead boxer to perfection,and the rest of the gang were uniformly good also.Luis Guzman brought some great comic relief as Cosimo,and George Clooney stole every scene in his cameo role.The heist scene at the end was absolutely hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The direction was also spot on by the Russo brothers.There was certainly a Coen brothers feel to the film throughout and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers.They have a long way to go to match the Coen&#39;s but this is an excellent start and I look forward to their next celluloid outing. .......&#34;Yo mutha&#39;s a whore&#34;!

This movie probably isn&#39;t the funniest I&#39;ve ever seen, and it CERTAINLY doesn&#39;t have much redeeming value. In fact, it is really nothing more than a collection of vignettes tied together by a loose plot. However, this &#34;make-it-up-as-I-go-along&#34; attitude actually works to the film&#39;s advantage. &#34;Tommy Boy&#34; succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that the SNL skits Farley and Spade starred in succeeded: their well-timed extemporaneous silliness and mayhem makes them humorous despite their immaturity.

Anyone who has said that it&#39;s better than Hostel is talking complete crap, believe me I&#39;m not a fan of Hostel but this is just ridiculous. This is just another shot on camcorder, straight to DVD, low on ideas waste of your time, I can&#39;t believe how many of these films there are and I&#39;m yet to see a decent one. In the 80&#39;s video nasties, gore and horror movies were made with no budget but a great story and a load of new ideas and most importantly the heart and soul of the director who had something to say. Now they just seem to be pumped out in an attempt to trick people browsing in Blockbuster to rent a copy, until people stop doing this then I guess these films will keep appearing. This film is so low on ideas it&#39;s just amazing how it ever got made, the acting is also terrible, the location completely unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying it beggars belief. This waste of time has absolutely nothing going for it, unless you&#39;re on a quest to compile a list of the worst movies of all time. My best/worst part of the film is when a female character is pointing a gun at someone and threatening to shoot them if they don&#39;t back off, you can see that she isn&#39;t even covering the trigger with her finger just holding the grip. An absolute joke.

1956&#39;s The Man Who Knew Too Much is exceptional entertainment. To those who prefer the 1934 original, I will say that that one is faster paced and wittier. However, even though the American version was (heaven forbid!) a big budget blockbuster, I believe it blows the British version out of the water. I think this is one of Hitchcock&#39;s 10 best-no small feat considering he made over 50 films and many of them were among the greatest of all time. I find so many things to love:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)James Stewart, America&#39;s favorite everyman for so many years, does an excellent job playing the distressed father here. He can make any film enjoyable, and working with such a likeable character in such a gripping story, he had me rooting for him very intensely. Leslie Banks in the original is nothing in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)Doris Day. Yes Doris Day. Despite all the criticisms directed toward her, I think she makes the loving wife/mother an extremely sympathetic person. I disagree with the negative remarks towards her character; just because she is soft-spoken and gentle it doesn&#39;t mean she is docile and helpless. I don&#39;t want to spoil anything, but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed. She gives the story a level of warmth that just wasn&#39;t there in the first one, and for those who care about that this version is the way to go. And I loved Que Sera Sera; I think it is one of the most beautiful songs I&#39;ve ever heard and deservedly won its Oscar. It elevated the film to another level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)The Albert Hall sequence. I don&#39;t think it was too long at all; I think the suspense built the whole time to that terrific crescendo and Hitchcock&#39;s direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant. And the assassin was truly frightening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)The ending really put a smile on my face; even after the aforementioned scene was over I found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again. The last line in the film is highly amusing. I don&#39;t think the film started out slowly; Hithcock was trying to get us to know and like the McKennas and he did a great job. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the kid playing Hank, but I didn&#39;t have a problem with him. Since Hank was Ben and Jo&#39;s kid I cared about him too; it&#39;s not like he was a brat or anything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found no major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues. Way to go Hitch!

I am not surprised to find user comments for this film full of gushy nonsense, such as that this film &#34;[proves] that when it is predestined, love will find a way.&#34; I begin in this way, not to criticize a specific reviewer, but because this citation so typifies the hyperbolic, uncritical treacle that was poured out over this film, even before it hit the theaters. Even the best of films do not &#34;prove&#34; anything, nor are they intended to. The best films entertain and move the viewer, and &#34;The English Patient&#34; fails on both criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember the studio&#39;s promotion of &#34;The English Patient&#34; very clearly: &#34;From the producers of &#39;Amadeus&#39; and &#39;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest,&#39;&#34; it grandly announced. An ignorant or careless listener might miss the crucial word, &#34;producers,&#34; in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of &#34;The English Patient,&#34; so very inappropriately, with the truly great director, Milos Forman. Such a comparison is offensive to the memory of Mr. Forman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the novel by Michael Ondaatje upon which the film was based, is a good one, it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever. Aside from plot elements that seem only coincidentally similar, the film bears little resemblance to the novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite misgivings which began when I heard that shamelessly misleading promotion, I went to see this film in the theater. As it began to unfold, I realized that the rendering of the novel&#39;s peculiar magic had failed, that the actors knew their words but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, dull, and unengaging. The film was a complete travesty of Ondaatje&#39;s novel and a completely still-born cinematic artifact of the worst description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who gush over this film are very apt to speak with adjectives like, &#34;sweeping,&#34; and &#34;grand,&#34; and &#34;hypnotic.&#34; Well, it is none of those. In fact, not even Ondaatje&#39;s fine novel could be described as &#34;sweeping&#34; or &#34;grand.&#34; It could be described as &#34;magical&#34; and &#34;hypnotic&#34; -- yet these are precisely the qualities that the film so utterly failed to deliver. It is almost as if Minghella had, as a reader, entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could grind out on celluloid only a pale, skeletal version, a version that not only missed the spirit of the story, but that focused on the wrong characters. He produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for story&#39;s metaphors but no apparent cognizance of them, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minghella took the central focus away from Hana and Kip and put it on the Patient and Katherine Clifton, thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the &#34;essence&#34; of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas put in unengaging, uninspiring, uninvolving, unemotional performances that were obviously intended to convey a great, driving, passionate love-affair to the viewer, but which in fact delivered only an inexplicable, perfunctory liaison between two flat, shallow, uninteresting adulterers. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unexciting, and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by Minghella&#39;s grandiose and overblown presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;grand, sweeping, David-Lean-like&#34; qualities to which the many undiscriminating reviewers of this goofy film love to refer simply is not there. The comparison to David Lean (&#34;Dr. Zhivago&#34;) is positively insulting to yet another great director. Take, for example, the &#34;Patient&#39;s&#34; sandstorm scene, which is no doubt one wherein these &#34;grand, sweeping&#34; qualities are believed to have resided (or should have resided): the sandstorm is not grand -- it is not even convincing. The subsequent burying of the characters in the automobile and their emergence after the storm, which no doubt was supposed to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally, completely lacked either drama or emotion --in fact, because it was so patently weak, it had an air of comedy about it where comedy was clearly out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film failed. It failed as a rendering of the novel, and it failed as a film. It seems to have been the &#34;anointed Oscar vehicle&#34; of the year (joining such over-trumpeted filmic slosh as &#34;Kramer vs. Kramer&#34; or &#34;Terms of Endearment&#34;). One can only thank God that even the hype-driven Acadamy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;had the good sense to present the Best Actress award to Frances McDormand for her truly deserving performance in the truly excellent film, &#34;Fargo.&#34; There was not a single performance in the execrable &#34;English Patient&#34; that was not either embarrassingly horrid over-acting (Willem Dafoe) or truly forgettable, mediocre acting (Fiennes and Scott Thomas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why this non-entity of a film retains a coven of fanatical (and clearly tasteless) devotees will remain a mystery. Fortunately, the sands of time will bury this mediocrity of a film permanently, and it will not, thankfully, have the strength ever to dig itself out.

Good old Jess Franco! The always-reliable choice of director in case you&#39;re looking for undemanding sleaze, shameless exploitation and 200% gratuitousness. Jess once again really surpassed himself with this utterly trashy piece of jungle &#34;adventure&#34;. Let&#39;s face it, this film is basically just an excuse to have the ravishingly hot (and underage) actress Katja Bienert parade around topless. It&#39;s actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk around a film set naked in front of a whole crew and particularly before the gazing eyes of pervert Franco! And it wasn&#39;t even the first time, since the duo previously already made &#34;Linda&#34; together. Anyways, just in case you wondered: YES, &#34;Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro&#34; does have a plot, albeit a very imbecilic one. During the opening sequences a plane, carrying aboard a wealthy Scottish guy and a girl child, crash amidst an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals. I say vegetarian because they never at one point in the film so much even attempt to consume human flesh. The obnoxious Scot declares himself the Great White Leader and the girl grows up to become the beautiful and scarcely dressed White Goddess. Several years later an expedition reaches the middle of the jungle to get the girl back to civilization and  even more importantly - to steal some of the tribe&#39;s legendary diamonds. This could have been a compelling and action-packed adventure movie, but Jess Franco obviously couldn&#39;t be bothered. Why shoot jungle chase sequences or bloody cannibalistic rites when you can just as easily aim your camera at a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree? Most of the jungle settings simply appear to be filmed in someone&#39;s garden and there&#39;s a massive amount of clumsily edited National Geographic wildlife footage in order to fill up the gaps in continuity. The back of the DVD describes &#34;Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro&#34; as an ingenious, feminist and adult orientated version of Tarzan. Yeah right, they just put that sentence there because Katja Bienert&#39;s character swings from one tree to another using a a couple of times.

This is one of those road movies that would like to tell you a lotta things about women,the universe,the better life,the terrible solitude of the brilliant architect from Manhattan who severs all links with everyone,including his three years old child -which may seem irresponsible to some-Actually the hero wins hands down when it comes to selfishness and the scene with his old school pal ,which begins as some kind of good old days conversation and ends on a threatening note is the oasis in a desert movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scene with-the-father-who-left-home-when -I-was-a child has been told and told and TOLD.Of course it did not prevent the offspring from making his way of life.And when you see the hero&#39;s wife&#39;s attitude ,you may think she must never have heard about woman&#39;s lib.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best is the soundtrack which includes superb songs by Willie Nelson,Tom Waits or Bonnie Raitt...But you can enjoy them without this tedious pretentious work.

Man oh man! What a piece of crummy film-making! But this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though I hate to admit it. They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the border of Cupertino) we had this thing called The G Channel on our cable system. And they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in lust and love with the young Brooke Shields and loved her dopey adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script makes almost no sense, the direction is poor, the few highlights are that Henry Fonda makes an appearance, a lot of dialog that&#39;s so bad it&#39;s good and a nice Carole King song played over the end credits. Maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick. And hey, everybody knows there ain&#39;t no gold in the Grand Canyon!

With its companion piece MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that began so auspiciously with THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE OUTER LIMITS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, part of the problem is that it does nothing to be of any interest to a comparatively adult audience, instead aiming at TEN-YEAR-OLDS, who are only able to count body-bags, and scarcely that. And so grossness is king, and King is grossness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen King is simply illiterate  in general he has the aptitude for storytelling of Bart Simpson. Since he cannot read his sole inspiration is the movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, the cinema is not such a bad place to start, since it has generally escaped the onslaught of &#34;Realism&#34;. But these films are only the rumor, not the thing, and if you want to WRITE, you have to dig deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, only PICKMAN had monsters as close acquaintances. But even so, it should be clear to any undergraduate that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR is a clear indication of what is wrong. One can almost imagine this pathetic dolt sitting as his desk trying to come up with something SCARY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not, mind you, trying to describe accurately the horror of the system of which he is an integral part, making the stupid stupider, but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew. Suppose, you were paralyzed, and people thought you were dead and started to cut you open like they do at those autopsy things! Wouldn&#39;t that be gross? And that, boys and girls, is the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about characterization? Oh yes, he&#39;s one of these suits, who never really appreciated life, you know, and now it&#39;s too late, right? And he&#39;s shouting  well, they can&#39;t actually hear him, you know  he&#39;s saying that he&#39;s going to sue the hospital, but he&#39;s not such a big shot anymore, you see, lying there (or is it laying, I can never remember) and all. And he&#39;s thinking: Oh no please, please don&#39;t cut me and this is terrible, lying (or laying) like that  now, wouldn&#39;t that be a great story? You know I read somewhere that a snake bite can do that, I think it was that great medical authority Agatha Christie. What was the name of that snake again, oh yeah, a BOOMSLANG  has quite a ring to it, doesn&#39;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s make it a PERUVIAN BOOMSLANG! Sure, Steve, that&#39;s great  except that BOOMSLANG is Afrikaans, you moron! But how can you really tell that the target audience is children, and not simply mental defects? It&#39;s easy: There&#39;s no sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, there is, but it&#39;s the kind glimpsed through a crack in the door to our parent&#39;s bedroom. Modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the chase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON they have no idea what&#39;s going on. All that&#39;s really left is the giggling outside the SM club and the Fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of a certain discrepancy in size, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay Wray. Freddy Krueger can only kill her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since there&#39;s no real titillation in that, he has to torture her first  not in any way that might excite her, you understand, since that would upset our puritan sentiments. And so, horror and romanticism become simply unpleasantness and the grooming of psychopaths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our hero, you see, is a rubber fetishist, and can only get a boner if someone touches him you know down there with you know  rubber gloves (giggle). And that&#39;s what they use in autopsies, and that&#39;s how they discover that he is, in fact, you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this is the author at the height of his inspirational powers. Too bad, they cut it out, since it might have upset the FIVE-YEAR-OLDS watching the show!

....but at the same time part of you is thinking &#34;Am I ready for what I am about to see?&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, you are happy you saw it. I was, at least. Jackass Number Two has twice the laughs and twice the action. Some stunts will leave you breathless. Besides Little Miss Sunshine, I think it was the best movie I saw this summer. Maybe even this year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire cast returns, besides a few such as Chris Raab and Rake Yohn. I don&#39;t think any of the cast members had a dull moment. Each and every stunt was either funny or dangerous or a combination of both; stupid. The beginning was just as funny as the first one, and the ending was interestingly hilarious; the cast performing a musical number. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackass Number Two is the perfect movie to see with your friends. Stay during the credits, there are some pretty funny moments. One involves Luke Wilson.

This movie was recommended to me by several people, and after reading all the positive comments from this site I went ahead and bought a copy of the film off ebay. The acting in the film is average and a bit hammy, especially by the family of cannibals, one sequence comes to mind when Jupiter is ranting and raving to the burnt corpse, speaking right into the camera. Its one of those performances where you just cringe and feel bad for that poor actor. Its also evidence of some of the worst editing I&#39;ve seen, theres a terrible jump cut right in the middle of his &#34;speech&#34;. There are a few creepy moments though, and at times the music works well...but overall the film isnt that great and I dont know why people think Wes Craven is that great of a director. Thus far he hasn&#39;t showed me anything that I believe to be brilliant, the only thing that improved with Cravens films, production to prodution was his budget.

A response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed: One person suggested that the closing and destruction of the Ocean View Amusement Park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods. This is simply not true. Prior to the construction of Interstate 64, which bypasses the Ocean View area, the primary route for traffic went through the heart of Ocean View. Once the interstate was completed, Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. This led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park, which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg. Meanwhile, in the past few years, the City of Norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought-after location for construction of high-end housing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film &#34;Rollercoaster&#34;. This is also untrue. Footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film, but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to &#34;Death of Ocean View Park&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the film itself, the storyline of a &#34;supernatural&#34; force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly, but somewhat typical for B-grade movies of the time. With the cast involved, there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors. I don&#39;t believe this film was intended to be another &#34;Citizen Kane&#34;; I believe Playboy was experimenting with a new non-nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into (apparently not!). A strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table, but proved unmanageable in execution. The roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway; &#34;let&#39;s come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise!&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the casual movie viewer, this would be a &#34;see once and forget about it&#34; film (except for Diana Canova fans); but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park, this movie is like a &#34;walk down memory lane&#34; for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown Norfolk, the first &#34;Harborfest&#34;, and Old Dominion University. Even a limited release of this film on DVD would be welcome.

Josie is a reporter from a newspaper is set a task to go back to high school as she is going to be 17 again. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she is there, she remembers some really awful stuff thats happened to her the first time she was in Highschool as we see in flashback scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the flashback they show that (little spoiler) Josie was kind of a nerd in high school and was picked on a lot and one day the cool guy tells her that he is taking her to the prom, only on the prom night as she leaves her house she gets egged by the ass hole and his bitch. what a horrible thing to do (some will find this hard to watch as it so nasty and it will make you feel warmer to Josie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find this movie that funny but there was some really funny stuff in the office scenes a lot more funnier then anything that happened in the school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie did have the perfect happy ending, as it did bring tears to my mum and sister eyes. The acting in this movie was not outstanding, it was good for the most part of the movie, there is some poor acting in some parts of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I going to give this movie 7 out 10.

I have two good things to say about this film: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction). However, that said, I found this film extremely tiresome. Watching paint dry would have been more entertaining. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Beginning with opening sequence, where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything that&#39;s said to him on the phone, the movie is annoying. The film is filled with clichés and shtick, not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by Falk. Also, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears. There are some sequences that are touching, but they&#39;re all played for laughs. If schmaltzy, sentimental, and &#34;cute&#34; appeal to you, you&#39;ll love it. But if you were hoping for something with more substance, see a different movie.

This son of a son of a sequel was terrible to say the least. You would think that production would be better 10 years after the original was released, however Retro Puppet Master was not directed by or written by the original writers and contained poor story, lack of any emmontional connection to any characters, and dragged out slowly scene to scene. No build up of strong plot, very weak climax, you will find yourself slowly getting antsy throughout the movie, if you can sit through the whole reel. I never could understand why a horror movie continues making sequels after the release of their &#34;final chapter.&#34; I hardly suggest watching this flick, but if you must I wouldn&#39;t recommend making anyone else sit through it with you.

Just saw a pre-screening tonight. What can I say? It lived up to it&#39;s mediocre trailer run, though that&#39;s saying nothing at all. It did absolutely nothing that any movie before it hasn&#39;t done, and it played out in such a cliché fashion that eventually I got to the point where I stopped laughing only because I was laughing with the audience, and instead let the humorless movie play out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#39;s see... we have the less-than-spectacular main character that is trying to get back with his ex-girlfriend but he&#39;s not good enough for her, check. We have the three buddies that all have their own &#34;personality&#34; with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character&#39;s best friend but is constantly rejected, another friend being the super awkward one that can&#39;t live down seeing the positive in everything 24/7 and is thrown in for the one-liners (which in this case is just a bunch of movie references, specifically from Disney), and the third guy whose name you won&#39;t ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen... check. We have the girl&#39;s ex-boyfriend and her parents ****-block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up, not to mention the awkward family members from the main character&#39;s side... check. We have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed, check. We have the movie&#39;s &#34;funny&#34; moments come from incessant swearing, people falling down or being hit, scenes from the trailer, and homosexual innuendos... check. And dare I call it a spoiler, but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie... check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this could have... no, wait... should have been a PG-13 movie. All that needed to be dropped were any F-bombs. Honestly, it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor, would have gotten less media exposure, and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent R-rated comedies like Superbad and Knocked Up. The humor in this movie is just so awkward that it doesn&#39;t fit in with what general people look for. I bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera. Let&#39;s put it this way... in the theater, it will help you laugh because it&#39;s on the big screen and others are laughing. When this movie hits Showtime and you&#39;re checking it out at 2:00 PM on an off-day, you may be inclined to change the channel. The only thing that will keep you watching is Alice Eve&#39;s hotness (who is not quite a 10, but still very good looking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the main resolution, this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie, where everything else pretty much flies out the window. So there is a main resolution, but what comes of it? It&#39;s never really clear-cut, nor does it allow the ending to be &#34;feel-good&#34; with the abruptness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was only one thing worth nothing in this movie, and that was the good soundtrack. Aside from the nice choice of 90&#39;s alternative rock songs, there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie (more so the beginning of it) that reminds me of something David Holmes would mix up/compose. I&#39;ll give them props for a great choice of sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer, because the inadvertent yet proud Pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that Rock Band promotion. I just figured a lot of Rock Band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it. But I say hold onto your money. If this was PG-13 and you were 15 years old on a Friday night with a group of friends, I&#39;d say knock yourselves out. Otherwise, definitely pass. It doesn&#39;t try and compete with the R-rated movies of the past few years, and ideally it definitely isn&#39;t as good.

I read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly. I have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful. It pains me to write that since I would have hoped this would have been great, or I wouldn&#39;t have bothered to see it the other day. I like supporting indie cinema, especially if they are gay-themed, but this movie is almost too much to tolerate. Those that walked out, as I considered doing after about three minutes, probably didn&#39;t mind shelling out $11.00, or just figured it was going nowhere, fast, and not going to improve. Maybe I am slightly more optimistic than they are..either that or they didn&#39;t pay to get in in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logan is bored. He&#39;s a klutz. He&#39;s gay. I&#39;m okay with that. The problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also! There are ENDLESS scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry, re-establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc., etc...Nothing or no one goes anywhere. NO ONE says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting. Probably most appalling of all is that I didn&#39;t feel the slightest bit of empathy for Logan. That in itself is a major accomplishment. He didn&#39;t grow, he didn&#39;t change, he didn&#39;t learn (there is no one to teach him anything), he DIDN&#39;T DO ANYTHING, and neither did the movie! Scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the title makes no sense at all. 1/10.

I could not, for the life of me, follow, figure out or understand the story. As the plot advances it too stays incomprehensible. I&#39;m going to guess and say that there was a preproduction story/plot problem that never got sorted out. The producers could never separate the many details that the novel, or any novel, has the time and space to create from the other idea, which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the killer&#39;s pursuit by the police. They ended up with too many things happening in a proscribed feature film time limit. Too bad really because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography. In fact, a well made movie that one could enjoy and relax with for a couple of hours.

Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the 4th movie of the Dirty Harry series. Clint is older but he&#39;s still got it, Harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery (where the memorable &#34;Make My Day&#34; catchphrase comes from!) But the city he took a vacation was worse, a woman turned vigilante after a rape attack in a funfair and starts getting the punks one by one. The last movie to see Sandra Locke in a Clint Eastwood movie! An improvement after The Enforcer which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious. Clint Eastwood&#39;s sunglasses were Gargoyles which are best known for the sunglasses that are worn by Arnold Shwartzeneger in The Terminator. Worth a watch if you like Clint Eastwood, the Dirty Harry films or like action crime thrillers.

I had looked forward to viewing this movie, it seemed anyone who had seen it loved it. I was completely disappointed. The acting was so overdone. The script seemed like the writer had gathered 25 different scripts from various movies and randomly chose dialogue and pieced them together to form one plagarized script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoilers: Was any cliche omitted in this movie? There was a mobstyle hit, homosexuality, prostitution, a serial killer, a fire, numerous godfather wannabees, the main character in love with the prostitute, cross dressing, torture by the police, Hannibal Lechter style mutilations, I could go on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Line&#39;s like (the godfather wannabe to the prostitute)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&#34;Ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum&#34; (I don&#39;t want u to work anymore)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&#34;Ben calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek?&#34; (Who would pay the rent if I didn&#39;t work)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unrealistic scenes: We never saw a single policeman during the serial killer scenes, yet when the main character disappeared his father was taken in by the police and tortured for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way I can make sense out of this whole movie, is if the version I had scene was severely edited from the original. I definitely do not recommend it, and would greatly enjoy discussing it further with anyone who would care to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO type channels. I missed the beginning but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you get the chance take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think about having the cable company take off my Movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them. Happy Holidays to all from Cape Cod !!!

This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee film I&#39;ve seen. I say pretty much, because I have also seen Soldier, in which he plays the villain... but from what I&#39;ve heard, it&#39;s not considered a Jason Scott Lee film. This, however, is. And if this is any indication of the quality of such films, I won&#39;t be seeing any of the others. Lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist... as the lead, he&#39;s awful. He gets in a fight with random no-name characters every few minutes of the film, probably because the script writer couldn&#39;t figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film. The villain is the only character with even a hint of personality, and aside from the fact that he&#39;s certifiably insane, he barely seems like a villain at all. The majority of the film is basically Lee chasing the villain through time... or maybe it&#39;s the other way around. I can&#39;t say for sure... and I definitely wouldn&#39;t watch it again to make sure. The effects are not completely horrible... but it&#39;s close. The title comes from the popular idea of using a time-machine to go and kill Hitler. Somehow, the film screws up that interesting idea as well. The plot is too complicated for its own good. The pacing is poor. I can&#39;t think of one positive thing to say about this film... I really can&#39;t. It&#39;s simply too formulaic and pointless. If only I had a time-machine, so I could go back and prevent this film from ever being made... no, never mind. I just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible. Listen to the negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to fans of Lee, and no one else. If you&#39;re looking for a quality film... well, this isn&#39;t it. That&#39;s for sure. 1/10

The 3rd and in my view the best of the Blackadder series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that there is no Lord Percy who was the funniest character from the previous series but Hugh Laurie&#39;s Prince Regent is suitably madcap laugh a line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a package it&#39;s quality through and through with convincing regency sets, superb cutting sarcasm and little bits of the wacky, the &#39;macbeth&#39; actors standing out and Prince Georges &#39;lucky us&#39; chicken impression, and the missing words from Dr Johnson&#39;s dictionary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few comedies have been quite as both clever as they are funny, okay the odd lame observation or line gets in but mostly it&#39;s a scream.

When moviegoers hear two popular villains/characters will be fighting, they flock to the theaters to see how the battle will end. There&#39;s Freddy vs. Jason, in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other. And, more similarly to this, there&#39;s Godzilla vs. (Insert Name Here). But the very generic Komodo vs. Python is just a horrible title, and an even worse premise. Obviously, the movie&#39;s a D-list picture, but, at least come up with a more compelling name, maybe something that can trick the unsuspecting viewer into watching it. With a name like this, you know what you&#39;re getting in to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A group of military men/women, including a 20-something year old sexy scientist woman are left for dead by the military on an island inhabited by a giant komodo dragon. As long as they can make it off the island and to the boat, they&#39;ll be fine, but...no...there&#39;s a giant python guarding the ocean and the way off. Let&#39;s hope all these guys can make it off the island, and that the python and komodo don&#39;t verse each other in some sort of horrible special effect battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, this movie is bad in almost every way. The acting is pretty bad, or maybe it&#39;s that the special effects are so cheesy, that the acting is unbelievable because no one believes that these people are in any danger with creatures that look like they were made on an early 90s computer. Nonetheless, this movie is actually pretty funny. The creatures are so clunky looking, and the actors really give it their all pretending like they&#39;re in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d like to say that this movie is a steaming pile of sh*squawk!*...but I can&#39;t. This PG-13 rated film actually bleeps itself out. Every time a curse word comes, a parrot noise beeps out the word. Even words that can be said on network television. How *squawk*ing cheap that they bleep out words, and with a parrot no less. Eventually these parrot noises got to me and I couldn&#39;t help but laugh at the incompetence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is bad, from the silly beginning to the ridiculous Night of the Living Dead style ending, but it&#39;s also kind of funny. As a horror movie it fails miserably, as an action movie, it fails slightly less, but still pretty bad, and as a comedy it shines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating: * out of ****. 95 mins. PG-13 for some violence and Squawked out cursing.

Watching this movie really surprised me. I have never found myself to stop watching a movie in its entirety because 3 dollars to rent a movie is a good amount of money and darn it, I should at least watch the whole thing and get my moneys worth. I made it through about 30 minutes of this absolutely crappy movie when I thought to myself, I am now a little more dumber after watching this movie. I can&#39;t believe that the director and actors in this movie actually had that low of respect for themselves to allow this to be released! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s nothing I can say that hasn&#39;t been said by the other reviewers, but even in the worst of films there are usually one or two decent performances...not in this piece of pathetic garbage. I&#39;ve seen better acting in high school plays. Every, and I mean every &#39;actor&#39; is bad beyond belief, and what&#39;s truly amazing is the uniformity of the badness...gosh, it must have been the director. Where did they get these people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is possibly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. Although entertaining in places due to its laughable script and even weaker acting, and I use that term very loosely, it is unfortunate that this film was not consigned to B movie hell for all eternity. What could have been a good idea has been ruined by an ultra low budget, poor sound and effects and actors who probably earned their wings in children&#39;s television, and poor children&#39;s television at that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, STAY AWAY from this movie. Not even worth a minute of your time.

Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy had extensive (separate) film careers before they were eventually teamed. For many of Ollie&#39;s pre-Stan films, he was billed on screen as Babe Hardy ... and throughout his adult life, Hardy was known to his friends as &#39;Babe&#39;. While touring postwar Britain with Laurel in a music-hall act for Bernard Delfont, Hardy gave an interview to journalist John McCabe in which he explained the origin of this nickname: early in his acting career, Hardy got a shave from a gay hairdresser who squeezed Hardy&#39;s plump cheeks (the ones on his face) and said &#39;Nice baby!&#39; Hardy&#39;s workmates started crying him &#39;Babe&#39;, and the nickname stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although much of Hardy&#39;s pre-Laurel work is very interesting -- notably his comedy roles in support of Larry Semon and the Chaplin imitator Billy West -- his teamwork with Billy Ruge (who?) in a series of low-budget shorts for the Vim Comedy Film Company is very dire indeed. Hardy and Ruge were given the screen names Plump and Runt: names which are unpleasant in their own right, but made worse because Ruge (although shorter than Hardy) isn&#39;t especially a runt. Seen here, Hardy looks much as he does in his early Hal Roach films with Laurel ... but without the spit curls and the fastidious little moustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;One Too Many&#39;, an absolutely typical Plunt and Runt epic, is direly unfunny ... and its dreichness is made even more conspicuous by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as &#39;That&#39;s My Wife&#39;, one of Laurel and Hardy&#39;s most hilarious films. Plump (Hardy) is the star boarder in a rooming-house run by a tall gawky landlady. Runt (Ruge) is the porter. Plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle John, whose dosh he expects to inherit. His uncle is coming to see him and to meet Plump&#39;s wife and baby. There&#39;s only one problem: Plump hasn&#39;t got a wife and baby. He&#39;s been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man. Now, of course, Plump expects Runt to find him a wife and baby on short notice. Of course, the results are disastrous. It would be nice if those disastrous results were funny, but they aren&#39;t. Most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick, with characters settling their arguments by shoving each other into bathtubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILERS COMING. Vim director Will Louis (who?) shows no instinct for camera framing: the actress who plays the landlady is significantly taller than Hardy, and Louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame. This could be funny if done on purpose, but it&#39;s merely inept. At one point in this bad comedy, an extremely tasteless gag is looming on the horizon as Runt approaches a black laundress. &#39;Surely they wouldn&#39;t stoop THAT low for a laugh,&#39; I thought. But they do. Runt steals the woman&#39;s black infant and tries to fob this off as Plump&#39;s progeny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, Plump acquires an infant&#39;s cot, but he still hasn&#39;t got a baby. With Uncle John coming up the stairs, Plump conscripts Runt for babyhood. This gag might just possibly have worked with a midget, or even with a truly runt-sized actor such as Chester Conklin, but Billy Ruge is only slightly below average height. Ruge&#39;s impersonation of a baby is neither believable nor funny, and Uncle John would have to be a complete moron to fall for it. Amazingly, he does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most notable aspect of &#39;One Too Many&#39; is a brief appearance -- apparently her only-ever film appearance -- by Madelyn Saloshin, Oliver Hardy&#39;s first wife. The marriage was not a happy one, although Hardy&#39;s marital troubles never attained the epic proportions of Stan Laurel&#39;s. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing in this movie impressed me. There is a very brief flashback sequence, with Hardy reminiscing about his seaside romance with a bathing beauty. In 1916, there was still not yet a standard film grammar for conveying flashbacks: the one shown here is done gracefully and simply. Too bad this movie has no other merits. &#39;One Too Many&#39; is definitely one film too many on Oliver Hardy&#39;s CV, and I&#39;ll rate this movie just one point out of 10. Laurel and Hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them separately.

Another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story. Within 15 minutes, the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines, so there is absolutely no mystery, which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense. The only half-way competent actor is killed 10 minutes into the film, so we&#39;re left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things. Low budget films can&#39;t afford expensive special effects, so the CGI portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive, but were at least a valid attempt. The creature suit is terrible, as seen when it falls to the sidewalk, and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes, which aren&#39;t even the red color shown in mirror shots. The dialogue is clumsy and uninspired, with some lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator. The last action sequence takes place in a police station, also a rip-off from Terminator, with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the Darkwolf doesn&#39;t smash into. In the end, the girl calls the hero &#34;a good Protector&#34;, but he gets both his partners, the original Protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen cops, all killed without getting a decent shot off, in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun. But here&#39;s the real clincher for bad writing: They could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes. Instead, they took it into custody?!?

I am starting this review with a big giant spoiler about this film. Do not read further...here it comes, avert your eyes! The main heroine, the girl who always survives in other slasher films, is murdered here. There, I just saved you 79 minutes of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the &#39;80&#39;s. Despite killing the heroine off, this is just substandard junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both priests and college students get a bad rap here. They are pictured as oversexed, sociopathic morons who have way too many internal problems to deal with what looks like junior college campus life...and the college students come off even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Splatter University&#34; is just gunk to put in your VCR when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest watching your head cleaner tape, that would be more entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gore, profanity, very brief female nudity, and sexual references.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This is one of the best horror / suspense films that Hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades.Even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts, it has everything that a good film in this genre should had CHILL, THRILLS, AND yes a lot of GORE!! HOUSE OF WAX SURE DELIVERS!!! In parts it was sort of far-fetched,the acting was not that great,but my overhaul rating for HOUSE OF WAX is an eight out of ten......if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats, this is just the right movie for you,I have to admit,it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax...... I myself enjoy these museums, but after seeing this film I will now look at them in a whole new different way!

Ego. Seems it&#39;s the only reason this movie was made. This movie is so wrong in so many ways that it&#39;s below one&#39;s dignity to write much about it. Every character was only good at self praise and lead actors (i use this term liberally as has the director) emote in the likeness of stone. the little story, if that, fails on the basic aspects such as logic, feeling and drama. Direction leaves much to be desired. blatant flaws are all over the place (character motives aren&#39;t defined, prospective husbands are found overnight, broken car windows mend themselves among other things)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s face it, Himesh can&#39;t act. neither, it seems, can Hansika Motwani. In her defense, she&#39;s still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of make-up. Raj Babbar Overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible. Darshan Jariwala laughs a bit too much. The actor who plays Himesh&#39;s friend is the only natural. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a few questions do come to mind: how can such a film cost Rs.500,000,000?? where did the money go??? granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and Mallika Sherawat was paid an obscene Rs.15,000,000 for her 15 minute appearance and 2 songs. but the sheer stupidity of the film boggles the mind. (including 3 Mumbai auto rickshaws that show up and jump on a police car)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the good: Himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark &#34;topi.&#34; Let&#39;s give the Devil his due: Himesh, as usual gives good music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: Direction, Story, Himesh&#39;s singing is still hard to ignore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly: Dialogs and everything else!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Word: Painful in every sense of the word! watch this movie only if you loved Subhash Ghai&#39;s &#34;Yaadein&#34;

Fans of Gerry Anderson&#39;s productions will recognise several actors and vehicles from UFO (which was made after Doppelgänger) - as well as sound effects from various Anderson series. Barry Gray&#39;s excellent music (mostly unique to this film) adds to the feeling of familiarity. For these reasons alone, I think any Gerry Anderson fan would find Doppelgänger worth getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judged simply as a film, it has to be said that Doppelgänger is flawed. It is known that there were major problems during production, and I suspect this is why there is a time-consuming plot thread that ends abruptly and appears to have no relevance to the rest of the story. Presumably time/budget constraints prevented the relevance from emerging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distractingly, the special effects range from outstandingly good - better than any 1960s film that I know of - to disappointingly bad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, even with these flaws, Doppelgänger&#39;s main story is well told and keeps the viewer (or, at least, this viewer) engaged throughout. The ending is perhaps not what one might expect from Anderson, yet at the same time it is typical of Anderson, and it is certainly appropriate. To find out what I mean you&#39;ll have to watch it for yourself. :)

I watched this movie last night on one of the pay-per-view channels, and while watching it I quickly wondered why I bothered. In all honesty I really did expect something more from this film. Maybe something along the lines of &#39;Conspiracy Theory&#39;. Why? Maybe because of the casting. I mean, Nicolas Cage and Harvey Keitel, after all. Not to mention Jon Voight and Christopher Plummer. Now I&#39;m wondering, why did they bother? But instead of an absorbing action cum mystery drama I was caught up in a pastiche of breakneck silliness a là &#39;The Goonies&#39;, which to my great surprise appears to have garnered some actual critical praise. Perhaps it&#39;s because &#39;The Goonies&#39; was clearly targeted toward the pre-teen and teen audiences. Whereas &#39;National Treasure&#39;, judging from the previews, was seriously intended to appeal to an adult audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suspension of disbelief is one thing. It&#39;s how one can enjoy sci-fi and horror. But I found myself actually resisting the heaping tablespoons of paranoid and conspiracy-laden tripe being shoved at the audience. Oh, the screenwriter threw around all the jargon intended to evoke a sense of serious engaged wonderment. &#34;Wow! The Masons. The Knights Templars. You know, this could really be true!&#34; I think the writer really lost me when Gates said the Founding Fathers hid the treasure to keep it out of the hands of the British! And just were did the Knights Templar come from? New Jersey? Oh, I forget. From France! Which goes a long way to explain how it ended up in Philadelphia during the Revolution. It was brought there by agents of Napoleon! Anyway, you see what I&#39;m getting at. The premise of the movie is interesting. And I really do think it could have succeeded as a serious mystery drama. But it just comes off as another kid flick in grown-up clothing. In the end I think it asks the audience not simply to suspend belief but to render itself willfully ignorant to an insulting degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve just finished watching several items by Werner Herzog and Istvan Szabo. It&#39;s a shock to switch from fine dining to Hollywood Big Mac and fries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, okay. If you pant over chases, explosions, and &#39;gee-whiz&#39; gimmickry you&#39;ll enjoy &#39;National Treasure&#39;. But it&#39;s the sort of movie, well, have you ever stood outside a cinema waiting to get in while the previous audience comes out? And all the young kids are talking excitedly among themselves and saying things like, &#34;Wow! Did you see how that thing blew up? That was so cool!&#34; &#39;National Treasure&#39; is that kind of movie.

It was so terrible. It wasn&#39;t fun to watch at all. Even the scene where the girl is using a vibrator, even that&#39;s not fun to watch in this movie. I say again, the scene where a girl is masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to watch. Or maybe if that was the only part of the movie that you watched, just girl on couch using a vibrator. Maybe they should have just released that one scene in theaters, maybe then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level. My advice, fast forward to that point, watch it, rewind the movie, watch it again, rewind, repeat. Maybe you could enjoy yourself for 2 hours that way. This movie ranks alongside I spit on your grave and Doom generation in the category of worst movies that I have ever seen.

I recently watched this again and there&#39;s another version which is shorter 1999. I get the feeling they are the same movie but I would like to know the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One is Japanese and no pikachu short is all I can come up with. Ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice?? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prof Ivy was rather boring. She sounded as if she was almost asleep, no expression at all with the few lines she had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was enjoyable enough but there wasn&#39;t much to it at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A collector (whos after Lugia, he has no plan to destroy the world) and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture Lugia causes a lot of destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pokemon movies that follow are slightly better, deoxys (poke 7) is great, with no. 8 almost here.

Picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyper-stylized black and white visuals of Frank Miller&#39;s Sin City. Then picture a dystopian, science fiction thriller, such as Steven Spielberg&#39;s Minority Report or Richard Linklater&#39;s A Scanner Darkly. An amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director Christian Volckman&#39;s bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut. But although Volckman&#39;s work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them, such a simplistic hybrid does not do Renaissance, Volckman&#39;s end result, justice - the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair, especially in a contemporary context, with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted. As such, Renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least, with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo-noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci-fi drama, which serve to compliment each other&#39;s storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion. The screenplay is a clever and intriguing one (although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the English translation - the film&#39;s title also becomes far more poignant) managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through. Though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers, the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes, making for a truly compelling work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volckman&#39;s film truly excels in its visual component, and the stunning black and white animation is easily the film&#39;s highlight - superbly moody and stylish, it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have. With tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot, and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene, the film appears straight out of a Frank Miller comic, but with a twist, the end result being consistently visually sumptuous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film&#39;s English rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting. The gruff voice of Daniel Craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim, stoic policeman Karas, and Catherine McCormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sister&#39;s disappearance he is investigating. Despite a wavering English accent, Romola Garai does great work as the frantic sister in question, and Jonathan Pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega-corporation Avalon. Ian Holm&#39;s reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist, and Holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All together, Renaissance boasts a visually stunning, unique and compelling futuristic thriller, just as intelligent as it is entertaining. Though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be, the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms. For fans of either of the film&#39;s intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of Frank Miller, or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted, slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller, the film is without question worth a watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-8/10

This is one of three 80&#39;s movies that I can think of that were sadly overlooked at the time and unfortunately, still overlooked. One of the others was Clownhouse directed by Victor Salva, a movie horribly overlook due to Salva&#39;s legal/sexual problems. Another would be Cameron&#39;s Closet which strikes me as somewhat underrated--not great, but not nearly as bad as the reviews I&#39;ve seen. Paper House is well worth your time and I think that it is one of those very quiet films that will just stick in your brain for far longer than you might think. I mean, 10 years after I&#39;ve seen it and I still give it some pause, whereas something that I might have seen 6 months ago has gone into the ether.

Think of this pilot as &#34;Hawaii Five-O Lite&#34;. It&#39;s set in Hawaii, it&#39;s an action/adventure crime drama, lots of scenes feature boats and palm trees and polyester fabrics and garish shirts...it even stars the character actor &#34;Zulu&#34; in a supporting role. Oh, there are some minor differences - Roy Thinnes is supposed to be some front-line undercover agent, and the supporting cast is much smaller (and less interesting), but basically the atmosphere is still the same. Problem is, &#34;Hawaii Five-O&#34; (another QM product) already existed at the time and had run for years. It filled the market demand for Hawaii-based crime dramas quite adequately. Code Name: Diamond Head may have been intended as the hier to H50 as the older series eventually dwindled away...but it comes across as a superfluous, 2nd rate copy. It doesn&#39;t suck, but it&#39;s completely derivative and doesn&#39;t do anything as well as the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some decent acting talent involved here. Thinnes is an old pro, and he gives the role his best shot, and he isn&#39;t bad. But Thinnes is only as good as his material and his director. Ian McShane is in here as an evil spy master named &#34;Tree&#34;, and McShane tends to be the most interesting actor in any scene he appears in. But he&#39;s phoning his part in here. Frances Ngyuen is reasonably exotic looking, but her astounding skinniness, opaque features, thick accent and wooden delivery aren&#39;t the stuff of which dreams are made. Relying on her to supply the &#39;romantic interest&#39; for Thinnes was probably the series&#39; biggest mistake. At least for for a series aimed at white audiences brought up with Marsha Brady and Peggy Lee as our love goddesses. Give her another 30 lbs and a year with a dialog/voice coach, and she might cut it. Zulu is, well, his usual self - enjoyable in bit parts, but he isn&#39;t a person who can carry a feature by himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the plot and dialog are strictly by-the-numbers, with nothing to distinguish them from any other Quinn Martin production. And by this point, the American TV audience had seen a whoooole lot of QM productions....I think &#34;CN: DH&#34; was one too many, and it sank without a trace. It wasn&#39;t the really the actors&#39; fault, and I hope they walked away from this with a decent paycheck and one more entry on their C.V.s. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MST3000 revived this for their treatment in their sixth season, and they had a lot of good natured fun with it. Worth seeking out in that version if you enjoy the MST approach to movie japery and lampoon, but I can&#39;t imagine anyone caring about this pilot for any other reason.

I tend to like character-driven films. I also think Hope Davis turns in consistently good work, so I had high hopes for this movie. Those hopes were soon dashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main flaw with this movie is the direction. There are a lot of scenes that are daydream sequences. The movie makes frequent use of the Denis Leary character as the alter ego of the Campbell Scott character. It doesn&#39;t work for me at all. This would have worked better as a play than a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are problems with the plot as well. It is important that the characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place different from where they started. I didn&#39;t feel that the characters grew in the experiences portrayed in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the editing wasn&#39;t well done, either. There was a very big sag in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for acting, which I felt was consistently strong, this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema.

THE IMMORTALIZER was, uh, interesting. It certainly didn&#39;t kill me during its hour and a half duration, but it didn&#39;t impress me much either. A group of kids are abducted in an alley by musclehead mutants (in a scene featuring cinema&#39;s least convincing head crushing sound effect) and taken to a fancy house in the suburbs. Here Dr. Divine and his team are performing brain transplants for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again. Hey, this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplant an old person&#39;s brain into a different body that their new voice will sound exactly like their old voice? With all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum, you can almost see visions of FROM BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing in the producers&#39; heads. But the production literally doesn&#39;t have the guts to pull it off. I&#39;ve never understood why, when someone is making a low budget horror film, that they don&#39;t pack it to the edge of the frame with gore. The acting is uniformly terrible, with the only good performance coming from Clarke Lindsley as the assistant Dr. Price. He has a nice evil laugh. The only other thing of note about THE IMMORTALIZER is that it features lots of old people doing their own stunts. Seriously, most of the cast takes some serious bumps for old folks.

This movie had the potential to be really good, considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci-fi actioner THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles. But someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dolph plays a butt-kicking monk (!) who travels to New York to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years. He must battle the minion, who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like THE HIDDEN and JASON GOES TO HELL. The minion, naturally, wants the key so it can let the antichrist out. Along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and Dolph are chased by the minion-possessed bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#39;m making this sound entertaining, forget it. The pacing is very awkward and sluggish, the acting subpar at best, and the fight scenes staged poorly. Dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine-gun wielding monks at the monastery, but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, I really wanted to like this.

Movie had some good acting and good moments (though obviously pretty low budget), but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed. The main point of conflict between the two leads doesn&#39;t play out in a realistic manner at all. There are a few scenes where they disagree because of it, but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently, especially since the employment of Glenn is so wound up in this part of his life (and Adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money.) Also, several times Glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is (apologizing to Adam for his past) while Adam is shown to be upstanding and &#34;traditional,&#34; which the film proclaims to be the &#34;good&#34; way in the end. I don&#39;t like being preached to like that. I attended a discussion session with the director after viewing LTR, and he said that he presented this conflict between them because, if he was in Glenn&#39;s shoes (and he said he does in real life relate to Glenn&#39;s view) that he could never date someone with Adam&#39;s views. Well, then, I think he should have done a much better job explaining how Glenn could do it in the film. Also, director said he directed this, his first movie, only after reading (Directing For Dummies.) Directing was not that bad, but far from a top notch effort. I&#39;ve seen worse, but I rarely leave films feeling this frustrated.

Story says that on that on December 28, 1895, a small group of thirty-three people was gathered at Paris&#39;s Salon Indien Du Grand Café to witness the Cinématographe, a supposedly new invention that resulted from the work done by a couple of photographers named August and Louis Lumière. The small audience reunited that day (some by invitation, most due to curiosity) didn&#39;t really know what to expect from the show, and when a stationary photograph appeared projected on a screen, most thought that the Cinématographe was just another fancy devise to present slide-show projections. Until the photograph started to move. What those thirty-three people experienced in awe that cold day of December was the very first public screening of a moving picture being projected on a screen; history was being written and cinema as we know it was born that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 10 short movies that were shown during that historic day, &#34;La Sortie Des Usines Lumière&#34; (literally &#34;Exiting the Lumière Factory&#34;) was the very first to be screened. The film shows the many workers of the Lumière factory as they walk through the gates of the factory, leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work. While a very basic &#34;actuality film&#34; (movie depicting a real event), the movie took everyone in the audience by surprise, as their concept of moving pictures was limited to Edison&#39;s &#34;Peep Show&#34; machines (the Kinetoscope), the brothers&#39; invention was like nothing they had seen before and so the audience stood in awe, as the people and the horses moved across the screen. The idea wasn&#39;t entirely new (Le Prince shot the first movie as early as 1888), but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;La Sortie Des Usines Lumière&#34; would become the first in the long series of &#34;actuality films&#34; that the Lumière would produce over the years. This primitive form of documentary was the brothers&#39; favorite kind of film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the uses the Cinématographe could have. Despite the initial lack of enthusiasm, after the first showing the Cinématographe became a great success and &#34;La Sortie Des Usines Lumière&#34; quickly became an iconic image of that first screening. It definitely wasn&#39;t the first movie the brothers shot that year, and it probably wasn&#39;t the best of the 10 movies shown that day (personally I think that &#34;L&#39; Arroseur Arrosé&#34; was the best of the 10); however, it is really meaningful that the very first movie was the opening of a pair of gates, as literally, this movie opened the gates to cinema as we know it. 8/10

How can Barry Levinson possibly assemble white-hot comedy talents Ben Stiller and Jack Black, the gorgeous Rachel Weisz, old pro Christopher Walken and still deliver such a humourless stinker?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stiller and Black are friends until the latter invents a spray to make dog mess vanish and becomes a conspicuous consuming multi-millionaire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The premises is thin but sound enough in the right hands to have been a springboard for some great bitching between the two stars but all concerned overplay every hand, every chance they can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stiller and Black are simply not funny for way too much of the time, Weisz looks sensational as always but is criminally underused and, with the exception of Walken as a batty barfly who urges Stiller&#39;s character to take revenge, it&#39;s a turgid trudge to the end of this strained farce.

THE MATADOR is hit-man movie lite....if you can say that about a hit-man movie. The violence is never really shown but often introduced. At first I was scared I was in for another retread of mid-90s gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy BUT was happily surprised when I realized this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship. Nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning. The three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together. The writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes. This is a good film that I probably won&#39;t remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy. Good film.

I can&#39;t for the life of me remember why--I must have had a free ticket or something--but I saw this movie in the theater when it was released. I don&#39;t remember who I went with, which theater I was in, or even which city. All I remember was how offended I was at this travesty someone dared to call a film, and how half the people in the theater walked out before the movie was over. Unfortunately I stuck it out to end, which I still consider to be one of the worst mistakes of my life thus far. My offense became pure horror when just before the closing credits the smarmy demon child sticks his head out from behind a sign and says &#34;Look for Problem Child 2, coming soon!&#34; That was hands-down THE most terrifying moment ever recorded on film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot, if I recall correctly, involved John Ritter and perhaps his wife (Lord, how I&#39;ve tried without success to block this film out of my mind) adopting a &#34;problem child.&#34; Maybe they think they can reform him, or something. I really don&#39;t know. If that was their intent, they fail miserably because from first frame to last this child remains the brattiest, rudest, most horrid demon-spawn ever to hit the big screen. Forget Damian, forget Rosemary&#39;s Baby. This kid takes the cake. The only difference is, we are supposed to feel sorry for him because he&#39;s a &#34;problem child.&#34; However, this is impossible since this child is quite likely the most unsympathetic character ever portrayed. You want to kill him through the entire film, and when (SPOILER, like anyone cares) John Ritter decides to keep the vile hell-child you will be yelling &#34;Send him back!&#34; in shocked disgust (like several of the people at the theater where I saw it did).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is only the second movie I have given a &#34;1&#34; to on the IMDb. The other was Superman IV, and by God I couldn&#39;t tell you which was worse. John Ritter had a quote in TV Guide about the time that Problem Child 3, which he was not in, came out. He said something like &#34;The only way I would do another [Problem Child] sequel is if they dragged my dead body back to perform.&#34; Amen to that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather watch a 24-hour marathon of Police Academy sequels than see even twenty minutes of Problem Child again. 1/10, only because I can&#39;t give it a negative score, which is what it really deserves. Someone burn the original negatives of this film, please!

&#34;I Am Curious: Yellow&#34; is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn&#39;t matter what one&#39;s political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn&#39;t true. I&#39;ve seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don&#39;t exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we&#39;re treated to the site of Vincent Gallo&#39;s throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) &#34;double-standard&#34; in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won&#39;t see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women&#39;s bodies.

Cave Dwellers, or The Blade Mater, or whatever it&#39;s called, is in one word: VILE! I saw this on MST and I laughed not only at the great running commentary, but at the inept film making that was demonstrated. Sunglasses, tire tracks and where did Ator get a hang glider? Then they lift a few shots from another movie, Where Eagles Dare as Tom Servo points out. To show just how cheap this movie really is, watch the scene where Ator and Thong have to battle invisible swordsmen. Or even better, look for the giant hose dressed up like a snake that Ator must wrestle! And what exactly do those scenes in the credits have to do with the movie?

I don&#39;t care what anyone says, this movie is hilarious! It combines the bleak seriousness of Threads with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy, and the results are a severely dark, but outrageously funny satire on the brinkmanship policies of both the Western and Eastern blocs at the time. You gotta give the filmmakers credit for even attempting to top the real life lunacy of &#34;Duck and cover&#34; or &#34;Protect and survive&#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine someone made a movie based on the Dead Kennedys track &#39;Kinky Sex Makes The World Go Round&#39;, and you&#39;re pretty close to Whoops! Apocalypse. Add Rik Mayall on top form as an insanely OTT SAS commander and you&#39;ve got it exactly. A worthy companion piece to Dr Strangelove, and that&#39;s saying something.

The Late Shift is a great book, I read the book several years ago, and I was transfixed at the cutthroat debauchery that went on when Johnny Carson retired and Jay Leno and Johnny Carson tried to grab his spot. When the movie came out, I snagged a VHS copy of the movie, and having reread the book recently, it&#39;s hard to say which I enjoy more, because they&#39;re quite equal in the amount of information conveyed. The two lead actors, John Michael Higgins, and Daniel Roebuck, two actors I never heard of before, and haven&#39;t heard of since, play Leno and Letterman convincingly, despite Letterman&#39;s dismissal of his portrayal as being poor. They play the parts quite well, despite a lot of people looking for an imitation of the two. I wasn&#39;t as interested in that. The story is what counts. And that brings me to Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates, playing Helen Kushnick, IS this movie. She plays this evil bitch of a character so menacingly you realize how on earth can this woman control herself, much less a national TV show. Yikes! There should be a sequel!!

The two things are are good about this film are it&#39;s two unknown celebrities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in a film, young and supple, with looks that still encompass her body today, steals the very beginning, which is all she is in, and that is that. She is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the score by then known composer Christopher(Chris) Young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star...yeah, I know one star more is not much, but in this movie&#39;s case, it is a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down, getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah...we all know where this is going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.

This is a silly movie with much singing and dancing. Acting is average, but writing leaves something to be desired. There are rememberable performances by Buddy Epsen, with a short but outstanding performance by Gypsy Rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy. A totally unbelievable portrayal of college life which ends with a superb ice skating exibition of Alice in Wonderland. Many parts are worth watching, but do not be afraid to fast forward through parts of the movie

This is one of those feel good, Saturday afternoon movies. It&#39;s right up there with other retro flicks like Flight of the Navigator. Just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up. And it&#39;s fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally really like movies like this from time to time. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a nice story line. And I would have never known Mr. Phoenix had I not recently read the credits. He was just a baby really when he made this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly Preston was quite the young budding actress then too. She and Lea did a wonderful job in this movie. I agree it&#39;s not an Oscar caliber movie. But very much worth watching. Especially if you have kids in the , let&#39;s say, 8 to 11 year old range. Or ones that are interested in the space program.

Great acting, great production values, good direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half. We&#39;re clear on character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conflicts raised are compelling but the follow-through is weak. For instance, we&#39;re very clear that Rudyard Kipling is pro-war but we don&#39;t know if that philosophical stance changes through the course of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the sort of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books. I don&#39;t feel I can rely on the film to get a clear idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The depiction of the war itself is heart-breakingly accurate, though the women&#39;s lack of enthusiasm doesn&#39;t reflect the war hysteria that swept Britain at the time. Perhaps this is historically accurate; like so much in this film, I simply don&#39;t know.

Low-budget murder mystery about a Public Defender trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted of 12 years previously. Complicating things is the fact that he escaped custody after his conviction, but the PD believes the man to be innocent of the murder and works to find the real killer. Gig Young as the PD is okay, and James Anderson as the convicted killer is actually pretty good, but the picture as a whole just rambles along with little suspense, and despite some good character actors in the cast, the performances are generally below par. Director George Archainbaud was apparently more at home making westerns--he was churning out Gene Autry&#39;s TV series at Columbia at around this time--but even if he had tried to inject any liveliness into this picture, the hack script would have defeated his attempts. Average at best, the film climaxes with a courtroom scene that&#39;s straight out of an episode of &#34;Perry Mason&#34; and is just as predictable.

&#34;Destroy All Planets&#34; winds up settling for &#39;destroy all Tokyo&#39; by film&#39;s end, as a space monster resembling a giant squid falls to the reptilian furnace known as Gamera. Actually, Gamera is saving Earth right from the get go, knocking out Varian Space Ship #1 even before the first set of film credits roll. The scene switches to a Japanese scout camp where we meet a pair of meddlesome young heroes, Jim and Masao, who take part in Gamera&#39;s exploits after being kidnapped by the aliens and beamed aboard their ship in an electrified bubble shield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s pretty startling to see the boys convince a scientist to let them operate a newly invented submarine that might be defective. Previously boy genius Masao had wired the unit to run in reverse direction of it&#39;s controls, but Dr. Dobie didn&#39;t think about checking that out as a possibility. At least that prepared the boys for interfering with the alien space ship&#39;s controls by playing switcheroo with a bunch of triangular blocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When boss alien Viras says &#39;Activate the Videotron&#39;, hang on to your seats for rehashed footage from earlier Gamera movies where he battles Barugon and Gyaos. These take up quite a bit of screen time, but are no match for the fast forward button if you want to get on with it. For the longest time Viras addressed an invisible crew, and when they finally appeared, they were Orientals who could fly - imagine that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing as how these movies were made for a juvenile audience, it&#39;s surprising to see how gruesome some of the scenes are. Gamera drawing blood comes to mind, and how about the pair of space crew members being decapitated. When squid tentacles started emerging from the headless bodies I made a connection to the &#39;Alien&#39; films; having the individual units merge to form the giant Viras was a neat device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the appeal for young kids might reside in identifying with the two young heroes who make friends with a giant monster, move around pretty freely on an alien space ship, and get to have whatever they want with the help of alien telepathy technology. Seeing as how the movie was presumably made by adults, it could have been a simple case of wish fulfillment.

This movie fails miserably on every level. I have an idea, let&#39;s take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east. Maybe if we&#39;re lucky they&#39;ll all be shot and killed and we won&#39;t have to ever have our time wasted by them again. Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life? My god, I can&#39;t think of anything I&#39;ve ever seen that was this bad. I&#39;d rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film. If I ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film, I&#39;ll spit in their face and then beat them senseless. That&#39;s my two cents.

Released as KING BOXER in the U.K.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was essentially the FIRST kung fu film to go on general release in the U.K. Many of us had ratcheted through Kurosawa&#39;s astonishingly gritty and involving dramas and were used to oriental film being beautifully shot and lit, with somewhat restrained pacing, all in all like leafing through an album of very fine still photographs that just happened to be moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along come Run Run Shaw and co. with their widescreen &#34;home movie&#34; production values, and astonishing ripe-for-parody dubbing and all the rules have changed. KIng Boxer was the first in through the door, leaving a clearly marked trail for others to follow with their feet planted firmly on top of the blazed footsteps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of hokey plots, pantomime acting, cheesy jump-cuts and spaghetti western style snap-stepped zooms, this film was marvellous. Gorgeous without being opulent and with the most brilliant fight choreography ever to grace a screen. We loved the sickening violence, the anguish, the testosterone. The martial artists among us found some of the techniques fascinating, if flamboyant and oftentimes silly. It was so very different from the Japanese stuff we all knew, and it had lovely acrobatic grace that perfectly complemented the sickening violence and bloodstained floors. Delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;KIng Lear&#34; scene was, at the time, quite a milestone in schlock &#34;You cruel bastards.. My **** !!&#34; Now it&#39;s rather less shocking, but still a bit of a gut-churner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didn&#39;t notice that any females in sight were absolutely one-dimensional. After seeing more films of the genre, it now stands out like a sore thumb, but at the time it didn&#39;t matter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film defined what would rapidly become the kung-fu movie clichés. All of them. Watch it and remember that until this burst onto the western screens, there was no genre for it to slot into. It was unique and awesome. It was the first kung fu movie and it still is, for me and many others, the best.

this could have been better,but it was alright...it helped me get away from my boredom.I didnt even wanna see it,the only reason i wanted to rent it is because Jamie Martz is in it..he is a unknown actor but he is shining and is the highlight of the movie...the ending was so horrible and the acting was good for a b movie...i give it a 4 out of 10

This amazing Oscar winner (4 in total) and John Ford&#39;s first Academy Award winner, is simply spellbinding with a pounding score by Max Steiner. Called an Art film, because Ford had very little money to make this great story about guilt and retribution, and greed and stupidity. But what makes this movie such a classic, is the direction and astounding photography and use of fog and lighting, that was so different from the usual American film, and more in the tradition of German expressionism. And the Oscar winning performance by Victor McLaglen as the drunken Gypo is simply unbelievable. Basically the movie takes place in Ireland, and Gypo turns in a friend in the rebel movement to the English to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend. But having all that money, he starts blowing it on an all night drunk and giving it away, while the leaders of the movement are trying to track down the informer. The whole movie is one night in a dark and foggy Ireland, and a cast of characters that are memorable but all along, the whole world of Gypo is closing in on him, both psychologically. If I had to pick maybe three directors to have ALL their movies on a deserted island forever, and nobody elses, John Ford would certainly be one of them. What a truly remarkable movie...

I love old Burt Reynolds movies. They&#39;re funnier and better than every other movie combined. They might as well have stopped making movies after &#34;Cannonball Run 2&#34;, but I guess how could they have known that there weren&#39;t going to be any more good ones? Man this movie&#39;s good. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the luxuriant Loni Anderson is on hand, looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure loved that advertisement! Plus there&#39;s this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I laughed so hard I almost passed away into the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then never watch another movie again, because I tell you right now: there&#39;s no point.

As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film. The characters have so many complexities, everyone can relate to them in their own way. The brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters, rather than being spoon-fed an opinion. You can love them or dislike them, and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. Wonderful performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life. I&#39;d highly recommend it.

A bus full of passengers is stuck during a snow storm. The police have closed the bridge--saying it&#39;s unsafe and they are stuck in a little café until the road has been cleared. However, after a while, their boredom is turned to concern, as it seems that one of the passengers was NOT originally on the bus and may just be an alien!! This leads to a conclusion that is ironic but also rather funny in a low-brow way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another of the fun episodes of The Twilight Zone. Instead of the typical twists or social commentary, this one features no lasting message. However, it&#39;s also very and watchable, so who cares?! Exactly WHAT occurs you&#39;ll just have to see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this one stars John Hoyt--a face most of you will recognize from countless old TV shows and movies. In almost every case, he played a real grouch (like Charles Lane during the same era), but boy did I love seeing him--as he perfected the grouchy persona and was kind of funny at the same time.

When a small town is threatened by a child killer, a lady police officer goes after him by pretending to be his friend. As she becomes more and more emotionally involved with the murderer her psyche begins to take a beating causing her to lose focus on the job of catching the criminal. Not a film of high voltage excitement, but solid police work and a good depiction of the faulty mind of a psychotic loser.

This line is a good summary of this movie. If you have read it, and watched 20 minutes of the movie, you will know exactly how the rest of the movie is going to behave. Some researcher named Surgei (pronounced SirGay) are searching for hell in the underworld of Moscow. However he seems to have disappeared, and his friend Oven follows with a team to search after him. Could they have find a more boring plot? Some bad actors looking after an old man in the underground. The acting is very bad, the romance really feels pointless and untrue, often there is no good reason for the way the characters are acting, nothing is scary and most of all: there&#39;s not happening anything interesting in the whole, entire movie. They just walk, asking some gang leaders and other guys about the way, walk some more, complain some, finds the old man, and then they run, and finally finds the way out of the underground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that provides me from giving this movie the lowest of all ratings is the atmosphere. If you just want to see a movie for that, this may be a good choice. It&#39;s dark, and it&#39;s mystical and murky. However, the rest of the movie is really dull. You just sit there all the time, waiting for the movie to begin or something to happening. It&#39;s actually happening some things, but they are not very well performed. For example, i didn&#39;t really notice when one of the characters disappeared, and I swear I wasn&#39;t sleeping or something. And I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s dangerous with these children... They just run around in the underground together, scratching it walls with sticks (I suppose it is meant to be scary in some way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just watch this movie if you are in immediate need of some murky atmospheres.

The subject of children being terminally ill is difficult and saddening but &#39;The Cure&#39; successfully portrays the idea that it doesn&#39;t have to be all doom and gloom and, if anything, children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are to find peace before the end. It is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film sees Erik, a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother, moving into a new area where their next-door neighbour is eleven-year-old Dexter, who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion. After his initial fears and ignorance over AIDS are allayed, Erik befriends Dexter and their almost fraternal friendship sees them embark on a journey down the Mississippi to where they have heard about a New Orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The talent from the two young leads of Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello, who play Erik and Dexter respectively, is exceptional. Brad was able to portray Erik&#39;s harder edge without comprising the subtle childish innocence inherent to the character while Joseph depicts the sense of vulnerability to Dexter&#39;s character but injects the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and zeal to highlight that his illness doesn&#39;t mean he still isn&#39;t a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven-year-old boy. The pair&#39;s interactions create a feel in the audience that these are two boys who are genuinely close and they carry the film well. Annabella Sciorra also delivers a touching performance as Dexter&#39;s mother Linda, who adores her son and delights in seeing him thrive with this new friendship to Erik and eventually becomes a surrogate mother-figure to the other boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set against an excellent soundtrack, &#39;The Cure&#39; is a very bittersweet film that manages to flawlessly weave the story of boyhood friendship that survives unflinchingly in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to sappiness or unnecessary saccharine sweet scenes. A very interesting reflection in the film is that is it the adults who have the problem with Dexter&#39;s AIDS status whereas the children, even the &#39;bullies&#39;, come to accept him as they would any other. What is also very touching is how, despite Erik&#39;s streetwise nature, he is the more naive one in his determination to cure Dexter while the younger boy has this haunting sense that he knows his fate but is swept away by his best friend&#39;s enthusiasm for a cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend &#39;The Cure&#39; for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting.

The film starts out great, with a mock instruction film about the habits of Swedish housewives. After that we get a detailed reconstruction of post-war Scandinavia with lots of amazing cars, electronic equipment and interior design; a minimal jazz score, nice cinematography and stylish titling. Also there&#39;s some funny Scandinivian rivalry like in Von Triers &#39;Riget&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, after the set up, &#34;Kitchen stories&#34; collapses like the Twin Towers on 9/11.Actors who try to portray the emotion &#39;jealousy&#34; by just staring in front of them. Corny dialog filled with stale gay symbolism in the vain of: &#34;I don&#39;t like white swans, I prefer bears and wolves... u ever tasted bear meat?&#34; The music becomes cheesier than Yann Tiersen at his worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a pity the director put all the effort in this great set-up, just to screw it up after-wards.

When i first saw the title i was already deducing the theme of the film - it clearly wasn&#39;t a reference to British currency, so it had to be Shakespearian and about pounds of flesh - taking them, or giving them. Will Smith&#39;s a feelgood actor, so serial killers were out. It could only be about a man giving them, so must be about guilt somehow. I spoilt the whole thing for myself by looking it up and knowing the story before i watched, as the beauty of the build-up is the way parts of the main character&#39;s background are drip fed to slowly illuminate the audience as to who he is and why he is doing what he is doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guilt is a very hard subject to do simply because it&#39;s deeply uncomfortable and sad, which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping for a roller-coaster ride - you know its going to be unpleasant. I wouldn&#39;t say the movie glorifies suicide; it delves into the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s also brimming with symbolism everywhere, which is a surefire tell-tale sign that the writing is cleverly thought out in great detail and driving at multiple meanings and a deep reflective nature. The most prominent theme that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically, but was giving it to her physically as the greatest gift he could. Determined to die, but his plan is thwarted by falling in love - what a 2nd act complication. Absolutely masterful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is very slow-paced, but i&#39;m undecided as to whether it would have been better slotted into a smaller timeframe. I didn&#39;t feel the strain and his terrible inner turmoil as much as i could have, but maybe that&#39;s just me having ruined it for myself beforehand. Saying all that though, it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought-provoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get.

Whoever likened this one to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew whereof he spoke. He might, as well, have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. &#34;Kay Hoog&#34; reminds one more than a little of both Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The Shadow, quintessential man of mystery- and the very first &#34;Dark Knight&#34;- was also thought to be one Kent Allard. If one were to take Savage&#39;s first name first and add to it the Kent, you end up with- voila- Clark Kent. Funny, innit?) Like Indiana Jones, Hoog isn&#39;t above pilfering the artifacts of an ancient civilization (though his thefts are often more blatant and less &#34;charmingly roguish&#34; than Jones&#39;s). Unfortunately, this two-parter is a far cry from subsequent serials (from any era) in terms of overall quality. One of the first indications that something is amiss vis a vis the cinematic storytelling is a scene where desperados on horseback, quite literally breathing down his neck, simply watch as Hoog escapes their clutches in a hot air balloon. Why they don&#39;t bother to shoot down the balloon is just one of the many movie-making mysteries that plague these two films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second half of this two-parter is even worse than the first. Granted, this was one of the first ever serials and, as such, should be cut a bit of slack- but there are limits, even, to tolerance. (At one point, the capture of the hero is effected not on screen, but in the narration itself! Talk about cutting corners...) Fritz Lang happens to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever make films; unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did, THE SPIDERS is a bitter pill indeed to swallow...

To be completely honest,I haven&#39;t seen that many western films but I&#39;ve seen enough to know what a good one is.This by far the worst western on the planet today.First off there black people in the wild west? Come on! Who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly, no no, completely retarded!Secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns.Thirdly whats with the Asian chick speaking perfect English? If the setting is western,Asia isn&#39;t where your going. Finally,the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning.Now don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not racist or white either so don&#39;t get ticked after reading this but this movie,this movie is the worst presentation of black people I have ever seen!

This movie is definently a horror movie and if you do not get scared than you must not be watching this movie. It works on the old techniques but throws something new into the mix. This movie grips and runs and hides within your mind. The movie has a point to it unlike other horror movies. Watch it for a thrill and shock to your system.

i love this film. the songs and story lines are great fun. and the song &#34;saying goodbye&#34; always moves me. what a brilliant thing to do to bring puppets to life, in a way that you actually care about these things made of cloth and fabric and whatever. great voices and great talent. why were all the other muppet films that came after this one so much less interesting, moving and funny? is it that mr. henson is just so very missed?

I&#39;m afraid I must disagree with Mr. Radcliffe, as although he is correct in saying this isn&#39;t a comedy, it has many other merits. The plot is a little mad at parts, but I believe it it all fits together nicely, creating a satisfying, enjoyable film. The last scene was rather abysmal compared to the rest of the film, but the actual ending of the plot a few scenes previously is very interesting, showing just what someone will do under stressful circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this film to fans of thrillers and action movies, but if you&#39;re a fan of gangster movies then as long as you don&#39;t expect expect something as deep as Goodfellas then you should still find it enjoyable.

This is a nice movie with good performances by Paz Vega and Leonardo Sbaraglia . Of course Vicente Aranda is a legend in Spanish Cinema and surely one of the great directors in Spanish cinema but I don&#39;t think this is one of his greatest movies even if it&#39;s fine. The screenplay plays with the introduction of Merimeé as a character , it&#39;s a nice touch but it&#39;s unbelievable. The music is composed by Jose Nieto , National Spanish Prize in Cinema. I mean this movie is very good in all the technical aspects .There are very good actors in supporting roles like Antonio Dechent , Maria Botto and others . I give it 7 out of 10 cause I think this could be a better movie but as it is it is not boring at all.

One of the things about the film that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene. I have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing, having tied my own flies, and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spend a day on one river or another seeking to tempt the ever elusive Brown Trout to rise and take the fly that has been offered to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we had occasions like this any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place we were in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the film as the minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauly carried out the ritual. For there is something ritualistic about fly fishing as there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes. You can&#39;t just start casting your fishing line and hope for the best. You have to attune yourself to the place you are in, you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it is flowing and where the best point might be to place your fly and, depending on your skill level, you might even get your fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note of it and strike. The &#39;Art of Fly-fishing&#39; was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title for the film could not be more aptly chosen, for the river did in fact run through the life of father and two sons. This film however spreads itself broader than the family and community in Montana, by the the Blackfoot river, where the film is played out. It has the capacity to draw you in, to enthrall you, to capture you, as the history of the family, community and period is unfolded. The Story told is not just a family history, but a history of Life. What may be classified as a &#39;River of Life&#39;

That&#39;s the question you have to ask yourself when you watch this movie &#34;What was the point?&#34; This movie was nothing but an hour and a half of confusion with completely unlikable people (not going to use the word actors) and a script that you could tell didn&#39;t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that made me laugh the most about this movie was how it said &#34;Victorian story written by&#34; which means that there was actually a script to that part of the story. The entire victorian section had no dialogue, and was just comprised of shots of a guy staring at a girl and vice versa. Making that part of the movie as scripted as a camera left on at a train station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, time for the story. It starts out with a guy sitting in a chair never once getting out of it. Oh blocking, who needs you? These newspeople come to his house and practically beg him to tell this story about these dead girls. So he starts off the story in Victorian times. and here&#39;s how the scene goes (Guy and girl are in a field. pretty music starts to play) (guy stares at girl) (girl stares at guy) (guy stares at girl) cut back to movie. That&#39;s pretty much all that happens for about half the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the film is incredibly awkward dialogue about a bunch of models wanting to buy an apartment. So this real estate agent shows them one and when i say the dialogue is awkward i mean, if it were a dancer it would trip during the MACARENA. None of the characters in this movie are likable. The models are incredibly irritating, the victorian people don&#39;t talk, and the guy telling the story has the personality of a sack of onions. So eventually all the girls get killed off. and by killed off, i mean drug offscreen. ooh. you showed ONE death? and by death i mean holding her face till they put the blood makeup on? awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW this guy even knows this story baffles me. He says it&#39;s because he saw it. but how? there was no guy in that apartment! the door was locked shut with no way out, the windows were attached to a fire escape that was too rotten to work, how the HELL did he see all that? Oh plot holes. we DO love you. So the movie finishes up with the newswoman saying &#34;i think you made it up. you&#39;re wasting our time&#34; despite the fact that she begged him for the interview in the first place. Whatever. This movie was stupid, pointless, and made no sense with a lot of plot holes. I could go on and on about this movie, but i don&#39;t see the need. i&#39;d much rather spend my time doing something uselful. Like widdle something. &#34;Hell&#39;s Threshold&#34; more belongs in purgatory with 2 dumb models. out of 10.

Not too keen on this really. The story is pretty horrid and unconvincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, bill nunns good. After that it was pretty appalling. Tim doesn&#39;t fit the role, he comes across as a smug self inflated ass &amp; Pruitt taylor vince is entirely unconvincing as a trumpet player. It&#39;s a idealist film and as a musician, feel slightly offended after watching it. There&#39;s no scenes of 1900 practising or playing with his fellow band mates, he&#39;s completely self indulgent. I find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character, maybe i&#39;m watching the wrong film. If you have no real passion for life or sense of what musics all about then happily indulge in the suspension of disbelief and watch this waffle.

A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer become less clear as the film goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Rock  though as foul-mouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as Wesley. He is able to sublimate his manic energy and it only occasionally surfaces and always when it is needed most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some interesting allusions: the first time you see Betty she is dressed almost exactly like Dorothy Gale from the `Wizard of Oz&#39;  then later in the film she is compared to Dorothy when she says she has never been out of Kansas before. At one point the song that Doris Day was best known for, Que Sera Sera&#39; is on the soundtrack and then later Charlie (Morgan Freeman) describes her as having a whole Doris Day thing going on.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an extremely quirky film with good performances by everyone including the supporting cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a surprising ending that, as contrary as it sounds, is actually fairly predictable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If for no other reason see this film just to listen to the master of the human voice: Morgan Freeman.

Just as in &#34;Columbo&#34; we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike &#34;Columbo&#34;. It is William H. Macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his &#34;perfect crime&#34;. William H. Macy fans will enjoy &#34;A Slight Case Of Murder&#34;, as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities. Add some well timed comedy, and this is very similar to a fine episode of &#34;Columbo&#34;. Highly recommended. - MERK

I remember this game. It was always sitting on the shelves alone, until one day I decided to try something new for a change, and got this game. I stared in awe at it, since it was the first ever game for the PS1 that I owned that had 4 discs. When I played it, I couldn&#39;t put the controller down, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storyline of this game is so good and twisted, it&#39;s almost as good as the Final Fantasy VII Storyline, and that is hard to accomplish. When you play the game, you get so involved with the characters it&#39;s unbelievable that it&#39;s only a PS1 game, as It feels like a movie. And I believe it should be made into a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad this game is a very unheard of game and barely no one has played or liked it, as it is one of those games that is sitting on the ends of the shelves, with a 50% off sign sitting on it, trying to sell. Well I am one of those people who always look at those on the ends, and try them out and most of them turn out to be really good. Heck, that is how I got into final Fantasy VII, looking in a catalog, and finding it. But this is different than Final Fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legend of Dragoon, is the only game or RPG that is better than most Square Enix games, surprisingly. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was made by Square Enix but it&#39;s not. Hardly any games I play are better than the Final Fantasy series, or the Dragon Quest series, but this one is. But what really bugs me is why it is very little known and is not praised, which it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graphics are pretty good for a PS1 game, but what can you expect from it? It&#39;s PS1 man, made in 1999. Story I have already mentioned is amazing, almost beats VII. Characters are a amazing, you get involved so much with them, and their actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite 10 out of 10. Definitely deserved more praise, and a very well done RPG by a company other than Square Enix.

Hilarious film about divine retribution. Camera work stinks (shot on digital video) and looks like early MTV videos. Turn the other cheek by looking past the visual and concentrate on the story. Laughs galore for those with a well-developed sense of irony.

Can u believe a college professor made this film?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same man who made DHOOP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is horrible and has some of the weird scenes ever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main message is nice but presented badly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film looks like a collage of amateurish scenes, miscasts.etc and bad performances&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Direction and everything is poor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music is okay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emraan&#39;s naughty streak works and he does well Tusshar is bad Tanushree and Isha are bad Paresh annoys when he looks at the mirror

Well I just paid a dollar for a DVD of this movie, and it wasn&#39;t even worth that. It seems to be from a poor print and is in the public domain, I am guessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neagle - despite her glory, awards, and reputation - is a homely British gal who can&#39;t sing or dance or act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the fine old Hollywood character actors on display here must have thought they were doing a classic. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle&#39;s husband) always thought Anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen. He was mistaken. She was improbably popular in Britain before and after WWII. Her &#34;serious&#34; roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented. Skip this one and find the one that stars Doris Day. At least you get some real comedy and professional style dancing!

During the Clete Roberts preface, I was beginning to think this was an Ed Wood production, however, what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff. The story of crime and corruption in a Southern town is told using a cast culled from Hollywood&#39;s Poverty Row, and this makes the movie all the more realistic. There are no punches pulled here, and at times the film is reminiscent of &#34;The Well&#34;(1951). The Black and White texture gives a newsreel-like quality. For certain, younger viewers will be reminded of &#34;The Blair Witch Project&#34; but this one IS based on REAL events!

I caught this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival. I hadn&#39;t heard much about it; only that it was a tightly-paced thriller, shot digitally on a very low budget. I was hoping to catch the next big Brit-Flick. But I have to say, I was severely disappointed. &#34;This Is Not A Love Song&#34; follows two criminals, who, after accidentally shooting and killing a farmer&#39;s young daughter, become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a British film. The camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story, as are the over the top performances, and the appalling use of slow motion, which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video. There are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty, which instead come over as hilarious and over the top(Cue a pathetic, obligatory drug scene, and countless, pointless camera zooms). No amount of cliche&#39;s such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;ve seen this kind of thing many times before, and made a hundred times better, particularly in John Boorman&#39;s masterful &#34;Deliverance.&#34; But while in the latter film, we actually cared about the characters, in this film, I found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible. Even this wouldn&#39;t have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile, but instead, are merely a collection of stereotypical, inbred-looking countryfolk. Again, another offensive, overused cliche&#39; coming to the fore. Surely there are some nice people in the country, filmmakers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In its defense, &#34;This Is Not A Love Song&#34; does contain a couple of good, suspenseful moments, but it&#39;s hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video, or, at a push, getting a very limited cinema release. It&#39;s not a patch on last year&#39;s Low-Budget hunted in the hills movie, &#34;Dog soldiers&#34;. Maybe British Cinema could actually get kick-started again if the right money stopped going to the wrong people.

First I have to admit that I have had some doubts about the director. He has done some movies (with Jarkovsky) about the recent &#34;czech=east&#34; history or more precisely about families (individuals) how did they survive some historical moments. But it was always like the chines food sour-sweet. This movie was totally different. It was pure, it shows the bones of life, it shows the variations of human natures. This film is an excellent piece of art (story, acting, picture, music) but it shows you the life around you in much brighter light that we don&#39;t want to see. By the way I have saw it on a DVD (with English subtitles) but I am afraid that in the USA I wont be able to get it.

Why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and the Apollo moon-landing with the Titanic sinking and you&#39;ve got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low-life trash. Is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to Woodstock and who failed grade school composition do? &#34;I&#39;ll show those old meanies, I&#39;ll put out my own movie and prove that you don&#39;t have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money!&#34; Yeah, we already know that. The one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking. The next time I see a slut in a bar who looks like Diane Lane, I&#39;m running the other way. It&#39;s child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids. It&#39;s audience abuse to simply stick Woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays 1969.

I recall seeing this movie as a kid. I don&#39;t recall where I saw it. I must have been around 14 years old. I thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again. It came on the Kung Fu channel once, but I missed it. I was really bummed. It is the best special-effects Kung Fu movie that I&#39;ve seen to date! I highly recommend it, and now that I&#39;ve discovered where to get it, I can enjoy it once more and for years to come. I also have to check out this Return of the Venom movie of which some have spoken so highly.

This is an OK adaptation, but not as good as the TV version. The actors are generally alright but I found Jeremy Northam rather wet as Mr Knightley, particularly compared to Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow is OK and her English accent is pretty good but again, I preferred Kate Beckinsale&#39;s Emma. There are excellent support performances from Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script is often played too much for laughs, the book is a comedy, but there are too many set-piece gags here, and also the Frank Churchill subplot is almost completely absent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest criticism is the scenery. It is far too lush. England has never been like this. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans would make it like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite these criticisms I enjoyed this film but would recommend the TV adaptation more.

Hare Rama Hare Krishna was the biggest hit movie of 1971. Filmed almost entirely in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, the movie depicts not only with the theme of a broken family, but also a relationship between a brother and a sister, as well as drugs and the hippie movement, which made many people think that it involved the ISKON - the movement for Krishna consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie begins with scenes of drugs and being informed that the woman dancing in front is the narrator&#39;s sister. Going back to the past the brother and sister are happily playing around the house only to hear their parents arguing. This soon leads to a split in the family. The brother goes with the mother and the sister with the father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As years pass, the brother goes in search of his sister and is informed that she no longer lives with the father and that she has moved to Nepal. Here, Prashant, the brother not only finds love, but he also finds his sister, Janice. But he finds out that she is not only in the wrong company of friends but is also on drugs as she wants to block all memory of her past. With help of Shanti, his love, the brother tries to get his sister away from all this but has to overcome many obstacles, including people who stoop to all sorts of levels to stop him This is a multi cast movie and is led by the director and producer himself, Dev Anand and also stars Zeenat Aman (her first movie), Mumtaz, Rajendranath, Prem Chopra, Jnr Mehmood, A.K. Hangal and Achala Sachdev. The music is superbly provided by the late R.D. Burman, whose last score was &#34;1942 - A Love Story.&#34; During the filming, Dev Anand asked Panchamda (R.D. Burman) to compose something special for this film. Days later Panchamda came back with the composition of &#34;Dum Maro Dum.&#34; The song was an instant hit.

This show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel. It is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera. It&#39;s tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest &amp; then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also borrows from an early CBS game show pioneer- Beat The Clock- by inventing situations for its contestants to try &amp; overcome. Then it rewards the winner money. If they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters, even better. While the game format is in slow motion versus Beat The Clock- the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show has elements of several types of successful past programs. Reality television, hardly, but if your hooked on the contestants, locale or contest, this is your cup of tea. If your not, this entire series is as I say, drivel dripping with gravy. It is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is slick &amp; well produced, so it might last a while yet. After all, so do re-runs of Gilligan&#39;s Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies &amp; The Brady Bunch. This just doesn&#39;t employ professional actors. The intelligence level is about the same.

When Patricia Newell is attacked after witnessing her cousin&#39;s murder,Detective Carrella searches the city for her killer.Identifying the murderer after an intensive manhunt,Patricia is sent to live with relatives in the country.For Carrella the case is closed...or is it?&#34;Blood Relatives&#34; is an overlooked masterpiece.Donald Sutherland plays a cop and it&#39;s nice to see Donald Pleasance in a small role as a child molester.The conclusion is pretty disturbing.Still &#34;Blood Relatives&#34; is more of a mystery than a horror film,so fans of gore will be disappointed.A must-see for fans of old-fashioned mystery movies.9 out of 10.

I rented this movie for a few laughs. I had never seen the SNL skit, but with hits like Tommy Boy, and Waynes World, it couldn&#39;t have been that bad, could it? The answer: it was. This movie hardly was a means of relaxing after a hard day at work. I just kept waiting for a plotline and a funny part, but there wasn&#39;t any. The highlight was tiffany amber thieson, and thats just about it.

This movies chronicles the life and times of William Castle. He made a series of low budget horror films in the 1950s-1960s that he sold with gimmicks. In &#34;13 Ghosts&#34; you need viewers to see the ghosts (they were in color, the film was in b&amp;w). &#34;The Tingler&#34; had theatre seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre. &#34;Marabre&#34; issued a life insurance policy to all members in case they were frightened to death! The movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them. In this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by Castle, actors in his movies and his daughter. It also gets into his home life and the kind of man he was (by all accounts he was a great guy). The documentary is affectionate, very funny and absolutely riveting. It&#39;s very short (under 90 minutes) and there&#39;s never a dull moment. A must see for Castle fans and horror movie fans. My one complaint--there were very few sequences shown from his pictures. That aside this is just great.

Inglourious Basterds IS Tarantino&#39;s worst film he has ever made. It&#39;s full of his usual ingredient&#39;s i.e. snappy dialogue, brutal and sudden violence, but it all feel&#39;s deja-vu. The directing is typical Tarantino and nothing seem&#39;s new at all. It&#39;s almost as if he&#39;s copied exactly from his only masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing new or exciting about Inglourious Basterds to be honest, it&#39;s just a war drama that isn&#39;t funny, nor brilliant as Pulp Fiction was. Basterds supposedly is Tarantino&#39;s tribute to Leone&#39;s Spaghetti western&#39;s but seem&#39;s mis-jointed and out of place especially with the continuing use of big sub-titles and throw&#39;s the audience of balance.

I have seen &#34;Chasing the Dragon&#34; several times and have enjoyed it each time. The acting was superb. This movie really makes you realize how one bad choice at a weak moment can change your life.

I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch. Ben&#39;s character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint, I would definitely say he has a future in acting after Harry Potter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura Linney is quite good in her role as Ben&#39;s over protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too....Villain-y. Ben&#39;s father was also an interesting contrast to his mother, and in the end he is quite honourable too. The only character i wasn&#39;t keen on was Bryony, she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch. one of my favourite films of the year easily.

Shakespeare would have been outraged. The writers mutilated Shakespeare&#39;s amazing work. Ariel is the only believable acting performance. The African voodoo, secluded swamp, and &#34;Gator Man&#34; character make the movie a mockery of Shakespeare&#39;s true Tempest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t waste your eye-sight on this movie.

Basically the exact same movie as &#34;House of Wax&#34; - Vincent Price&#39;s first genuine horror hit released the previous year - but seriously who cares, because &#34;The Mad Magician&#34; offers just as many sheer thrills, delightful period set-pieces, joyous 3-D effects, sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor! &#34;Never change a winning team&#34; is exactly what writer Crane Wilbur must have thought when he penned down Price&#39;s character Don Gallico, another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him. Don Gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as Gallico the Great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history; entitled &#34;The Girl and the Buzz Saw&#34;. Gallico&#39;s promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer Ross Ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose, stating that all of Gallico&#39;s inventions are the rightful property of the company. The sleazy and relentless Ormond, who by the way also ransacked Gallico&#39;s once beloved wife, takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of Gallico&#39;s rival The Great Rinaldi. Inevitably Gallico snaps and sadistically butchers Ormond, but  also being a master of creating disguises  recreates his victim&#39;s image and even starts leading a double life. &#34;The Mad Magician&#34; is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50&#39;s horror movie in Grand Guignol style, with a whole lot of improbably plot twists (the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist?) and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross-out moments (although they obviously remain suggestive for most part). The 3-D delights near the beginning of the film, like a yo-yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains, merely just serve as time-filler and contemporary 50&#39;s hype, but it&#39;s still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them. &#34;The Mad Magician&#34; is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view, as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of Alice Prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era. Needless to state that Vincent Price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film, as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in. Like no other actor could ever accomplish, Price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way. You pity Don Gallico, yet at the same time you fear him enormously. You support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death. Vincent Price simply was a genius actor and, in my humble opinion, the embodiment of the horror genre.

Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon came along, there&#39;s been a lot of talk about a revival of the Hong Kong movie industry. Don&#39;t believe it. The people now making movies in HK give new meaning to the word crass. Running Out of Time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name draw, here, but he spends most of the film just grinning idiotically and flipping a coin. He flips the coin over and over and again and again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a cop who chases after the coin-flipping pretty boy. But once again: who knows why? There&#39;s a pretty actress in the female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but she mostly just looks like she would rather be at a spa or shopping centre than in front of a camera. Nothing makes any sense. There is no action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. All there is is a name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who cares?

A delight mini movie, a musical short based on three of Cole Porter&#39;s Broadway smash songs. Bob Hope&#39;s first credited film is a delight! He plays an American playboy millionaire on vacation in Paris. The film opens with him sitting at a table of an out door café telling his friends about this beauty that takes his breath away. Suddenly he spots her a few yards away. he is so over come his friends tease him and suggest &#34;just show her your bank book.&#34; But Hope claims he can win her in less than 30 days with &#34;no&#34; money! They bet polo ponies over the issue and take all his cash and ID&#39;s. Hope follows her and when they are alone gushes out a proposal she does not believe he is sincere until he sings to her, &#34;You Do Something to Me&#34; by Cole Porter. But she must leave and he tries to earn money as a tour guide so he can pursue her. But when she sees him showing another girl around town, disillusioned she wants to drop him. He continues to chase her and catches up to her and her family at a race track where he bets his meager earnings on the last race hoping to win enough to impress her. Through a series of events and large synchronized dance numbers he loses the winning ticket and she decides to marry him rich or poor. So he wins the girl, the race and the bet and sings two more songs!

&#34;Perhaps we can arrange a meet. &#34; &#34;Where are you now? &#34; &#34;I&#39;m sitting in my office. &#34; &#34;I doubt that. &#34; &#34;Why would you doubt that? &#34; &#34;If you were in your office right now we&#39;d be having this conversation face-to-face. &#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bourne remains street tough, and elusive. Only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy. Conversation is macho, to the point with only shards of Bond type gallows humour. Its all about the action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so well. A scene set in Waterloo with a Guardian journalist does this to great effect. There is no meeting of worlds - you are in it or just a superfluous body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the shaky cam doesn&#39;t annoy you too much, enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going.

The London Underground has something inherently creepy about it, with its long winding tunnels, the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground, and of course the rats roaming the tracks.It a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often. It was used in the seventies horror Deathline aka Raw Meat, featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel, and the celebrated chase sequence in American Werewolf in London. So I was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent UK production Creep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the film started off well, with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving, followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of London. However, Creep went downhill from here, and I found myself wishing that I&#39;d switched it off after this opening scene, leaving me with a favourable impression of the film. All the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable, even Potente herself, and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness. he also made the mistake of showing the &#34;monster&#34; in full lighting, where he ceases to become remotely scary, and reveals his name to be Craig. How can you have a monster called Craig? It turns into an X Files-type thing, and reminds one of the episode Tombs. In fact, I was wishing Mulder and Scully would turn up and sort them all out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the infamous sexualised violence, it is very graphic, disturbing and totally unnecessary. It seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value. The trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror, which is a mistake as it&#39;s only halfway through the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you go. The only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from Ken Campbell, one of my favourite occasional actors. You don&#39;t see him very often, but when he&#39;s on screen he acts everyone else into a corner. Casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius, unfortunately the only one evident in the film.

Is there anything else on earth to be more enticing than to learn what expects our frail bodies after, um, death. Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà (a soul-mate of his German colleague Jörg Buttgereit) provides blow-by-blow answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables, scalpels, surgical saws, human entrails and warped minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the autopsy room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know which facets of the film, apart of its notorious reputation, may have helped it to acquire sufficiently high rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storywise it&#39;s fairly simple and straightforward - a day in the life (actually half an hour) of a troubled coroner (or, perhaps, assistant pathologist or whoever he is) that is fed up with his routine morbid duty and discharges his psychological tension in a non-traditional fashion, right at his workplace. I&#39;m perplexed of what particular message the authors tried to deliver with this one-note plot. I suspect it may be somehow inspired by Udo Kier&#39;s character&#39;s quirky demeanor in Andy Warhol&#39;s Frankenstein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artistic values of the film are also questionable. It&#39;s hard to evaluate the performance of the actors that don&#39;t squeeze a single word. Their emotions are concealed behind the medical masks. There&#39;s also not enough room for great camera-work - basically, the entire action unfolds mostly within four walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authenticity - effects and makeup are impressive and the setup looks very plausible, but only a handful of medical/forensic experts can judge how truthful and anatomically correct the dissection is carried out here (if anyone cares). Honestly, I used to think that the autopsy is done to examine the condition of particular organs and to ascertain the cause of death. Now I know that dead bodies are severed, raped and humiliated, intestines are ripped apart, brains are retrieved from the head, stuffed into abdomen and mixed with guts, then the body is stitched back and washed - nothing personal. And what are these poor lads expected to write in their deceitful autopsy reports afterward?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shock and disgust factor - it&#39;s much unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would discover, to his horror, that the disc he was intended to watch with his wife and kids beside a Christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video manual on vivisection. This obscure item is barely available, sought by people well familiar with the subject and not easily offended. Hence it would be pointless to warn anyone to sabotage this film. They are well aware what exactly they are watching and what they want to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cerdà is really gifted and stylish director, which is clearly obvious from at least two other parts of his &#34;trilogy&#34; - preceding &#39;The Awakening&#39;, amazing black and white short, and 30-minute &#39;Genesis&#39;, visually stunning and moody piece with an off-beat and interesting concept. And I&#39;m pretty sure that one day he will conquer the hearts of moviegoers with his new, more mainstream oriented, material. And sooner or later &#39;Aftermath&#39; would become a rarity for the meticulous collectors of his &#34;early&#34; &#34;warm-up&#34; works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the meantime, I&#39;m afraid, it may be recommended strictly for medical students or specialists that study mental disorders and sexual deviations.

Fascinating and amusingly bad, Lights of New York is the first all talkie feature and one that almost never saw the light of day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two naive barbers (Eddie and Gene) from out of town get involved with bootleggers and end up fronting a speak. When a cop is shot by one of the bootleggers the police start to close in, and the Hawk (who shot the officer) decides to pin the murder on Eddie instructing his henchman to &#34;take him for a ride&#34;. But it&#39;s the Hawk himself who takes the bullet in a twist that will surprise few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shot in one week at a cost of $23,000, &#34;Lights&#34; was originally meant as a two reeler but Foy took advantage of Jack Warner&#39;s absence to extend it to six. When Warner discovered this he ordered Foy to cut it back to the original short. Only when an independent exhibitor offered $25k for the film, did Warners actually look at the film, which went on to make a staggering $1.3 million.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seen now this is an extremely hokey piece, with acting that ranges from the passable (Eugene Pallette) to trance like (Eddie&#39;s Granny in a particularly risible scene) and much of the playing is at the level of vaudeville. Since it&#39;s an early talkie (4 part-talkies preceded it) that&#39;s about all the characters do, and very slowly at that. The script feels improvised, visual style is non existent (apart from the shooting scene done in silhouette) and scenes grind on interminably. Title cards are intercut which redundantly announce characters and locales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all this &#34;Lights&#34; is a compelling experience, as we watch actors and crew struggling with the alien technology, and changing cinema for ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catch it if you can

One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it starts to become satire, is that it be somewhat plausible. I would think that an anti-matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended. But I&#39;ll leave that to the physicists who might have seen Solar Crisis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a crisis the earth is facing because solar flares are getting totally out of hand. They&#39;re getting close to Earth, so much so that it&#39;s become unseasonably hot, as if the entire Earth were Death Valley. The answer is an anti-matter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there. That will divert the flares off in say the direction of say Mercury providing it&#39;s not in direct alignment with the Earth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who to deliver it, but captain Tim Matheson and his crew. That is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son, Corin Nemec. Taking care of the personal side of the family problems is admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson&#39;s father, and Nemec&#39;s grandfather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s a villain here too, Peter Boyle who is the CEO of a multi-national corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the world&#39;s food supply for the survivors. The idea he might not survive doesn&#39;t enter into his thinking. He&#39;s doing his best to sabotage Matheson&#39;s mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solar Crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001, A Space Odyssey and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Boyle seems to be taking his cue from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently he&#39;s the only one in the cast who realizes he&#39;s in a turkey and overacts accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the cast are stalwart, true blue and dull. Except possibly desert rat Jack Palance who finds Nemec and cares for him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key here is that the film was directed by that noted Hollywood purveyor of flop films, Allen Smithee. The film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a Thanksgiving carving.

I used to watch this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it pretty well. If you ask me, it was a pretty good show. Anytime I think about it, I don&#39;t remember the opening sequence and theme song very well. In addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. Also, the writing was very strong. The performances were top-grade, too. I hope some network brings it back so I can see every episode. Before I wrap this up, I&#39;d like to say that I&#39;ll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.

The best Modesty Blaise movie I have seen so far. It&#39;s like a good pilot for a TV-series. I even think it&#39;s a little bit &#34;cult&#34;, like with a lite touch of Quentin Tarantino&#39;s magic, or something. They have caught a great deal of Modesty&#39;s character, but I admit missing Willy Garwin a bit. Even if i have read many comics and book by Peter O&#39;donnell I&#39;m not disappointed of this film, quite the opposite. Positive surprised of this story about Modesty and her childhood. I did not put my expectations so high, because of the bad movie from 1966. So I may have overrate this movie just a little. But if you like the comics and other storys about Modesty Blaise, you should definitely see this one! can&#39;t wait for a follow-up...

And I&#39;ll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was very ill-advised. EVERYTHING CONCERNING DRUGS IS CUT OUT AND COVERED UP!!! How do they do it, you might ask? Well, they don&#39;t do it very well, that&#39;s for sure. Anyway, instead of the marijuana which Cheech and Chong are supposed to have in their possession, they are said to have diamonds! Still, the characters go around in a haze of marijuana smoke stoning others along their way with no explanation whatsoever!

4 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was neither funny as a whole nor was it even worthing investing any kind of emotion into the characters. Eugene Levy is probably the most funny.... The rest of the cast do their jobs, but the story never really gets very deep and there are a lot of holes in the plot that never get filled. This just wasn&#39;t very much fun, despite being funny at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Little did I know that when I signed up the the &#34;all pay channel&#34; package with Direct TV that I would face a movie like this. It came on right after another movie we had been watching... and I was a teenager in 1981 so am not sure where I was at the time... but I missed this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also can&#39;t believe we left it on. It is kind-of funny as it takes you back in the time machine to the early 80s... but I think even then this would have been a painful movie. It was just... well... &#34;too cute&#34;! ET was &#34;cute&#34; in a way... but not obnoxiously cute... and stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I see a movie like this... I come on onto IMDb to see what others say. I am blown away that this thing was nominated! Wow... the movie industry has come a long way since the 80s! Oh well... it did show some old actors... btw that is the other thing I was surprised about... the lineup... not a bunch of no-names... but some real actors/actresses. Must have been in their drug days! Anyways... odd, interesting, bizarre, and makes one happy they grew up!

This short has all the elements of a great movie. Every time I show it to friends (on DVR) they love it too. The dialog is so, &#39;real&#39;. The acting is superb. While the effects/props weren&#39;t as convincing by themselves, taken with everything else in the shot, they are expertly placed/used. The music is so haunting, perfect for this kind of &#39;moment&#39; film. People who hold dear their beliefs and thoughts are shaken to their core about what they see in this movie. Most go &#39;that&#39;s it?&#39;, but in the end they blossom with new understanding, and leave the movie with one word to describe it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Beautiful&#39;. The beauty of the film is also skin deep. I love the fact that there aren&#39;t any conflicting views, no other voices, and the voices that you do hear, are agreeing with each other. no conflict, but at the same time there is one. And the ending made me love it more! Harsh reality sometimes IS more film worthy than any plot device, or twist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(wasn&#39;t Joshua Leonard the guy in Blair Witch Project?) :) Movie by a fictitious dead guy..great!

Did you ever watch a really bad movie and get mad about it? Even a movie you didn&#39;t have high expectations for? Well I just rented the movie &#34;Dead Line&#34;. This is the US video title for &#34;Interferencia&#34;. Now I have seen a lot of bad movies, and watched a lot of &#34;B&#34; titles, but this is in another league all its own. It was put out on &#34;The Asylum&#34; label, and anyone that rents a lot of direct to video horror films knows this label. When you rent one of there&#39;s you know what your getting. A lot of marginal acting low budget horror, but usually still pretty good. Not this one. The acting by the three leads was beyond bad. Even fast forwarding couldn&#39;t help. The tag line on the front of the box says&#34;..in the tradition of DePalma&#39;s Body Double. The nerve to compare this to that classic movie. The only true comment is &#34;The screams you will hear are real&#34;. Yea you will be the one screaming if you rent this.

This film tries to skewer the studio era in Hollywood and the morals of the 1950s. Guy Stone is intended to be a Rock Hudson type, but both the script and actor Matt Letscher end up channeling a smarmy, cruel, baritone-voiced version of George Hamilton instead, which makes for an unpleasant character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guy Stone is such a reprehensible human being that the audience has trouble liking this waste of human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was sweetly promiscuous, Stone is a hateful person who knowingly uses and then throws away the sweet, handsome young men who share his bed every few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, Stone&#39;s celibate lesbian manager. Cartwright is very good, but the director doesn&#39;t quite know what to do with her. The fault lies in the dialogue, which is a bit clumsy, and the film suffers for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrie Preston&#39;s Sally owes more to Ellen Greene in &#34;The Little Shop of Horrors&#34;. As written, Preston&#39;s Sally is good for a laugh but little else. Newcomer Adam Greer is lost in this movie. He cannot act, and seems to have been cast for his hot body and good looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many recent films, &#34;Straight-Jacket&#34; is a &#34;dramedy&#34; -- a comedy film which switches messily to a drama about two-thirds of the way through the film. And, like almost all dramedies, &#34;Straight-Jacket&#34; fails miserably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the expensive services of Skywalker Sound, the sound quality of the film leaves a lot of be desired. The over-use of the musical soundtrack creates a distracting amount of cues as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film really doesn&#39;t managed to satirize anything about the 1950s. Unlike &#34;Singin&#39; in the Rain,&#34; which perfectly captures Hollywood&#39;s ambivalence about the advent of sound as well as the studio mentality about formula films, &#34;Straight-Jacket&#34; doesn&#39;t manage to depict Hollywood in the 1950s at all well. The dialogue, sets and behavior of the key characters are nondescript rather than dead-on stereotypes of the 1950s Hollywood. The same can be said for the lampooning of the general mores, social trends and fads of the 1950s as a whole. Compare the transformation of Guy&#39;s home to the dead-on satire of the 1950s home in &#34;Little Shop of Horrors&#34;. There is no comparison; &#34;Little Shop&#34; hits the nail on the head, while &#34;Straight-Jacket&#34; doesn&#39;t even know there is a nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motivations, too, seem haphazard. Rick Foster is supposed to be a principled liberal, yet he falls almost immediately for a materialistic schmuck like Guy Stone. Rick is fine with Guy&#39;s closeted status for many months. But when it comes time to go to Italy, he becomes conflicted for reasons that are completely unclear. And even though Sally appears to fall in love with Freddie during the party, this plot point simply disappears a few minutes later without comment. Rick comes off like a gay man from the 1990s, not a gay author of the 1950s. Indeed, modern morality suffuses this film -- which it shouldn&#39;t, if it were really a satirical look at homophobia in 1950s Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot holes in this ragtag film also abound. Saul repeatedly says that he&#39;s going to turn Freddie Stevens over to the feds, but never does so -- allowing Freddie to out Guy. Jerry and Saul&#39;s plot to &#34;in&#34; Guy never makes any sense, nor does Sally&#39;s sudden decision to take the blame. And although Guy has admitted he is a homosexual, apparently it doesn&#39;t matter and he ends up a famous star and playwright anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, none of the production values manage to save this film. The cinematography by Michael Pinkey is pedestrian. At times, the film almost looks like a filmed play rather than a motion picture (especially the scenes in Saul&#39;s office). Everything is restricted to medium shots, and the film has an incredibly static. The editing by Chris Conlee doesn&#39;t do the film any help, either. Long scenes which would benefit from the insertion of close-ups or shifts in point of view remain uncut. Whether this is due to lack of coverage or bad editing is not clear, but the overall effect is to create a sense of lethargy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film relies heavily on CGI effects of Guy&#39;s home, created by visual effect designer Thomas Dickens. But the CGI looks clumsy and hokey, and it is very noticeably amateurish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall impression of this film is that the jokes are cheap and easy, the plot muddled, the characterizations wildly inconsistent and way off the mark, the satire nonexistent, the performances overbroad and off the mark, and the comic timing off. It&#39;s almost an amateurish film. It is as if someone took a high school production and threw $10 million at it.

When I went to see this movie i thought that this would just be another chic flick i would have to endure with my sister. Plus too Amanda Baynes last movie was not so hot, making me doubt the movie for she is the lead actress.However within 5mins i was laughing so hard i had tears in my eyes, the jokes were not &#34;out there&#34; that it took more then a second to understand it but very funny. The script was not too complex that I could not understand the love triangle but was very true to the original play by Shakepeare. I loved every minute of it so much that I kicked a guy two seats away from me in a fit of laughter lol!!! very embarrassing! I&#39;d definitely advise people to see this movie especially girls as the guys in this movie are hot hot hot!!(lol) so much so that I might just get it on DVD.

I haven&#39;t seen this, &amp; don&#39;t plan to see this movie or any other that includes Lindsay......unless &amp; until &#34;poor little rich girl&#34; straightens out her life for a 2 year period beginning with her most recent arrest in July 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I don&#39;t know anyone that has gone to see ANY of Lindsay&#39;s recent movies. I rather imagine 2007 will be the high water mark in her movie making career, until she cleans up her act. All of the recent publicity has only hindered her movie making career, if she has any further aspirations to make any more movies &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up to this time, movie producers have actively sought Lindsay for roles in their upcoming production. Now, Lindsay will probably have to go to auditions &amp; actually compete for ANY role. Her reputation is currently &#34;poison&#34; &amp; quite possible could have a negative effect on box office ticket sales on any movie she is in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo....now Lindsay is going to have to deal with &#34;not being wanted&#34;.....is she going to be able to handle this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if even Jay Leno will want to have Lindsay back on his TV Show?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the foregoing is merely my OPINION. I have no inside information.

Said to be inspired from Disney&#39;s The Little Mermaid, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is Japanese animation master, Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s next big work after the well-received Spirited Away in 2001 and Howl&#39;s Moving Castle in 2004. In Ponyo, his signature style of animating fantasy realms and children characters are on display once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), the boy lead in the film discovers a &#39;goldfish&#39; trapped in a glass jar while playing by the seaside below the cliff. He stays with his mum, Lisa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) above and atop it. Sosuke shakes the jar forcefully to try and get the &#39;goldfish&#39; out but the little &#39;goldfish&#39; is stuck. He then tries to pull it out but it just cannot come loose. Sosuke then place the jar on the ground before smashing a small rock onto it, breaking it into pieces instantly while suffering a small cut on the finger. He then checks inquisitively to see if the &#39;goldfish&#39; is still alive. As he observes it, the &#39;goldfish&#39; reacts by licking the blood off his finger suddenly. Excited, Sosuke quickly rushes back to the house and put the &#39;goldfish&#39; in a small bucket of water in hope that it will survive. It did and he named it &#39;Ponyo&#39;(Yuria Nara).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above scene would signify what is to come for the remainder of the film. It is of the interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo. And it is one that Hayao Miyazaki did meticulously well in portraying. He must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before he depicts this chemistry of communication between the two main characters. The behavior of the children would also extend into the rest of the film in their further encounters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The affection between Sosuke and Ponyo grew as the film progresses from the moment Sosuke brought Ponyo to school in Lisa&#39;s car. The best moment came when the two were reunited after a brief separation when Ponyo&#39;s father, Fujimoto (George Tokoro), a magical sea dweller recaptures the errant Ponyo before encapsulating her in a magic bubble with kind intention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fujimoto who was once human has grown to refer humans with disgust for polluting the sea and stealing its life. But all Ponyo wants is to be human and be with Sosuke so for a second time she escapes, accidentally emptying his father&#39;s precious store of magical elixir into the sea, creating a storm of tidal waves and engulfing the small town in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows are the adventures of Sosuke and Ponyo in the flooded town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there a happily ever after in this one? Would true love prevail? You find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the art in Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, there appears to be a deviation from Miyazaki&#39;s past works in terms of rendering. It looks unfamiliar because the environment apart from the characters at play in every scene is not colored in the usual fashion as in Spirited Away (2001) and Howl&#39;s Moving Castle (2004). The aesthetical appeal is discounted from what appears to be color penciled drawings. The objects and characters are also not as detailed as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is peculiar if taken on face value but from the way the story is written and told, the possible explanation is that Miyazaki is allowing the audience to view the film with a child&#39;s tint, yet allowing the adults to reminisce on a Japan when they were younger. This move could have prevented prospective moviegoers, new to Miyazaki&#39;s work to see it. The trailer did nothing to promote Ponyo as well. Taking the case to Japan however would be a different story as Miyazaki&#39;s credential far than exceed any marketing technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary though, the whole did not equal to its parts. Aside from Miyazaki&#39;s ability to cast vivacious and animated characters, the film lacks elements of thrill and wonder when measured against previous works, resulting in a deficit of big screen presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sparks of Ponyo and Sosuke failed to light up the film in a big way but moments of warmth, kindness, and love can still be found in recognizing the film as one that is not made for the kids, but of the kids who everyone is or once was.

... but the keyword here is &#34;usually.&#34; I have been known to adore movies EVERYONE thinks are dumb. But in the world of B-rated movies, THIS one is Z-rated. Absolutely ridiculous. The thing I respect about most of my favorite B-rated movies are that they don&#39;t take themselves too seriously. The makers of movies like that sort-of treat the movie lightly, even if it&#39;s a heavy topic. I get the impression, however, that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously, like they were putting together a 10-star classic, complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots. Nevertheless, despite all this, I STILL gave it 4 out of 10 stars, as I am biased towards movies like this. If you&#39;re a B-rated fan, however, I would try too hard to find this one.

This rather formulaic swords and flying fists movie is a decent early display of John Woo&#39;s talents. The cinematography is excellent and some of the sword work is truly remarkable. Unfortunately the film labours under the burden of a dull story and a glaringly low budget (check some of the setbound fight scenes if you doubt me). Nonetheless, it&#39;s worth seeing, especially if you can catch in letterboxed.

Definitely an odd debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him. Cecil grabs a phone book, looks up the name of a preacher, and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher&#39;s home and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart. That makes everything all better. Ahh...if only everything in life were that easy. The fact that this &#34;film&#34; looks as if it was made with about $500 certainly doesn&#39;t help. 1/10

I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations. I had seen Jacquet&#39;s previous movie (march of the penguins) and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio. However, I was severely disappointed. Most of all, this movie is terribly boring. Literally NOTHING happens. I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend, and we both ended up laughing because I could only stammer things like &#34;well then the winter comes, and then spring, and then there&#39;s an eagle, and a river, and one time it is dark, and the girl goes into a cave, and another time the fox has babies&#34; and so on. After about half an hour I began sighing, yawning, rolling my eyes, cursing the reviewer at the radio station, and hoping that it would be over soon. But the movie went on and on. When it finally ended I had sunken so deep into my chair that I must have looked somewhat similar to Stephen Hawking. The most annoying parts of the movie are (a) The girl, who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with. She wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie (one year), and shows exactly two facial expressions: Joy and Seriousness. She is cute, no question about that. However, a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all-too-human presence. I found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear, drown in the river, or something similarly terrible. (b) The commentary by the girl&#39;s adult voice, which tells us nothing but negligible, obvious, boring, redundant things. (c) The music, which is desperately lacking subtlety. When the girl is happily jumping around, the music jumps around, too. When the fox is threatened by an eagle, the music becomes threatening, too. It reminded me of the very early days of film-making, and was just too predictable to enjoy. Admittedly, many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it, at least they got somehow involved. Thus, my warning concerns adults only: If you are over ten years old, avoid this movie. You can get a better (and cheaper) sleep in most other places.

Forbidden Planet represents the kind of science fiction that is precious in cinema, especially from the 1950s. There was The Day the Earth Stood Still and War of the Worlds, but lest not forget this gem which took some of its story from Shakespeare&#39;s The Tempest to tell a tale of astronauts on a planet that has a doctor on it who has made a remarkable breakthrough. It&#39;s the kind of breakthrough that is not so much incredible to look at (though for 1956 it does look quite amazing to look at some of those sets and that gigantic machine the doctor creates), but with its emphasis on the characters and its themes of technology taken too far by the more primitive side of human nature even when we don&#39;t know we&#39;re channeling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the surface- that is in the first ten minutes- it looks standard, if a little more professionally acted and directed with better skill than the B-movies of the period. A ship of astronauts are on a mission to the planet Altair-4 to bring back an expedition that went missing decades before. But the only one left is Dr. Morbis (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter, who somehow were immune to an attack that left everyone else dead. Morbius appears to be a cordial and highly intelligent man, and his technology looks to be so impressive that the only thing the astronauts, led by the Skipper (Leslie Nielsen), can think to do is to report it back to their superiors on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there&#39;s a catch - something is killing off members of the crew of the ship, one by one, every night, even when the others keep an eye out and then put up an invisible electric fence, which the invisible something goes through easily. Meanwhile, there&#39;s some romance possibly between the Skipper and Alraira, and there&#39;s a more pushy vibe from the doctor: you shouldn&#39;t have come to the planet to start, and now you need to go. What happens from this is even more fascinating, just on a purely intellectual level, but Forbidden Planet never forgets that its audience should also be entertained by this story while getting some useful ideas. While everyone may remember Robbie the Robot, and for good reason, perhaps the most unforgettable image for me is the monster realized on screen with the crew firing to no avail, animated with red electricity and looking so beastly that it looks out of Fantasia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting from Pidgeon is subtle: you wouldn&#39;t expect him to be a villain, though something is there in the character and in the performance that speaks to this, and by the end it makes the character far more complex than one would expect. And the other performances are workmanlike but also excellent, from Nielsen as a born leader to Holliman providing some great comic relief as the Cook (who, I should add, helps with one of the funniest scenes in the film with those gallons of bourbon Robbie provides). And the effects for its time are extraordinary (sophisticated in a nostalgic pulp way for today too), and the music, done by electronics, is beautiful in its &#34;tones&#34;. But ultimately it&#39;s the screenplay and careful direction from Hilcox that puts this a notch above the rest of the B-movie lot. When it&#39;s meant to be funny, it&#39;s intentionally so and it works. When it&#39;s dramatic it connects quite well even in its stiff moments with the actors. And when we are made to think about a horrible situation, it comes on gradually, with nuance, not shoved in our faces or injected with mega-action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An inspiration for many other sci-fi films, and a fine marker of thoughtful science fiction stories and books from time-old, it&#39;s a classy and entertaining classic.

In many ways DIRTY WORK is a predictable L&amp;H short on the surface with the boys going to sweep someone`s chimney . Guess what happens next ? That`s right slapstick at its most sucessful ensues .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there`s one or two things that seem untypical . Ollie for example is very unlikable , he`s arrogant , he`s rude , and not only to Stan look at the way he addresses the servant with &#34; HEY YOU &#34; and takes a childish huff very easily with his catchphrase being &#34; I have nothing to say &#34; . In short Ollie plays a bully in a very unlikable way and I much prefer to see him to play the arrogant coward where he`s always at his funniest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRTY WORK also lacks the reportary regulars of the other L&amp;H shorts like Finlayson , Long , Busch and Housman which means when we switch to the mad scientist plotline there`s a slightly creepy atmosphere that jars with the rest of the movie &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that this is still a good short mainly down to Stan . Also watch out for a scene featuring a fish . Many jokes/plots from L&amp;H feature fish and this is another one

Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O&#39; Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. Dumped by his girlfriend, a hotshot yuppie doesn&#39;t want to be left alone on Christmas so he decides to return to his boyhood home, imposing on the dysfunctional family that now lives there and bribes them to pose as his family. An obnoxious and one-dimensional performance by Affleck, who mainly acts with a flashy smile, makes his character come off as a mentally unbalanced creep, but Gandolfini and O&#39; Hara breathe some life into this mess. Even for farce, its silliness is lumbering, not much makes sense from scene to scene, and its sentimental messages are as phony as Affleck&#39;s grin. 91 min., rated PG-13. * ½

&#39;Flood&#39; is a prime example of how throwing good actors and cgi at a film will do little to compensate for a rubbish script. The basic premise is fine: what if a freak storm threatened to send the sea straight over the Thames flood barriers and engulf London so fast that most of the inhabitants would probably never get out in time? It&#39;s basically the New York segment of &#39;The Day After Tomorrow&#39;, but that shouldn&#39;t make it any less of a film. However, the script just isn&#39;t there. It&#39;s merely functional, flat, and lacking in depth. Great British talents like Robert Carlysle and David Suchet to name but two do their level best with what they&#39;ve got, but their characters are two-dimensional cyphers, like something out of an old Marvel comic. and it&#39;d be frankly easier to turn back the tide. Not that every actor gets let off the hook - Tom Courtenay seemed capable of only one emotion throughout the film, but then he wasn&#39;t given much of a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applaud any opportunity to see some non-Hollywood disaster flicks for a change, and I don&#39;t expect zillions of dollars spent on rendering ultra- realistic graphics. However there&#39;s no excuse for shonky writing - especially from a country that has produced some of the best science- fiction ever made on next to no budget at all. This is the kind of half- hearted B-grade fluff the Sci-Fi channel produces, and that&#39;s hardly a target to aim for. If like me you are such a fan of disaster films you&#39;re still tempted, do yourself a favour and watch it with some friends. Better still; don&#39;t bother.

I wish it were &#34;Last Dumb Thriller&#34;. But thrillers are like that. They are like children: numerous, illogical, and often annoying. They want so desperately to be taken seriously but what is there to take seriously about a child&#39;s behaviour or a thriller&#39;s plot? Having seen this particular child - I mean... thriller - I understand why reviewers refer to it as &#34;a hitchcockian thriller&#34;; they might as well have called it &#34;idiotic&#34; for that&#39;s what &#34;hitchcockian&#34; means in the movie dictionary (look it up, if you don&#39;t believe me). Even the soundtrack is old-school Hollywood which is a mistake: it doesn&#39;t fit a late 70s film and makes it look phony. Besides, how dare they steal De Palma&#39;s idea of stealing from Hitchcock?! The story is absurd. Scheider&#39;s wife is killed, and her killers are never an issue. Instead, first his former employers follow him around, and later decide to kill him. Why do they decide to kill him? No explanation. Perhaps because the FBI is a dark, dark organization (&#34;X-Files&#34;) which is very trigger-happy about knocking off its former employees for pension-funds reasons. Or perhaps because it&#39;s fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this movie; everyone seems to be after him. And while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to figure out the mystery by logically assuming that there is a major conspiracy, in reality the killer is... Janet Margolin! Yes, the woman occupying Scheider&#39;s living quarters; the one that briefly hinted she was &#34;depraved&#34;. Why does she go after Scheider at precisely a time when his wife was murdered and he is feeling paranoid - and followed by his own ex-employers - and not a few years earlier or few years after the wife&#39;s murder? A pure hitchcockian (look it up again in the dictionary, in case you forgot what it means) coincidence. And how about that brilliant motive of hers...! Her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a fresh-off-the-boat 15 year-old virgin in NY, and then syphilisized by a bunch of horny Jewish men, one of whom - tah-dah! - is Scheider&#39;s grandfather. As a result, Margolin has been playing a hooker in her spare time (among other things) in order to kill off all the descendants of the men who so cruelly syphilisized her once-virginal grandmother. How hitchcockian (look it up) is that? The finale then shamelessly rips off the Mount Rushmore scene from &#34;North By Northwest&#34;, except that the love-interest is a killer and she doesn&#39;t get saved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie also offers some dubious/off-kilter dialog and some not-so great acting. Check out the silly and obvious way in which Napier follows Scheider at the cemetery. Let&#39;s also not forget the moronic plot-device of Napier reaching for his jacket and holding his hand very suspiciously - but it wasn&#39;t a gun! How brilliant! Napier in the tower: now, there&#39;s another string of illogical behavioural patterns. J. Demme was, is, and always will be a director without style, without flair, and the man who directed &#34;Philadelphia&#34;. Let&#39;s give him another Oscar!

First of all, let me say that this is not the movie for people looking to watch something spirited and joyous for the holidays. This movie is cold, brutal, and just downright depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a grinchy mom who is down on Christmas because her husband has lost his job, they are losing their house, can&#39;t buy Christmas presents for the kids, etc. You get the idea, happy stuff for the holidays. So along comes Harry Dean Stanton as Gideon the Christmas angel, who in his dark hat and long overcoat comes off more like a pedophile who hangs around children all day observing them. What better way to instill the spirit of Christmas in Mary Steenburgen than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop looks more like a haven for refugee Nazis on the lam. The movie lays everything on so thick that you don&#39;t care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable. I&#39;m sure this film wanted to be something Capra-like, but it left out the joy and sentiment on what a holiday film should be.

This isn&#39;t one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology, or being dated, issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with, but rather a review on the story telling, which most of us are truly interested in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is about a combination of WWII Allied and German Navy members, and two civilians (the hero and heroine), who are thrust together on a German U boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manipulations aren&#39;t so bad by film standards, and we know from the plot that realism isn&#39;t going to be high. What films like this need are credible and likable characters, along with some semblance of reason in the actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film lacks both. For a full length film, only 6 characters are given any time, and 3 of them are barely looked into. McClure&#39;s hero is beyond &#34;routine&#34;, and doesn&#39;t make much sense in any era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered, but the riddle is not much of a riddle, and we could care less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of failure in a film that should have been better, even for its time.

A squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull-riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks&#39; desert-spread in Arizona, where government suits have just invested in the family&#39;s herd of cattle (which is in dire need of a stud). What director Peter Tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills, though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages (his social commentary isn&#39;t exactly pointed, but Tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes). Despite colorful supporting turns by Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the general wackiness gets way out of hand, and there&#39;s too much hoopin&#39; and hollerin&#39; to sustain much interest. As for Elvis, he&#39;s loose and frisky throughout--and while it&#39;s nice to see him having fun on-screen, one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point. This shambles of a picture has a distinct what-the-hell feel to it, and though spirits are high, the returns are mostly low. *1/2 from ****

BEGIN SPOILER: Fitfully funny and memorable for Mr. Chong&#39;s literal roach-smoking scene: Chong coolly mashes a stray kitchen cockroach into his pipe&#39;s bowl, lights up, coughs and hacks violently for a seeming eternity,then with perfect aplomb and not skipping a beat, re-loads the bowl properly, re-lights, re-tokes. END SPOILER. Alas, I began to lose faith less than half-way through the proceedings. It occurred to me that the lackadaisical duo are way obnoxious and less than relatable. I have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners, Harold and Kumar. I simply prefer brighter company. Yet, the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bros or those viewers who are so feeble-minded as to be outwitted by a stoner when they-- the former are sober. Notable guest appearance by Paul Reubens spouting obscenities in pre-Pee-wee form.

I attended a screening of &#34;Fierce People&#34; at the 2006 Woodstock Film Festival. I hesitate to label it a &#34;premiere&#34; of any sort, since it was shot in the spring of 2004 and had its world premiere at Tribeca in 2005. It played several festivals that year. Release seemed imminent, then it disappeared. Poof. Vanished. Or so it appeared to the film-going public. Rumors of a theatrical or DVD release have popped up now and then, but all proved unfounded. Then this screening was announced. Perhaps one can call it a &#34;re-premiere?&#34; It certainly felt as if I was witness to a buried treasure. And what a treasure it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose one could characterize &#34;Fierce People&#34; as a coming-of-age drama. But it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as mystery. And a bit of farce thrown in. In short, real life. That makes it hard to pigeonhole, which puts it more into the category of an indie as opposed to a Hollywood movie. But its high production values, big budget feel, and star caliber cast seem at odds with the indie label. So let&#39;s call it a hybrid. And, perhaps, that&#39;s why it&#39;s been &#34;lost.&#34; It defies categorization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin), 15, whose father is absent. In fact, Finn has never known him. But he sees him and hears him via the collection of home movies sent from South America. Dad is a renowned anthropologist, and has made a name for himself by setting up shop with the Yanomani, the tribe of &#34;Fierce People&#34; who live to kill and, well, procreate. All their activities are built around those two &#34;tasks,&#34; and Finn is captivated by it. Mom Liz (Diane Lane) is also somewhat absent. Although present physically, she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol. So Finn becomes an adult in his little solitary world with his reels of film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One summer, Mom decides to drag Finn along with her into the wilds of New Jersey. A massage therapist, Mom has catered to a wealthy client, Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland, in a tour de force performance) and he has invited her for an extended house call at his palatial estate. Osborne&#39;s &#34;tribe&#34; includes an assortment of eccentric rich kids, servants, and village idiots among whom Finn will find himself part of his own anthropological study. Will his experience with Dad&#39;s films help him survive life as a visitor to this tribe? Will he be accepted? Or will he be seen as an outsider, concurrently struggling with his own identity as an adolescent? Such is the stuff of fairy tales, and I suppose this would be if not for the dark underbelly which director Griffin Dunne and writer Dirk Wittenborn have infused into this magnificent story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Anton Yelchin&#39;s voice-over, intercutting pieces of Dad&#39;s home movies, Finn must learn to go back to being the teenager he never really had a chance to be, stop being the parent to his Mom, allow newly-sober Mom to be parent to him, and learn responsibility on the way to adulthood the way it should have taken place all along. Yet he needs to make this transformation in a dangerous, dark world where playing with fire is folly to this fractured family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, first and foremost, a story-driven film and Griffin Dunne emphasized as much in the intro to the film. He bought the rights to Wittenborn&#39;s novel even as it was being written, and Wittenborn&#39;s own screenplay comes to life in the hands of the masterful Dunne in a way that&#39;s a work of wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also largely a character-driven film, and Sutherland has never been better. His star turn as Osborne stunned those around me and will likely leave you amazed as well. Diane Lane&#39;s character ultimately exhibits so many personalities that it&#39;s hard to imagine another actor pulling it off so well. She is breathtaking. But more than anything, &#34;Fierce People&#34; is Anton Yelchin&#39;s film. He has a long resume as a child actor but preciously little as a teen. Other than the little-known &#34;House of D&#34; (also a gem), he is best known as Byrd on TV&#39;s &#34;Huff.&#34; In January, he will be seen in &#34;Alpha Dog&#34; (also sitting on the shelf since 2004, a film I saw at Sundance this year and in which he is the &#34;heart and soul&#34;). His performance here goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young, and is nothing short of spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This complex, quirky film has remained out of sight long enough. &#34;Fierce People&#34; is a treasure filled with light and shadow, comedy and tragedy, joy and pathos, but mostly wonder.

when i saw commercials for this i was thinking &#34;NO WHAT HAS NICK AT NITE DONE!&#34; because it was taking up &#34;fresh prince&#34; slots. well, i still love the fresh prince. but george lopez is a surprisingly good show. i love how not-stereotypical benny is. carmen is a pretty good character, its really funny to see how stupid and overemotional she can be sometimes. i feel bad for the guy who plays max, he looks much younger then he actually is! but max is a fun character, and acted well. and yeah, angie is a little stereotypical, but she has her funny moments. ha ha george does have a big head! nah but he can be really good too. funny show! it definitely should be on more often then home improvement.

This is not the worst film I have seen of Peter Greenaway but it is close. That dishonor goes to the even worse Pillow Book. This director&#39;s films of 3 I have seen I find them all to be miserable. Like The Cook...,whatever positive cinematic flourishes he displays, are totally unredeemed by the repugnancy of his material and overall presentation.

Every movie from the thirties is dated, but if you were to watch only John Ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others. i.e. Grand Hotel is comparatively modern melodrama. With Ford, there&#39;s always the hard-sell of someone&#39;s nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always the over-emphasis of some heavy&#39;s badness. Always the poorly crafted, awkward and obvious scripts. This is no exception. It&#39;s just a rather belabored device to deliver sentiment. And sentiment is all this has going for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Ford does here doesn&#39;t make me appreciative of Lincoln, it just makes me wonder how the States were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here. Ford went on to make decent movies. This is too dated to be anything but bad. It feels entirely false. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry Fonda with a fake nose is bizarre. And no one from Illinois would pronounce the trailing &#39;S,&#39; or say &#34;Shonuff!&#34;

Hunt for Justice is about the setup of Slobadon Milosevic for his trial in the Hague. While it was a little too clinical in presentation the subject matter could have gotten very depressing very quickly. A Canadian Judge, Louise Arbour, becomes the Chief War Crimes Prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the UN in Yugoslavia. She battles everyone to pull out the evidence that sent Milosevic to trial. Not a bad docu-drama with class A directing and production work. The &#39;evidence&#39; was disturbing by the shear discussion of the facts, happily they didn&#39;t go into too much detail and no real pictures of the tortured.

&#34;A little nonsense now and then, is cherished by the wisest men.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are too smart to watch this movie, then you are too smart to be alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful romp, wonderful premise, period piece done with acute eye for detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - et al - just wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rent it, sit down, relax, take it in, smile a little. Enjoy yourself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, thank me.

I just saw &#34;Behind Bedroom Doors,&#34; and this was the first softcore flick with a solid story behind it that I&#39;ve seen in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We begin with two neighborly couples--Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington), and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian appears to be a housewife, James is a lawyer running for district attorney, Lillian works in real estate, and Gabe is a successful plastic surgeon. Got all that? Now, let&#39;s get into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Abby, played beautifully by porn star Chelsea Blue. She&#39;s renting the house across the street from the Fenways and lives all by herself. At the beginning of the movie, James looks out his window and sees Abby engaged in playtime with her girlfriend, Gigi (played by prolific pornstress Monique Alexander) and secretly begins to wonder what it would be like to be with her. The next day, Abby gets acquainted with all four of them, and appears to be a nice woman who just happens to be living an alternative lifestyle. She makes a pass at Vivian, who seems startled and says to her, &#34;Oh...I&#39;m...not that way.&#34; Everything seems okay...until the plan gets set in motion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Abby shows up at Gabe&#39;s office, naked, asking Gabe if she should get a boob job. This is where we get our quote of the movie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Tell me about Gabe.&#34; &#34;What do you want to know?&#34; &#34;Is Gabe happily married?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m married.&#34; &#34;There&#39;s trouble.....let me guess. Your wife stays at home, and does everything you ask. But, she&#39;s a good girl.&#34; &#34;Yes.&#34; &#34;She&#39;s not a bad girl?&#34; &#34;No.&#34; &#34;Does that door have a lock on it?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know what happens next....Abby gets it on with Gabe, right there in the exam room. After that, she puts on a little show in her window for James, who comes over and wastes no time in having sex with her. What James doesn&#39;t know is that the teddy bear on the piano with the flashing red eye is really a camera taping all the festivities (it&#39;s so obvious anyway). Abby has sex with Gabe again later, and this time Gigi joins in to make it a three-way. Now that Abby has something on both men, she requests $100,000 from each in order to buy her silence. Not only could she ruin James&#39;s run for office, but she could destroy Gabe&#39;s practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Gabe and James wrestle with their guilt, Abby finds time to seduce Lillian--who &#34;experimented&#34; with women in college. That was a long time ago, but you wouldn&#39;t know that seeing her in action with Abby--she looked like an old pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Gigi goes along with the plan, she&#39;s seems jealous of all the sex her girlfriend is having. &#34;It&#39;s only business,&#34; Abby says. Confessions and apologies are sure to follow, as is some startling info on Abby&#39;s true identity--it seems she&#39;s been doing the same thing to different men in many different places. Gabe and James use this info to fight back against Abby&#39;s blackmail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to the sex. The sex scenes were pretty good, and considering all the women involved in this film except for Julia Kruis have a lengthy porn background, I wouldn&#39;t have expected anything less. Nicole Sheridan&#39;s four scenes were the best of the movie, with the three-way coming in a close second. Monique Alexander only got naked once, but she was a relatively minor character. Julia Kruis was a major character and got naked the same number of times. I suppose since she was surrounded by experienced hardcore pros, she didn&#39;t have to have as many sex scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To wrap up, &#34;Behind Bedroom Doors&#34; had a great storyline, which enhanced the overall grade of the film. I consider it tapeworthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good in this film--better than her later offerings in Fred Olen Ray&#39;s comedies. At least she can do drama somewhat. Chelsea Blue was a scene stealer--she wasn&#39;t that bad as the antagonist. I&#39;d give her an A all by herself. Julia Kruis was her usual self. I wish Monique Alexander had more face time in this film, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sex: B (Solid, very solid sex scenes. Nicole Sheridan&#39;s performances were almost hardcore quality. Chelsea Blue looked good in her scenes, too. The two girl-girl offerings weren&#39;t scorching, but they did warm up the screen.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Story: B+ (I liked the dialogue and the main storyline. Chelsea Blue&#39;s performance was good for the genre, and I was impressed with Nicole Sheridan&#39;s turn at drama.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: B (This was a nice softcore flick. I&#39;m glad I was able to watch this one, as I was pleasantly surprised. If Chelsea Blue ever wanted to do more of these, she&#39;d be welcome anytime. That goes for Nicole Sheridan, too--even though she&#39;s probably better at doing comedy. I don&#39;t mind hardcore girls who can act doing softcore films.)

one of the worst films I have EVER seen, but extremely funny (not on purpose though). Every scene that contains anything to do with; aircraft, romance, script or acting is badly messed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this film for all pilots, it´s so bad that you should burst into laughter at some point in the film (also see Airport 79:the Concorde, for the same reason).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone else, avoid this film like the plague (except for fans of B-movies, of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;enjoy

Certainly one of the dozen or so worst movies ever released in any form, featuring a bizarrely abominable performance by Rain Joan of Arc Phoenix (River&#39;s sister, inevitably), as Bonanza Jellybean plus inconceivably awful voiceover narration by Tom Robbins, the author of the novel, which had/retains its peculiar sweet/loopy charms.

&#34;Home Room&#34; came as a total surprise. Not having a clue as to what it was all about, it paid off big time because it doesn&#39;t hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his class mates, who are the innocent victims of his rash actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Ryan, the director, who is working and editing his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia Browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school. She has been away a couple of years and doesn&#39;t seem to be in the same wave length of the other students. For one, she is a rebel with a punk look, lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit. Alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students have died, supposedly killed by her boyfriend. Alicia, we realize, is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life, but we are not given any clues to that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is the aftermath of the tragedy, as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it. Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teen ager who shouldn&#39;t have been at the school, at all. When a ricochet bullet hit her, she is hospitalized with more than a wound. She is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares don&#39;t let her forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal. Since she doesn&#39;t cooperate with the police, the head of the school wants her to see Deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows. Alicia dislikes Deanna, but in a matter of days, both girls will make peace. We don&#39;t realize until the last sequence what really happened that horrible day in school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Busy Phillips makes an excellent Alicia and Erika Christiansen is equally good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland, and the rest of the cast play as an ensemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film has an intensity because it&#39;s not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred, which helps the tone that Mr. Ryan wanted to give this movie.

Mr Bean was great fun, i loved it, every episode was really funny, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he&#39;s a funny looking bloke and his facial expressions were hilarious!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The series was so successful that they even made a Mr Bean movie in 1997, which was also pretty funny by the way!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s funny seeing all the adventures and situations he gets himself into, this series was a classic for sure, and i still watch an episode from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr Bean is well worth a 10/10 in my book, fans of offbeat comedy must check this out.

Vijay Krishna Acharya&#39;s &#39;Tashan&#39; is a over-hyped, stylized, product. Sure its a one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this one. Why? The films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby. Script is king, without a good script even the greatest director of all-time cannot do anything. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner &#39;Yash Raj Films&#39; and Mega Stars appearing in it. But nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland. Thumbs down! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performances: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor. But how could he okay a role like this? Akshay Kumar is great actor, in fact he&#39;s the sole saving grace. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. She looks stunning and leaves you, all stand up. Saif Ali Khan doesn&#39;t get his due in here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Tashan&#39; is a boring film. The films failure at the box office, should you keep away.

If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece, this ain&#39;t it. If you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good, then this may be for you. There are so many unintentional laughs in this film, that it could almost be considered a comedy. Let&#39;s start with the opening titles, that say &#34;Jack-O&#34;, and then add the word &#34;Lantern&#34;, as if the viewer wasn&#39;t able to figure out the movie was about a pumpkin by the giant pumpkin shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie. After that, the movie goes in about 20 different directions, none of which make much sense. Jack-o is everywhere, he&#39;s in people&#39;s houses, in the woods, and yet he doesn&#39;t ever seem to do much of anything. He does make a few kills, but the long buildup to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish Jack-o would take out his rage on you the viewer. Other than that, the plot consists of poor acting, gratuitous nudity, and a ridiculous plot line. The acting in this film is among the worst I&#39;ve ever seen in my 35 plus years of movie-watching. The boy who is the lead in the film (the director&#39;s son) has about as much emotion as a corpse, and just about all of the other actors/actresses are just as bad for numerous reasons (especially the bug-eyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers). But, having said all this, if you take this for what it is, (that is a steaming pile of dung) then you will get a few laughs from this movie. What I also found amusing is that the makers of the DVD saw fit to release a &#34;10th Anniversary Version&#34; of this movie (as if the original wasn&#39;t good enough). And someone actually had the idea of making a &#34;behind the scenes&#34; mini film which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition (I&#39;m not sure why).......I&#39;ll give this 3 smashed pumpkins out of 10...

This first (and hopefully not last) Wallace &amp; Gromit feature lives up to expectations. There are plenty of jokes (some a bit cheeky) as well as some great tributes to past Science Fiction movies. With the barrage of awful and formulaic movies being spewed forth from Hollywood it&#39;s great to see such a great film like this that&#39;s enjoyable for almost everyone. If there is any justice it will be top of the box-office and be at least nominated for best animation at the next Oscars. The animation is wonderful; the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are great fun. This is one of those films that the whole family can enjoy. Charming, clever, fun and well made, what&#39;s not to enjoy?

One day a red alley cat is fed up of being kicked by people and attacked by dogs and muses that life would be better if he were a skunk. He then paints himself black with a white stripe down his back and adds a bit of Limburger cheese to make him stink. At first life couldn&#39;t be better for him, the dog flees and the butcher abandons his shop letting the cat walk off with a pile of meat. Just as he is thinking everything is perfect he is noticed by a real skunk, not just any skunk but the overly amorous Pepé Le Pew. Pepé mistakes the poor cat for a female skunk and pursues him thinking his protestations are just shyness. Our poor cat thinks he has escaped when he throws a skunk skin from a tall building so that Pepé will think he is dead, at first it seems to work but as he sneaks off Pepé sees him and instantly forgets the dead skunk. In the end the cat realises he was better off being kicked and attacked than being lusted after by a randy skunk... there is a nice ending for the skunk too when his wife finds out what he has been up to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a fairly funny introduction to Pepé Le Pew who back then was just overly amorous but now looks like a randy sexually harassing stalker, although he was punished for his behaviour in the end.

In short:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spike Lee clearly has a lot on his mind. He&#39;s thinking about racism color-ism, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, &#39;hetero-sexism&#39;, politics of the drug war etc etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That level of consciousness on is own is great. I think it is a blessing that more and more people are choosing to critically examine fundamental aspects of our daily lives; the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. However, just because Lee is making contentious films does not make him a good film-maker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What comes across in &#34;Jungle Fever&#34; is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely the result of two main failures:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;firstly, Lee is simply trying too hard. He seems to be desperately trying to accommodate every political/social statement he can think of into the 90mins. And as such, the end result seems confused and irresolute as he allows himself no time to develop characters that can fully embody the ideas he hopes to present. And so he exhausts stereotypes and we are left with rushed testimonies and very loaded dialogs. The end result is very staged and unrealistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, by attempting to make statements about such a wide variety of societal functions, he appears to have no concrete or original interpretation of the social/political issues presented. What comes across is a puddle of regurgitated non-sense. You feel that he bought an elementary level sociology text book and spewed out all 500 pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are highly problematic features because the artistry of film is sacrificed and the work is transformed into a loudspeaker for the voice of the voice of the filmmaker. He is unable to distance himself from the work, and allow it to speak for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It functions neither as a piece of art nor a sound political argument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I still do appreciate Lee bringing up these important issues, I must say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs down.

The French people are not known to be great movie producers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though their Amelie scores high points at the Oscars. Asterix et Obelix is a very different film of what I am used to from the French. It is a great movie especially for kids. The only thing that boddert me was that it was spoken in French and subtiteld. Normally with the english spoken movies (here in the Netherlands) I don&#39;t have to read the subtitles. But with the French language you just have to read to understand. The story it self is just great with Obelix who doesn&#39;t recall him self of beïng fat, but there also nice details mainly in names like brucewillix and malcomix. You all know the story from the comic books and this movie shows all most slide by slide the book. Every thing is in it, from the Sfinx nose braking till pirate red beards lose of three more ships. I would say a great movie for the weekend with the children.

I knew this would be one of the worst movies I could have imagined...but in just 20 short minutes it actually exceeded my low expections by being possibly THE worst movie I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already wasted too much time typing about it...trust me, it sucks.

Oh Mr. Carell! How far you&#39;ve fallen! After a glowing moment in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, Steve Carell&#39;s choice of films is beginning to contrast starkly with what has come since. Although THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN was entertaining, it was dwarfed by his &#34;Sunshine&#34; character. Hoping to find something that&#39;d get me to spew popcorn from my nose, I decided to rent EVAN ALMIGHTY and see what possible guffaws might await me here. Not much...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the trite and clichéd script, the entire film felt forced and unemotional. Poking a bit of fun at flagging family values and the current U.S. administration&#39;s take on the environment, Evan Almighty also tries to put a profound biblical moment into humorous terms but fails miserably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly every person on Earth knows the story of Noah and The Ark. God&#39;s wrath was sent down with 30 days and nights of rain which flooded the entire planet while Noah, his family, and two of each of His creatures on Earth rode out the wetness in relative comfort via the gopher wood ark. It was a huge moment in human history (if you believe the biblical text).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why would God appear to one man and ask him to build an ark that would only carry the world&#39;s animals for a few minutes after a dam break? The simple answer is that He never would. Too much emphasis was given to U.S. government policy and not enough on world events, making Evan Almighty a terribly myopic and Ameri-centric film. Although designed as a comedy, it really never reaches anything approaching belly laughs. Maybe a few grunts and a smile, but little else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Goodman (CARS) pulls in another forced performance as the despicable Congressman Chuck Long who&#39;s only goals are to create development opportunities on protected national land holdings. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 ITEMS OF LESS) as God can&#39;t help mop up this soaking wet disaster-of-a-film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only funny moments are between Carell and the animals, especially as Evan learns what animal magnetism is REALLY like. Birds literally flock to him. Sheep herd around him. Lions take pride in being near him (please forgive the puns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The special effects were fun to watch but were brief (with good reason). The &#34;flood&#34; was interesting in that the Ark was obviously guided by His hand and shoved in just the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that you&#39;re in for little more than an insult to common sense and intellect.

This movie is truly unbelievable, in every sense of the word. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing, and hearing, and I didn&#39;t believe it anyhow. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but this was ridiculous. Being a hillbilly myself, I know what it should sound like, and it&#39;s not Kate&#39;s Back Bay accent. The only thing I found funnier was the fact that the guy who played Charlie Chan so many times, Sydney Toler, was cast as another one of the hillbillies, with accent to match. Maybe this was a practical joke, come to think of it. I can think of no other reason for such peculiar casting. Well, maybe this. I noticed that Natalie Schaefer, Lovey Howell on Gilligan&#39;s Island, appeared in this play on Broadway. Can you imagine what part she might have played?

I found &#39;Shuttle&#39; an incredibly frustrating film to watch. It starts quite well and moves along briskly until the first &#39;injury&#39; (which is a doozy). After that it becomes very lazy and underwritten as a story. It was the case of the plot driving the characters and not the characters driving the plot. If you hate film where you can&#39;t understand why characters do what they do, you will loathe &#39;Shuttle&#39;. Particularly, the last act is odd and seems to occur in a world without common sense. Also at the end one of the characters confessed a past misdemeanor to her friend, rather than generating sympathy from the audience, most people started to giggle. This was probably because the &#39;heroines&#39; of the story was a complete idiots. Finally there is an ending which just seems tacked on to be &#39;shocking&#39; and comes from the horror cop-out school of &#39;people are bad, audience, so just accept it without any explanation&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Shuttle&#39; is neither good or bad, but mediocre. And annoying.

It is not obvious from viewing this film (so I recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it) but this presentation on the realities of Islam, and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non-Muslims is lacking objectiveness, and also completely fails to factor in the human condition. It is one thing to document that the Koran says many things about how a devout Muslim is required to interact with non-Muslims, but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of Islam, will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system. There is reason to call much about the presenters into question, such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism; don&#39;t swallow it all, hook, line, and sinker, without some thinking of your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One specific, for instance, is researching the person Walid Shoebat; who claims to be a former Muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions. I am not nor have I ever been a Muslim. I have never read the Koran. I am not a Christian, nor a member of _any_ faith. But I am an intelligent and discerning human. While the film is quite disturbing, in its presentation of how SOME Muslims view their obligation to Islam; I remind you that there is more to Islam than the views of the fundamentalists. Just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical Christians, so, too, there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among Jews and Muslims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you watch this film, you need to have the salt shaker on hand. One grain will not be enough, you&#39;ll need more. Please use your own mind and think for yourself, research what is presented, and evaluate the state of the world and how Islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video. There is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together, indicating a definite bias. Be your own brain.

I could not believe the original rating I found when i looked up this film, 9.5? Unfortunately it looks like I am not alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film, is slow and boring really, one of the sad things is that if the film had been given a realistic rating of around 5 or 6 then the expectation would not have been so high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this was not the case, so when watching the film, and seeing the poor story and acting, I am left giving it a 3/10 score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vinnie Jones is superb in Lock stock, and also Snatch, and he plays a great hard man, however, he should stick to this role. Its a bit like when Stallone and Schwarzenegger have done comedy films, they just don&#39;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither can he play lead actor, he plays better as supporting or otherwise. When he plays lead, his acting talents are too &#39;in view&#39; and shown up as not really very good. Mean Machine is another good example of this.

This movie is simply wonderful! It&#39;s got it all: laughter, sorrow, beauty, poetry, truth. All in a simple yet intense story--like life! You won&#39;t get distracted for a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Somebody tell Hollywood you need a good story to make a good movie, and there are so many good stories out there.

planktonrules comments must&#39;ve been written on Topsy-Turvy Day, because everything stated by that simple life form is the opposite of real truth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Bluebeard&#39;s Eighth Wife&#39; is hilarious in every scene, in every way -- the chemistry between Colbert and Cooper could not have been finer...supporting cast is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing and direction are magnificent!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like so many other comments on this board again I lament, &#34;Why can&#39;t films be like this anymore?&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is classic Paramount 1930&#39;s screwball comedy at its best, folks!

I was trying to work out why I enjoyed this film?? Its not because of money spent on it that&#39;s for sure!! Did I see a painted water pistol in there? Maybe they don&#39;t have the same sort of visual effects houses in the Scotland? Or maybe they just didn&#39;t have any money? The making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds. Awesome! But what I really liked was the grit of the performances. Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead parts like 2 normal guys. No Hollywood histrionics here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so the effects work isn&#39;t very good. The spaceships just don&#39;t look as good as they should in todays FX world and I&#39;ve seen much better free stuff on youtube. But the film holds together very well once they get to the Planet. Was this filmed in Scotland or just by a Scottish crew? Or is it just better effects work? Did they edit out the water? By the end I kinda loved this film and was disappointed when they all died.

A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man. Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempting artiness with black &amp; white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent. Very little music or anything to speak of. The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head. He goes to a used record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two sales clerks before they find the album. Cute scene gave promise, but it went downhill from there. The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it&#39;s about emptiness, it works I guess because it&#39;s empty. Wasted two hours.

Too bad neither the animals or Eddie Murphy had anything to say worth saying. this movie is just bland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children&#39;s movie? Well, if you&#39;re trying to get them to take a nap, then maybe. It&#39;s just 90 minutes of some eye-wrenchingly poor animal lip animation to quips that aren&#39;t funny. And the lip-sync&#39;ing makes the old Godzilla films look brilliantly done by comparison. Meanwhile, Eddie &#34;Pluto Nash&#34; Murphy drones on with a suppressed understated delivery that is painful to experience. Apparently, he&#39;s trying to modify his old manic persona, but to what? In short, all the magic and wonder of the 1967 original version is lost in this re-imagining, or whatever it is. A town wants to bully some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad stuff. No, really. And Pluto Nash can psycho-babble with them. Things chain along with some stale jokes to a dull uninspired conclusion with no surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rent the &#39;67 movie. Or some old Yogi Bear cartoons.

I remember seeing this in a the Salem movie theater (where I used to attend &#34;Kiddie Matinée&#34;s almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio when I was a young boy and have never forgotten it. It simply amazed me and my friends. I do wish there were some way I could see it again! I have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail. I only recently discovered that it was a Cousteau film and that blew my mind even more. How the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding. The fish is ACTUALLY IN THE CAT&#39;S MOUTH at one point, if I remember correctly! If anyone could help me find a way to see it again I would be extremely grateful!

Well, were to start? This is by far one of the worst films I&#39;ve ever paid good money to see. I won&#39;t comment on the story itself, it&#39;s a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a soap opera. To start with, the acting, except for Eric Bana, is soap opera quality. I&#39;ve always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every actor on The Bold and the Beautiful puts him to shame. The camera action doesn&#39;t help, either. How it lingers on him when he&#39;s thinking, it just takes me back to Brooke Forrester&#39;s days in the lab! Peter O&#39;Toole has either had a really bad plastic surgery, or he is desperately in need of one. Either way, he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And to end my comments, Diane Kruger is a cute girl, but she sure is no Helen of Troy. Peterson should rather have chosen Saffron Burrows for the role, since Elizabeth Taylor would be rather miscast by now.

All y&#39;all hatin&#39; on the fact you&#39;d probably neva make the cut for &#34;Second String&#34; need to save it. If more guys out there took their sorry behinds to the gym for once...maybe y&#39;all have a chance....well,...maybe. Take Shawn Woods&#39; &#34;HOOK&#34; physique for a &#34;perfect&#34; example...and I stress the word &#34;perfect&#34; Put that in your pipe and smoke it...!!! You couldn&#39;t look better Sha-Shawn

I sat through this on TV hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the time...but dear Gussie, whoever thought this script was worth producing? The basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad, with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes, an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor Rock Hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face. Looks like a bad B movie from the 40&#39;s...

I don&#39;t know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this. In fact, it&#39;s a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that&#39;s going on behind the walls of the stadium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes you feel like you are in the movie and you&#39;re one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match. You will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie. It&#39;s gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending, you will want to find out the verdict, you&#39;ll be dying to see what will happen to the girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee. It&#39;s like venus VS mars, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and am looking forward to watching some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am already hooked with Iranian movies and this one is a must-see!

This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen well over 300 movies in my lifetime. The acting atrocious, the only bright spot seems to be judging the anatomical prowess of the female castmembers. After watching this movie, it is suggested that the viewer not operate heavy machinery or go driving for a period of at least 24 hours. Also a bottle of Valium would be recommended so you don&#39;t feel so bad for the 100 wasted minutes of your life. The plot is nothing original, the dialog excruciating, and even the weapons seem sub-par. Do yourself a favor and go to your local Blockbuster and burn whatever copies they have of this horrid film.

Many people remember the Waco standoff that occurred a long time ago. What most people probably have ingrained in their minds is the &#34;cult leader&#34; David Koresh and the images of the compound burning to the ground after a long standoff. A lot of people have the belief that Koresh was some kind of madman who thought he was God. He was accused of being a child molester and was credited for the breakdown and deaths of his followers. Furthermore, many people feel the cult committed mass suicide when the FBI stormed Mount Carmel Center and when the building was burning. Most people feel the cult was at fault for not agreeing with the FBI on reasonable terms. Most people feel the cult was brainwashed by Koresh and followed along with everything that he said. Nothing could be farther from the truth, because of strong evidence after the nightmare was over, and this one-of -a- kind documentary pretty much proves it!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This documentary is one of the most balanced examinations at the situation that occurred. It is much more thorough and highly detailed than anything most people have received in the mainstream media. To the shock of many people, this documentary will reveal that is was the ATF, the FBI, and the higher levels of the United States government who were the ones who were unjust, cruel, and deceptive, and not David Koresh and his followers. What Korseh and Davidians were doing was just protecting their constitutional rights, and the higher powers completely violated and raped those rights. The AFT had no grounds to storm the compound; it was the AFT that shot first and they shot from the helicopters from above at unarmed men, women, and children!! What is even more shocking is the actions of the FBI when they entered the Mount Carmel. Watch it for yourselves and you will develop and new perspective on the U.S. government. There is infrared footage that clearly shows the FBI was shooting with machine guns at the men, women, and children in the burning compound. It will make your blood boil. It will make you really angry. It will make you wonder as to what kind of people run this country. Finally, it will make you wonder as to what you are being told on the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This video is frightening and I highly recommend it if one can find it. This documentary does not need to be purchased; it can be watched for free on google video!

Joseph Conrad&#39;s novel, Heart of Darkness, had a vivid sense of description that made this book astonishing. When reading this book I had every scene totally drawn out in my head and I knew what every character looked like. This book had many pieces and when I finished reading this book it seemed as the puzzle had been completed. After I finished reading Heat of Darkness, I watched the movie, which was a mistake. The movie cut out so many substantial parts. For example, in the novel Marlow waited a very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat. This was a big source of futility. In the movie that part was just left out. The movie added more parts that were useless and made no sense. For example, when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz snapped the monkey&#39;s neck and killed him. What purpose did that scene have, other than to make the audience feel sorry for the monkey? It&#39;s as if the script writer didn&#39;t even read the whole book and just put the parts that he read in the movie. If I had not read the novel before I had watched the movie I would have been thoroughly confused. The book was amazing and it is truly a classic in American Literature, but the movie could have defiantly been nominated for the worst picture in the Razzie Awards.

I voted excellent for how well the acting was, not for the content. It still gives me chills after reading the book, then watching the movie. Two ex-cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison. During the ride, the tension begins to mount, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation. After the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family&#39;s remains are found by the daughter&#39;s church friend. The blood-curdling scream, as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord, really made my blood run cold and gave me chills. That the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family. Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote.

The plot:Kurt Harris (Jeff Wincott), a bitter, ex-cop goes undercover in the &#34;Peacemakers&#34; after his friend is killed by their leader. While there, he discovers that the woman wants to run for mayor, and will do anything to achieve this goal, even murder.The cast is good(Jeff Wincott is a good martial artist and good actor)...Brigitte Nielsen plays a sexy antagonist together another bad guy plays Matthias Hues also him good martial artist.The direction is good(the fight scenes also).The rest is OK, with Tony Burton who plays a friend of Kurt killed from Nilsen,and Cyndi Pass plays a bad girl.From producers of another action/martial arts film(Bounty Tracker with Lorenzo Lamas)a good action film.The best film of Martial Law series.

I agree with all aforementioned comments. This show was a delight to watch. Funny, witty, terrific acting and zany sets. It&#39;s always a thrill to find a show that is smartly written, assumes the audience has brains and displays subtle humor. I would spend good, hard-earned cash money to see it again on DVD. And as long as we&#39;re requesting Smart Series That Never Got a Chance...How about DVD releases of Maximum Bob (another well written, odd duck show with a delightful cast of characters.) And add to the list...Middle Ages or Frank&#39;s Place. There has to a way to release these shows out of the vaults and into the hands of devoted fans and new audiences.

I would like if they brought back surface. I really enjoyed the show along with my family. I felt the plot development and storyline were first rate. Like the other person said, it seems that everything gets reduced to the lowest common denominator. Nothing but bland, politically correct junk survives. Just look at the internet to see how many people were watching the show. Also it is not nice to leave us hanging as to what happened the all of the characters on the show. This is the same thing that happened to the time travel show I think was called 8 days but should have been called backstep. Did the Olympics kill surface? I know the writers strike killed another one of my favorite shows years ago called greatest American hero.

What? You were not aware that Scooby-Doo battled zombies? Well, you might also not be aware of this little film that was directed by Victor Halperin, who had also directed White Zombie four years earlier. That would probably make it the second zombie film made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, don&#39;t go looking for Dorothy Stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie films, and don&#39;t even look for any brains being eaten. This is 1936, you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what you will see is typical of the period - lots of talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do get to see Dean Jagger (Twelve O&#39;Clock High ) and Bela Lugosi&#39;s eyes, but that is about it. Zombies in Cambodia, indeed!

A sweet and totally charming film, Shall We Dansu? made me laugh and cry. At first appearance, Sugiyama-san was not terribly appealing--an uptight salaryman, seemingly devoted to his family, but all too easily captivated by a face in a window. The object of his obsession is distant and cold. But by the end of the movie, I was in love with him, her, his wife and daughter, all the dance instructors and dance students. This uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a little jewel that I would enjoy seeing again.

I would have to say this is a great movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Judge has an eye forseeing things that nobody would ever notice hence Office Space. Hemakes a statement about the dumbing down of society and that survival of the fittest is mere pipe dream in 500 years. That pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy companies tend to rule the day. Yes there is a lot of potty humor in it and it is to get the story moving and his point across. But the genuine frustration on Private Joe Bowers face is priceless and some cases we can all relate to it at some point in our lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not enjoy the humor then look at it from a different point of view and watch it again. It took me watching it twice to really appreciate this film for what it isAnd with said after watching it twiceI am going to read a book now.

in this movie, joe pesci slams dunks a basketball. joe pesci...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and being consistent, the rest of the script is equally not believable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pesci is a funny guy, which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar, but the other roles were pretty bad. the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, which wasn&#39;t even well-played. instead of the man being an archetypal villain, he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs. then there&#39;s the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something...i don&#39;t even remember...she was that forgettable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film, or at least one of those millions of media minions who can&#39;t critique efficiently (you know, the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stay away...far away. and shame on comedy central, where i saw this film. they usually pick better.

In August Days/Dies d&#39;agost Marc Recha has given us a sun-saturated Catalan documentary-style road movie that&#39;s mostly a meandering improvised meditation on brotherhood and reclaiming the dead. The beautiful sometimes large-scale, richly atmospheric 35 mm. landscape images, nice soundtrack and Catalan-language narration are enchanting as a mood piece, if one is content with a trajectory that hasn&#39;t much momentum and doesn&#39;t lead anywhere in particular. Filmmaker Marc Recha and his non-identical twin David are the stars and the narrative is voiced by their younger sister. Marc had been researching the life of Ramon Barnils (1940-2001), a socialist editor who had been a family friend. He felt he was saturated with information and had to take a break. The break turned into making this film, which seeks to capture the mood of the interviews with Barnils&#39; associates, thoughts about the Spanish Civil War, the drought season they were experiencing, the rugged landscape, the Recha brothers&#39; affection for each other, swims and suntanned nudity and whatever characters or stories they ran into as they camped out of their van. This leads to pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. In the end David has to go back to Barcelona to be with his daughter and Marc has to return to his project, and there it ends. I found it fascinating to listen to an extended narration in the Catalan language with its blend of Spanish and French-sounding words (perhaps linked with Provençal?). This isn&#39;t a major film but it commands attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing around with genres and blending autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thought-provoking way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An official selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center.

This film is, quite simply, brilliant. The cinematography is good, the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is completely convincing - so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on TV some years later, I recognised him from Kline&#39;s portrayal. Denzel Washington also turns in a masterful performance, as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I urge you to watch this. It is long, but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story. Remember, folks, this really happened.

I can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst Laurel &amp; Hardy&#39;s. For me, it isn&#39;t as close to as bad as &#34;Air Raid Wardens&#34; and &#34;The Bullfighters&#34;, but there are some definite huge flaws in it. The film is set up to show Laurel and Hardy as the owners and instructors of the dance studio. Hardy is funny as the prancing lead of a &#34;London Bridge&#34; dance, surrounded by 20th Century Fox starlets, while in the next room, Laurel teaches the beginners ballet while wearing a ballerina outfit. A clumsy carpenter spills glue on the floor, leading to a predicable gag where Hardy ends up the looser. Then, in come the racketeers, now selling insurance covering up their protection racket. One of them is a very young and handsome Robert Mitchum. But no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance, they are arrested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio. The rest of the film is devoted to Laurel and Hardy&#39;s support of wealthy patron Trudy Marshall and her inventor boyfriend, Robert Bailey. They first try to help them hide their relationship from her disapproving parents (Matt Briggs and Margaret Dumont) and hopeful suitor Allan Lane, whom we can tell right off is a no-good swine. This leads to Briggs&#39; hidden bar being revealed to tea-totaling Dumont, and a gag where a rug is literally pulled out from the wealthy patriarch which crashes his bed into a pond below. When Bailey uses the boys to help display his ray gun, pandemonium ensues. The dead-pan butler announces to Case and Dumont that their house is on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, Hardy wants to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hopes to get Laurel to break a leg to do so. There is no reference to the fact that the insurance salesmen were gangsters and that the policy would probably be invalid. (Even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman, after being arrested, their licenses would have been revoked). Laurel ends up getting off a bus which had been abandoned by the driver over a supposedly rabid dog (only a frosting covered, cake devouring Toto look-alike, or possibly the actual pooch), causing Oliver to end up on a huge beach roller-coaster that somehow the bus has ended up on, perfectly fitting its wheels onto the tracks. Roller-coaster gags can be exciting, as evidenced in &#34;Abbott and Costello Go to Hollywood&#34;, and this one is amusing but anticlimactic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the story wraps up, all of these gags seem to have no point, giving the impression that this was simply a series of one-reelers put together to make a full-length feature, hopefully part of a double bill. L&amp;H, as I&#39;ve mentioned in other reviews of their later films, had lost much of their luster after leaving Hal Roach&#39;s employ, but surprisingly here, they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year. Had the gags not been as amusing, as was the case with some of their other films, this surely would have ranked a &#34;2&#34; as opposed to a &#34;3&#34;.

I rented the video of &#34;The Piano Teacher&#34; knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box. I did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at Cannes are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category. About one quarter of the way into it I found myself saying out loud, &#34;This movie is boring.&#34; About half way through I was saying to myself, &#34;Where have I seen this before?&#34; At the three quarters mark I had figured it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of its literary origins, this film is essentially a remake of Robert Altman&#39;s much earlier (1969), and better, &#34;That Cold Day in the Park.&#34; Although the details obviously differ and Altman&#39;s work was more plot-driven and less of a character study, the two films are thematically identical. There is nothing &#34;new&#34; to be seen in this production. Every aspect of it has been done before: a character spiralling out of control with increasingly self-destructive behavior (Abel Ferrara&#39;s &#34;Bad Lieutenant&#34; 1992); a perverse and doomed &#39;love&#39; culminating in an operatic (near) death scene (David Cronenberg&#39;s &#34;M. Butterfly&#34; 1993); uncommonly brutal sex scenes (David Lynch&#39;s &#34;Blue Velvet&#34; 1986); and so on. Hence, I am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be &#34;shocking,&#34; &#34;shattering,&#34; etc. This highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable, and clearly succeeded with some. However, I largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film-viewing experience. See enough movies and you really will, eventually, have seen it all. And while it is true that I saw the expurgated &#39;R-rated&#39; version, I doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of &#34;The Piano Teacher.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically, the film is not without merit. There is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent. Isabelle Huppert&#39;s creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time. This is the first of Haneke&#39;s films that I&#39;ve seen, and if I were to see more I expect I would have the same opinion of him that I have of Ferrara: an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be. Rating: 4/10.

I was raised in a &#34;very Christian&#34; household since birth. I was saved before I saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church. This movie was highly disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years. I used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my mom&#39;s footsteps upstairs. If I didn&#39;t hear her footsteps, I would sneak upstairs to make sure she hadn&#39;t been raptured. I used to pray so hard every night for salvation because I was terrified of Jesus forgetting me. This is definitely not something I will show to my kids until they are much older, if at all. It took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me.

Geordies...salt of the earth characters...bricklayers...beer...Geordies...happy go lucky...adventures working abroad...salt of the earth characters...warm wonderful people...Tyne Bridge (tear in the eye)...brown ale...salt of the earth characters...cute little Red Indians children in Newcastle United tops...emetic...Geordies...salt of the earth characters...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;etc etc etc....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please. This is so poor. And you should know better Timothy Spall. They can&#39;t have paid you that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Jimmy Nail. Well the kindest thing that can be said is that he is every bit as good an &#39;actor&#39; as he is a singer and writer. Come on Jimmy, the joke&#39;s over. &#39;Crocodile Shoes&#39; and &#39;Spender&#39; were very funny, unfortunately I don&#39;t think they were supposed to be. With &#39;Auf Wiedersehen Pet&#39; the opposite applies.

The bipolarity of this movie is maddening. One moment it&#39;s making fun of Latin Americans, American tourists and banana republics in general, the other it wants to be touching, with burned villages and orphans. Even the serious revolutionary hero, becomes a parody of a revolutionary at one point. But the comedy parts aren&#39;t even funny, because it&#39;s so obviously stolen from Star Wars. Yes, Star Wars, the &#34;hero&#34; is basically a rogue with a heart of gold. Add to this stereotypical sounds effects, Latin Americans who speak English with one another, and a villain that just disappears from the story. And whats the point? It&#39;s basically revolution propaganda with no resolution, and no planning (because, there is just no way these people can lead a country). The US government are bad guys, but who&#39;ll make money producing this? Not some poor farmer, that&#39;s for sure.

It gets really bad. The only half-way redeeming quality is the effects from the thousands of bullets used during the film. There are context errors everywhere. The acting is horrible, save Kirk. The story is as holey as the grail, and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself just kills the movie, if it wasn&#39;t already a corpse. So all in all it&#39;s a waste of your life. I would have given this a zero had that been an option on the rating scale.

Well, this might be one of the funniest movies of all time, and Sandy gives a tour-de-force performance! Alas, her career never quite took off, but - at last - she will always be remembered for her three first-rate pictures: &#34;The King Of Comedy&#34;, &#34;Dallas Doll&#34;, and &#34;Without You I&#39;m Nothing&#34;. She dons into different personas from New York socialite to Diana Ross to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in America. Sexy and fierce, tender and sensual, philosophical and melancholic, she convinces the audience in every scene, and she actually IS &#34;really pretty&#34;. Watch this one (if you&#39;re not from Iowa), you&#39;ll certainly enjoy it!!

I hate to say I enjoyed this movie as the subject matter does not lend itself to enjoyment. However, I was moved by the way the family relationships were portrayed and the sincerity of the performances. It was the kind of film I told all my friends and family to experience as a reminder of how important we all are to each other.

I was very impressed with this film from newcomer Dir./Writer Jose Reyes. The cast was excellent. &#34;Jorge Cordoba&#34; executed a powerful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and shocking performance as the lead character of &#34;Rafa&#34;. It&#39;s inspiring to see independent films with this level of talent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes talent, courage, and determination to go out and make a quality film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admire anyone who can take an idea from concept to conception and go the mile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s easy for people to judge young filmmakers more harshly, but I applaud &#34;Jose Reyes&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the talented cast for their successful efforts.

This film has special effects which for it&#39;s time are very impressive. Some if it is easily explainable with the scenes played backwards but the overlay of moving images on an object on film is surprisingly well done given that this film was made more than 94 years ago.

OK, admittedly as an Orthodox woman who LIVES in Boro Park, I&#39;m going to be a little biased against this film. However, it seemed that Boaz Yakin&#39;s sole purpose in making this film was Orthodox-bashing. With our wigs, modest attire, and separate seating, we&#39;re a pretty easy target already. Yakin never made it past the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia off for loving him more than G-d or their parents. Then he deliberately defies his father&#39;s order that he not go swimming because of his poor health. 2. Sonia flips out at her son&#39;s bris. Why would a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It&#39;s hard to believe that she never attended one before. Let&#39;s face it, even Reform Jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays. 3. Was Mendel sleeping during his chosson classes? He&#39;s supposed to satisfy his wife&#39;s passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to have been married for over a year, and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other? A little clue--arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with. Nor will she be shunned by the community if the marriage doesn&#39;t work out. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly, she did not have to go through her lecherous brother-in-law. There are Orthodox female doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia came off as more whiny than sympathetic. Instead of taking control of her life, she sat back and waited for things to happen, and then complained that she didn&#39;t like the outcome. That&#39;s not standing up to one&#39;s environment; that&#39;s pandering to stereotype. Frankly, I think she got what she deserved.

As a big fan of most modern fantasy movies, I was really looking forward to this. I was not familiar with the character, although after hearing some general stories about the style of the comic and good reviews of the movie, I thought I was in for a real treat...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment that the lead character started to talk in his forced husky voice, I could tell straight away that I was not going to enjoy this movie. I found the story weak and predictable, the acting poor, the effects were very good for a small budget film, but did nothing for the overall plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe as a fan of the Comics you may get something more from this, otherwise I would suggest that you skip it and not waste you cinema fare on this boring adventure.

Bah. Another tired, desultory reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, Toni Collette is superb as always (being an actual actress, you see), and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes. There are even a few genuinely funny lines, and the filmwork, score and editing is competent, apart from a bizarre lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, ah, but. Much of the cast seems to be on autopilot, and they are almost all very clearly too old (and in one case too young) for their declared ages. Worse, they are all speaking &#34;Austinese&#34;, that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that couldn&#39;t be further from the way people actually spoke in Austen&#39;s day (think Yosemite Sam, I kid you not). This is particularly sad, considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial &#34;Fakespearan&#34; that Olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And worst of all is Gwyneth Paltrow. She&#39;s only ever played one character in her films, and she stays true to form here, running through her entire range (smirking to sulking) in the first ten minutes, then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film. There is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers, nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, there is very little reason to watch Emma. It&#39;s an amiable enough adaptation, but if you&#39;re going to pack a film full of anacronisms (i.e. an appalingly thin lead who can&#39;t shoot a bow or handle a period accent) then you might as well do it properly, as with the vastly superior &#34;Clueless&#34;.

I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn&#39;t such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they&#39;re meant!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The musical numbers were so imaginative! EVERYONE when watching any film about that period of time will notice men in tights and realise how different it is to today&#39;s attire and how funny we would find today&#39;s male population if they wore tights day in day out! The idea of dedicating a song to butch men dancing in tights was so fresh how can anyone NOT laugh!!! (Plus also, seeing hip-hop rappers doing ballet is always hysterical-as a dancer also, I&#39;ve done ballet and hip hop and danced with men who&#39;ve had to do both....it still cracks me up each time!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this film, if anyone hasn&#39;t seen it yet, don&#39;t listen to the critic above...watch it and then decide for yourself!!!

Much underrated camp movie on the level of Cobra Woman, etc. Photographic stills resemble Rembrandt prints. Sometimes subtle dialog and hidden literate touches found throughout.

This movie displayed more racial hatred of Jews by David Mamet than I have&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have ever encountered in an American film. The sterotypes are so over the top that my ability to continue watching died. I was so disappointed at Joe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mantegna calling a bunch of men ,sitting in a New York Jewish center cleaning weapons ,heros that common sense prevailed and I stopped. I am deeply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disturbed at the concept that Jews are not Americans and &#34;different&#34;. I suggest that Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hatred not a healer of same.

A fascinating look at the relationship of a single father in 1998 and a single mother in 1881, tied together by a time-traveling teenager. Reminded me of &#34;Somewhere In Time,&#34; Richard Matheson&#39;s &#34;Bid Time Return,&#34; as rendered by Christopher Reeves and Jane Seymour.

My complaints here concern the movie&#39;s pacing and the material at hand. While using archival film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting perspective, too often the material selected to highlight simply isn&#39;t very interesting (such as when Goebbels complains about this or that ailment, &amp;tc., or the ad nauseam footage of his small German hometown). Also, the movie crawls along in covering c. 1920-1939 and then steams through the war years. In sum, the film is little better than a History Channel documentary, with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average History Channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details of Goebbels&#39; life. Still, I found it wanting.

Apartmente&#39;L is one of the most interesting movies that I have ever seen. I experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as I was gunning for the two leads to reunite. That never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end. But the ending lends an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie. It is not a movie which people are likely to rewatch but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people. As of now I haven&#39;t rewatched the movie and I don&#39;t think I will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story follows the experiences of a man, Max, who is engaged to be married to Muriel. He remembers his old girlfriend Lisa(he considers this the love of his life) as he listens, by accident, to Lisa talking on the telephone. Thus he tries to find Lisa. Here starts his extremely frustrating search for Lisa. There are many layers to this movie. There are undercurrents of jealousy, vouyeurism and so on. There is also another character called Alice who is involved in the whole confusion. The movie then moves through a whole range of twists and finally leads to an ending which could be interpreted in many ways. It is fascinating how this movie has only four main characters but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique. What I love about the fact is that a movie about obsession, jealousy is done in such a light hearted manner. It has a very fast pace which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience. The main character, Max, has shades of grey and I felt the ending was perfect. I don&#39;t think he is supposed to be a clean character considering the fact he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged and he also has a fling with Alice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The character of Alice is even worse. Her manipulation and her compulsive lying can really irritate viewers(that is the point, I guess). The scene where she breaks down in front of Lucien really shows another facet of her character. It shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lying and the games and she wants to lead a normal life. In the end, she understands that she needs to get away from it all. The ending lends a cynical touch. Because it seems as if Max&#39;s love for Alice is temporary and fake. It is as if to say that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option(i.e Muriel) than to pursue something that is so fleeting(i.e Lisa or Alice). In many ways this is not really a romantic movie but a satire about romance(in a way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performances deserve high praise. Vincent Cassel as Max gives a great performance. He perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure about his engagement. His geeky looks are an added advantage as it fits the character perfectly. But the real star of the movie is Romane Bohringer as Alice. Her nuanced portrayal of a woman who is jealous of Alice and is in love with Max. The scene where she screams &#34;I am a nutcase too&#34; really shows her desperation and her yearning to live a normal life with a man who loves her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw I also thought lesbianism is another interpretation that can be drawn from this movie. Alice&#39;s actions can be explained in many ways. And her unreasonable obsession with Lisa may also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. It may be far-fetched considering she encourages Lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. But I got the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time. She also avoids questions from Lisa regarding a boyfriend. She spends a whole lot of time with Lisa and she is happy during that time. That may lead many to question her sexual orientation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would give it a 9/10. I think it deserves it but I subtracted one because of the rewatchability factor. I think it is a perfect movie otherwise.

The premise of the film was very promising - sort of a gay Napoleon Dynamite type of film. And to be fair, there were some funny moments and funny lines but it really wasn&#39;t very good overall. The script and dialog felt like a local sketch production, full of clichés and scenes that were predictable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there was enough that was amusing, that I stuck around to see how it finished, since there were hints that something special happens at the end. But it seems that either the film ran out of money or the writer ran out of ideas because the ending is extremely abrupt, almost skipping directly from what looked to be the key conflict in the film to the final credits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was very disappointing but not completely unwatchable...

I am a huge fan of the Farcry Game, HUGE fan. It still holds a place in my top-10 games list of all time! The story line was new, fresh... A truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on... or so i thought...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Farcry the Movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise (see Doom: The Movie, and many more...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Video Game begins as the player (Jack Carver) awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an RPG from an unknown soldier. Jack then finds a communication device where (Harlan Doyle) guides him across islands, shipwrecks, jungles, installations and VOLCANOES, to find his (lady friend?) (Valerie Constantine), all the wile battling mutated super soldiers, and genetically enhanced animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Movie plays out very, very differently: 1: There&#39;s a needless 30 mins (1/3 of the movie) of &#34;backstory&#34; before we even get to the &#39;boat blowing up&#39; scene. 2: Jack then walks onto the beach, kills some goons, then drives off... Nothing like the game... 3: There is no communicator with Doyle on the other end... 4: The &#39;Modified Soldiers&#39; look like albinos with singlets on... And there was no mutated &#39;monkey-like&#39; creatures jumping out of the bushes. A part of the Farcry game i enjoyed allot... 5: There is no sun filled beach scenes, no aircraft carrier, no communications stations on huge cliffs, LITTLE reference to any in-game contents (characters/items/vehicles), in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all. 6: The climactic Volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building. 7: There&#39;s an Ending scene... where everyone (except Krieger) live happily ever after... WHAT THE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! If you are a Gamer, you will HATE this movie will all your soul. It is a movie clearly intended for males, so girls, stay away... So if your a male, 12-29 years of age, have never played Farcry, and are not disgusted by directors attempts at porting books/games to the cinema... then this is for you...

When I was very young,on a local tv station,they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturdays.I saw lots of Kung Fu movies on weekends.I remember lots of them.I saw great flicks like Crippled Masters,Blind Fist of Bruce,Kung Fu Zombie,Shaolin Drunken Monk,Rage of the Master,Tattoe Dragon,and...Five Deadly Venoms.I remember the day clearly.Me and my dad had just gotten lunch at Burger King.We were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday.We ran in the house and jumped onto the couch,turned on the set and flicked it onto 56.The usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturday over it.Then under that was the Title of the film.It said Five Deadly Venoms.Then the movie began.I bit into my burger amused with the pre-credit sequence.I loved this movie the minute it came on.My favorite character was the Toad Venom.The plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn&#39;t what lured me...it was the fighting.The fights were so...amazing.I moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the 2 hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended.

I&#39;m Egyptian. I have a green card. I have been living in the US since 1991. I have a very common Arabic name. I&#39;m married (non-American but non-Egyptian, non-Arab wife). I have children who are born in the US. I have a PhD in Cell Biology from the US and I travel for conferences. I make 6 figure income and I own a home in the Washington, DC area. I pay my taxes and outside 1 or 2 parking tickets I have no blemish on my record since I came to this country in 1991. I look more Egyptian than the Ibrahimi character but my spoken English is as good as his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago I was returning from a conference/company business in Spain through Munich Germany to Washington, DC (Home). I was picked up in Munich airport by a German officer as soon as I got off the Madrid plane. He was waiting for me. He was about to start interrogating me until I simply told him &#34;I have no business in Germany, I&#39;m just passing through&#34;. He had let me go with the utmost disappointment. That was nothing compared to what happened at Washington, Dulles airport (Which was not nearly as bad as what happened to Ibrahimi in the movie). The customs officer asked me a couple of questions about the length and purpose of my trip. He then wrote a letter C on my custom declaration form and let me go. After I picked up my checked bag I was stopped at the last exit point (Some Homeland Security crap). I sat there for 3 hours along with many different people of many different nationalities. I was not told the reason for my detainment. I was not allowed to use my phone or ANY other phone. I was feisty at first asking to be told of the reason or let me go but decided to suck it up and just wait and see. I asked if I can call my wife to tell her that I&#39;m going to be late but was told no. When I tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said &#34;hello&#34;, an officer yanked the phone out of hand and threatened me to confiscate it. When I asked about needing to call home because my family is waiting, they said &#34;Three hours is nothing, we will make contact after 5 hours&#34;. When I asked to use the bathroom, an officer accompanied me there. It toilet was funny; I guess it was a prison style toilet that is all metal with no toilet seat. Finally, they called my name and gave me my passport/green card and said you can go. I asked what the problem was, they said &#34;nothing&#34;!! I know it was only 3 hours but I was dead tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the movie, it was very well made. Unlike most movies that involve Arabs and use non-Arab actors who just speak gibberish, this movie the Arabic was 100% correct. I assume the country is Morocco (North Africa).

I normally wouldn&#39;t waste my time criticizing a useless movie such as this. However, I&#39;m off of work this week, so I have plenty of time to wallow in meaningless trivialities. To start, let me say that I frequently enjoy non-commercial, non-mainstream, non-American cinema. (Feel free to click on my user profile for a supporting filmography.) That said, there are plenty of bad movies that are released in countries outside of the U.S. Trust me, I&#39;ve been tortured by hundreds of them. &#34;Lost In Beijing&#34; is one particularly bad film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening half hour is an impressive, non-stop exhibition of moral degeneracy. This film provides some classic morals that belong on the same level as Kim Ki-duk&#39;s &#34;Bad Guy&#34; (2001). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. women actually enjoy being raped; 2. rape should be glorified, praised, and respected; 3. feel free to rape any woman you like, because while your &#34;doing&#34; her she&#39;ll eventually start to like it and reach orgasm; 4. if you&#39;re wife gets raped, make sure you blackmail her rapist for lots of money, but if he doesn&#39;t pay, just repeatedly bang his slut of a wife as compensation; 5. if you&#39;re wife gets raped, be sure to screw and degrade her the next day while playing the role of the rapist, taunting her with lines like, &#34;Did he fu*k you like this?&#34;; 6. if you&#39;re husband is a rapist, just accept it; 7. after you personally get raped, befriend your rapist and hang out with him whenever possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can anyone in their right mind care about any of these characters? They&#39;re nothing more than a bunch of degenerates who not only live their lives in careless ways, but actually revel in their meaninglessness and support each other. Don&#39;t misunderstand me though. I&#39;m very capable of enjoying films that depict lifestyles and morals that are contradictory to my own. &#34;Ichi the Killer&#34; (2001) and &#34;Moonlight Whispers&#34; (1999) are very interesting portrayals of sado-masochism. &#34;Strange Circus&#34; (2005) is an exceedingly perverted play on child sexual abuse. &#34;Marriage Is A Crazy Thing&#34; (2002) is a scathing indictment on traditional marriage. Even religiously-based movies like &#34;Running On Karma&#34; (2003) and &#34;Samsara&#34; (2001) have entertained me on occasion. The difference is that those films actually have some interesting psychological content and character development to them, whereas &#34;Lost In Beijing&#34; has virtually none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s known that people with unorthodox mindsets exist on this planet, but without some kind of character development or psychology behind the acts themselves, you end up with a superficial exposition of despicable behavior. Why, exactly, does Bing Bing eventually befriend and care for her rapist? Why does the wife of a rapist accept his behavior unconditionally? The filmmakers never bothered to tell us. Even the obvious juxtaposition of rich and poor classes was ineptly conceived and in the end served as a mere situational ploy. It all feels too bland and forgettable after the filthy opening half hour subsides. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers here seem to have confused moral ambiguity with complex characterization. The reason you can&#39;t choose which person to root for is because they weren&#39;t developed properly. Don&#39;t think that this movie has complex characters just because they&#39;re not clearly defined. On the contrary, the reason they&#39;re not clearly defined is because we know nothing about them or what they&#39;re thinking. This is hardly a positive attribute of this movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the camera-work and acting are quite good, but everything else just gets duller and duller as the film progresses. You can place this alongside trash like &#34;Turning Gate&#34; (2002), &#34;What Time Is It There&#34; (2001), &#34;Irreversible&#34; (2002), and the aforementioned &#34;Bad Guy.&#34;

Oh man, does this movie ever bite! If you were ever afraid of seeing a rehash of the slasher genre, done as cheap as possible and as cautious at the same time (pc-friendly, means no nudity, a classic element of slasher films) Cut is it. Every cliche is retread without a hint of self-awareness and the acting. Oh, the acting redefines the word horror. I should have known better as the direct Dutch translation of the title would have tipped me off.

This movie is over hyped!! I am sad to say that I manage to watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and anything beyond that, I will have to force myself real hard to sit down and watch the rest of the movie. It&#39;s totally stupid and very fake. The robot in the movie looks like a man wearing those steel suit and the acting is really bad especially the one playing the character Alien.He is totally annoying!! Don&#39;t waste your money watching this sequel to the popular Gen-X Cops. I&#39;d rather sleep or spend my money on some other things rather than watching this movie. 1 out of 10. If possible,I&#39;d give 0.

I just saw Princess Raccoon at the Asian Film Festival in New York. The gentleman who introduced the film congratulated the audience on their fine taste. &#34;You could be at Herbie: Fully Loaded,&#34; he said with a smug smile, &#34;but instead you&#39;re here to watch Seijun Suzuki&#39;s Princess Raccoon.&#34; The audience applauded and cheered. Well let me tell you, I would have rather watched Herbie: Fully Loaded twice in a row. Princess Raccoon, an allegedly whimsical musical based on Japanese folklore, easily qualifies for one of the ten worst films that I have ever seen. It is so wretched that its wretchedness actually makes me dislike other Seijun Suzuki films, which is quite a feat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is such a vast expanse of things wrong with Princess Raccoon that I hardly know where to start. Perhaps its worst faults are being both aggressively unintelligible and mind bogglingly monotonous. If the reels got mixed up or if half of them got lost in shipping the audience would not know the difference. If you don&#39;t believe me I dare you to steal a print and have someone run the reels in random order. If you can tell me which one goes where I will give you every penny I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first third of the film features a mishmash of scenes, songs (including a cringe inducing rap number), and images that don&#39;t seem to be related in any way at all. Horribly integrated computer animation is thrown into the bargain, adding yet another brick to the immense, and rapidly growing, wall of incomprehensibility. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me to learn that the writer wrote down any Japanese folklore that came to mind of on a bunch of note cards, stacked them up, shuffled them, dealt the cards out on a table, and then wrote the script according to their order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About thirty-five minutes into the film some semblance of a plot arrives on the scene. Something about a shape-shifting raccoon princess (in human form) and a regular human falling in love. I hoped that this was be a portent of the film being something other than a series of perplexing scenes, but no such luck. The film continues in the same absolutely baffling manner. I wish I had gotten out then, but I was trapped in the middle of a narrow row. In retrospect it would have been worth the awkward scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m exhausted just thinking about the last couple of reels. I spent every moment hoping and praying that it would be over. Every big dolly move, swell in music, or scene that looked remotely like it was concluding things renewed my hopes that the credits were about to roll. For agonizing minute after agonizing minute it went on. And on and on and on. Finally, after dozens of false alarms, it cut to what I was sure must be an abstract pattern over which credits were about to appear. Then, in defiance of all reason, it cut to another scene. How could I forget? The completely unrelated subplot concerning a ninja being captured, urinated on, and boiled in a soup hadn&#39;t been wrapped up yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m never going to get those 111 minutes back, but you can spare yourself the pain. Unless you want to taint your memory or future enjoyment of great Seijun Suzuki films like Youth of the Beast and Tokyo Drifter do not see Princess Raccoon. I would have rather spent my time vomiting.

i should love this movie . the acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me . the movie makes working class people look low and cheap .the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy . Barbara Stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family . i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it.again the acting was very very good and worth watching . i really don&#39;t like the story line . just a personal preference .thank you

I was looking at the external reviews (Ebert, etc.) for this film and they were all pretty much negative. However, after reading many of them, I noticed that they all made the same point. Critics were upset that the film centers around what appears to be a senseless murder of an autistic child. Certainly, this is a disturbing image. Critics like Ebert want a traditional detective story that uncovers why the killing happened and squarely places blame on the guilty. They want blame to be cast and resolved. Well, that status-quo theme is kind of what the movie is parodying. Just like society, the critics wanted a very quick resolution so they could move on to their next tragic opera. Perhaps there is no simple question to be answered here? There is a whole lot more to what happened then what is on the surface. The film does not seek to rationalize what happens, but rather understand the why. What also steams me so much about these inane reviews is that all they look at in the way of performances is Spacey and Cheadle, who were both great (and generally are). But there are other great performances at work here other than just the two current icons of Hollywood. Gosling gives an incredible performance that really only somebody of his extreme talent could deliver. Somehow, Gosling is able to make the killer of an autistic child sympathetic. This irritates many, I am sure. However, if one watches the film, they see what Leeland&#39;s motivation is, it is wrong, but it is not evil. Malone is also on top of her game as yet another confused young character. Basically, the killing of the child in this film is not the main theme of the movie. The main theme is life itself and how people go about dealing with it, the highs and lows, and how they attempt to sometimes help others deal with their lives (which does not seem to work out very well). There is a lot of good and bad in this world and how we handle each has direct impact on how much more good and bad will take place, and sometimes a confused attempt at doing good, can lead to a whole bunch more of bad. I think this is one of the more memorable films in sometime and has an ending that is as touching as anything in recent movie history. I strongly believe people should view this film, with an open mind.

If you want to enjoy the money you would spend to rent this money, go buy a bag of ice and watch it melt. That&#39;s more entertaining than this movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Cowell, shame on you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or if you wanna see this movie plot, go in a corn field, bring two of the most annoying little girls you can find, run around for a couple hours having the girls scream as loud as possible. Then send me the couple bucks you woulda spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the first Dark Harvest, after watching the sequel, I&#39;m going to cry myself to sleep.

For anyone who has seen and fallen in love with the stage musical A CHORUS LINE, the movie is a shoddy substitute. Not only are songs cut, but unnecessary plot twists added, new dance sequences choreographed, and, let&#39;s face it, Richard Attenborough just doesn&#39;t know how to film dancers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onstage, Michael Bennett&#39;s A CHORUS LINE was just that: Michael Bennett. His idea, his choreography, his direction, his gift to Broadway and the rest of the world. It was two hours of hard-hitting, in-your-face realism that really made you feel for these &#34;boys&#34; and &#34;girls.&#34; The movie, however, lacks empathy and depth: the actors look like they are auditioning for A CHORUS LINE rather than actually auditioning. Every move, every line of dialogue seems so weighted and planned; Michael Douglas, especially, as Zach is too in control for us to believe that he is this extraordinarily bitchy choreographer. Even when he throws his temper tantrums, you never quite believe him because every gesture, every accented word, every nuance is so obviously rehearsed. And as for him not dancing: Kevin Kline auditioned for the role of Zach on Broadway. Michael Bennett loved his reading, but Kline couldn&#39;t dance and ultimately lost the part. How I wish they had done the same for Douglas! A CHORUS LINE is supposed to be a show about nobodies, and aside from a few recognizable faces (Vicki Frederick, who played Cassie on Broadway, as Sheila and Khandi Alexander, of TV&#39;s NewsRadio, as one of the many auditioning dancers) you&#39;re not supposed to KNOW any of these people. Because you DO know these people. Having a star in any of the roles is a terrible decision: when you focus on Michael Douglas and his ranting instead of on the girls and boys on the line and their stories, you lose something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is truly unfortunate that the best sequence in the show (Montage: Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love) is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song entitled &#34;Surprise, Surprise&#34; that surprisingly received a nomination at the Oscars. Cassie&#39;s &#34;mirror dance&#34; has a new song and tragically boring choreography -- one wonders why they bothered to shoot a movie version at all if they were going to mess with a working formula this much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fans of musical theatre and those who enjoyed the stage version, this movie is a sad mockery of everything they cherished and loved. For those who never got to see the original production, either on Broadway or on tour, this movie is the only reference they will have to go by. And they&#39;ll have to wonder just how it got to be the longest-running musical in Broadway history -- until a little show called CATS overtook it in the late 1990&#39;s. But THAT is a different story, and don&#39;t even get me started there.

I love camp movies, believe me and the usual technicolorian gore of Gordon Lewis don&#39;t bother me at all, but this is just one of his most stupid movies, even more than BLOOD FEAST, i&#39;m not kidding. THE GORE GORE GIRLS is about a mad person who kills a lot of go(re) - go(re) girls of a night club. A detective and a reporter tries to find out the big secret. Maybe the performances here are slightly better than the usual average acting H.G Lewis films, but that is not saying much. The camera work is even dreadful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at least is kind of watchable with the go go girls acting ... you going to pass a good time with it, and the killings are just absurd in a very, very bad way: A girl is killed with a wooden hammer punching in her butt (!) and just don&#39;t let me talk about what it does with the nipples. You going to laugh like anyone with this. But the better of all this mess is a scene that i only love of it&#39;s campness: the go-go girl before being attacked by a lot of feminists dancing in a very American way. Though is important to note that this was one of the first films that got an X rating because of it&#39;s violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY if you want lo laugh and pass a good time (But only with a lot, A LOT of beers).

...this verson doesn&#39;t mangle the Bard that badly. It&#39;s still a horrible minimalist production, Hamlet&#39;s Dutch uncle is inexplicably dubbed by a Spaniard (whether it&#39;s Ricardo Montalban or not is subject to debate), and Maximilian Schell overacts like never before. Most of the dialogue makes it through unscathed, and the fact that the MST3K version feels obliged to point out repeatedly that the speeches are long *duh* doesn&#39;t strike me as incredibly humorous. Mostly it&#39;s just bad acting, though.

Canadian director Vincenzo Natali took the art-house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent Cube, which is my personal favourite SF film of the 90s. It framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube, shot entirely on one set, and took this idea in fascinating directions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve been eagerly awaiting Natali&#39;s follow-up, and although its taken five years for him to mount another project, I&#39;m delighted to say it was worth the wait. Cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man&#39;s place in the world, and how through a completely logical chain of events, finds himself in a situation beyond his control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t want to reveal too much about the plot, because one of the joys of Cypher is the different avenues it takes us down. It is so refreshing in this day and age to see a SF film that has more than one idea in it&#39;s head. Cypher is such a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet, is hired by the company DigiCorp. They send him to different parts of America to record different seminars. To his bewilderment, they are unbelievably boring. Covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Morgan is waiting for one seminar, he runs into Rita Foster (an impeccably cast Lucy Liu), the definition of an ice maiden. She gives him the brush-off, but there is something to her he finds irresistible. That&#39;s not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rita turns up at another one of Morgan&#39;s seminars, she tells him his life is not what it appears. And I&#39;m not saying anything more about the plot. To do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us, as well as the tortuous path that&#39;s so much fun to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with Cube, Natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people, taking them out of the familiar, and basically seeing what will happen when they&#39;re thrust into the unknown. And Cypher follows similar patterns. But it&#39;s not a carbon copy of Cube. It has it&#39;s own inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories. One of the great things about Cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge. When Morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle, it&#39;s as much of a shock to us as it is to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that distinguishes Cypher from Cube is how much more polished it is. Where Cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns, Cypher is also on a low budget, but Natali economises it as much as he can, allowing him to broaden the horizon, and launching Morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natali&#39;s direction is exceptional, with a deft hand on the reins. There are some amazing camera angles from above, such as the enormity of the DigiCorp building as a vast, robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is Morgan standing outside. All the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture, which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film-noir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is uniformly excellent throughout. Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity. His performance is excellent because it&#39;s so modulated. He literally seems to transform right before our very eyes. From a clinical, spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in Cube. He resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from Men in Black. His scene is one of the best because it&#39;s an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia. He is a supposed expert in identifying double-agents, and it&#39;s a fantastic piece of writing, brilliantly acted by Hewlett. All he has to do is look at Morgan, and we&#39;re drawn into his complex mind game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#39;s Lucy Liu who&#39;s the scene stealer here. Too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect. But in Cypher, she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove. Rita is an aloof, guarded femme fatale that Liu inhabits with relish. I perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control, and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things come to a very gratifying end, that doesn&#39;t conclude on an ambiguous note the way Cube did. But Morgan deserves his happy ending. After he&#39;s been put through the ringer like this, I cheered for him in the final scene. It&#39;s a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cypher succeeds on all counts. Engaging, shocking, always entertaining, it&#39;s everything that Total Recall wanted to be but wasn&#39;t. And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable Matrix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fine follow-up from Natali. And now I&#39;m a committed fan of the man. Superb stuff!

This movie has one or two slightly interesting gags but they are NOT worth the wait. After an unexplained argument between two guys picking up litter in a drive-in movie theatre we cut to a family leaving! Hollywood and driving driving driving driving their camper van across the screen again and again as inane dialogue is voiced over. At least I think it&#39;s inane, the terrible song that accompanies this montage is mixed so loud it renders the dialogue at times almost inaudible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally the camper van arrives, at night, at a gas station where the family get out, have another inane conversation, before driving off. The camera then pans across to reveal the actor we have just seen drive away. He talks straight to camera and we realise he is the director of the movie we are watching which is about him, and how he came to make the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice idea which ALMOST (but not quite) makes the previous sequences worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the movie unfolds he encounters the two characters we met picking litter at the start of the movie and they all form a motion picture company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All sorts of not very funny and clumsy comedy ensues as they put together a crew and attempt to raise the cash needed to start filming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was obviously put together on a shoe string and a promise and there is a nice little idea in here struggling to get out but the execution is so inept that the idea gets lost. Comedy is more than things just falling over and everyone talking (or shouting) at once. So much of the dialogue here is shouted by several actors simultaneously - Robert Altman can do this sort of thing well because he has a script, rehearsals, decent sound techies, and editing facilities. Everyone shouting at the one mike which, by the sound of it, was hidden in a dustbin in the next room, does not make for clarity.

Watching &#34;Speak Easily&#34; is painful for fans of Buster Keaton. Seeing such a phenomenal writer, actor, comic, director, and stunt man subjected to this humiliating spectacle is like seeing a Picasso used as a drop cloth, or perhaps more like seeing the finest Camembert adulterated with whey solids and processed into Cheez-Whiz. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keaton is ill-cast as Professor Post, whose overblown vocabulary is the only thing keeping him from saying, &#34;Tell me about the rabbits, George.&#34; (Post would have said something like, &#34;Kindly inform me as to the status of the small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, kind sir, who I believe is primarily addressed with the epithet &#39;George&#39;.&#34;) When Keaton created his own characters, they might be situationally clueless but they weren&#39;t stupid. They were quick studies and became masters of their worlds. Not so with Post, who never stops stumbling and bumbling and who who has no more control of his destiny than a bilge rat had of the Titanic. And while Keaton&#39;s original characters had a charming naiveté and innocence, Post comes across as such a profound sexual retardate that if he ever did become physically aroused, he&#39;d put an ice bag on the swelling and seek medical help. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of small, redeeming moments, such as Keaton&#39;s attempts to get rid of the vampish Thema Todd or his suggestion as to appropriate attire for a Greek dance, but it&#39;s just not worth enduring the entire film to see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re a fan of bad movies, get drunk and watch &#34;Speak Easily&#34; with friends, a la &#34;Mystery Science Theater 3000&#34;. But other than that, stick with the silents. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton is remembered for.

Jack Webb is riveting as a Marine Corp drill instructor in the D.I.. Webb play Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough but fair Marine whose job it is to prepare young teens for possible combat. No one could have played this role any better that Jack Webb. As a former Marine,I can assure that this is the most accurate film dealing with basic training in the Corp. Extremely entertaining!

Not much to say other than plenty of Wire-fu and supposed Sholin monks ego-tripping about Kung-fu and caricature Japanese plotting to take over China. All of this would not be so bad if not for the utterly fake Japanese sword fighting. If you watched a Samurai movie or two you can tell that the &#34;Japanese&#34; fighting in the movie is simply the same &#34;Kung-fu&#34; (Really circus acrobats) stunt men doing the same things except with a Japanese sword. However, there are a couple of fun moments such as when a Japanese woman Ninja tears off her clothes in mid-flight to disarm a monk and captures him with a fishing net. Storywise, there seems to be a bit of schizophrenia as far as whether the Japanese should be shown as completely despicable or if there could be exceptions. The &#34;Japanese&#34; protagonist is shown as largely honourable but not beyond unwarranted cruelty such as when he murders a sedated monk so that he may have his duel. Quite disappointing with a very silly ending. Does not for a moment evoke even the semblance of the idea of an epic battle.

This anime recounts the tale of the Battle for Mamodo King. Every 1,000 years, 100 Mamado children are sent to Earth to fight to determine who will be their next king (in the original Japanese, the creatures are Mamono, which literally means magic/evil object). Each Mamado is paired with a Human partner, and given a magic spellbook. The Human can use this book to unleash incredible powers in the Mamodo, and when a Mamodo is defeated, their spellbook is engulfed in flames (alternately, a Mamdodo&#39;s book can be captured and burned directly). After that the Mamodo returns to the Mamodo world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The titular character is Zatch (Gash in Japan), a 6-year old mamodo with electric powers. He is paired with Kiyomaru Takamini, and 14-year old genius. Zatch is initially reluctant to fight, but learning that some Mamodo are evil and deciding the battle for king is wrong, he decided to fight to become a &#39;kind king&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zatch Bell has drawn comparison to Pokemon, but a better comparison is to Digimon. Like Digimon, the Mamodo and Human have a one to one, symbiotic relationship. Also unlike Pokemon, both shows have an actual plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zatch Bell features character growth and evolving relationships, and some fairly adult story lines (like love vs racism; slavery; mind control; etc.). It even has some decent plot twists and mysteries.

Seriously crappy movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse/furniture store. The &#34;bad&#34; cop takes a girl, which they had pulled over, into the warehouse&#39;s attic, while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there. The &#34;bad&#34; cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag, and the newbie cop doesn&#39;t think there are any problems, but he still wonders what was in the bag, so he asks, gets a bullshit response, and then he thinks everything is OK (for now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;bad&#34; cop repeats this process, and even once with a tit scene (made it slightly better). But eventually people start to catch on, which took awhile considering how f***ing obvious it was. One girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies, like ya do. Now, the &#34;bad&#34; cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch, and then he gets rid of the duffel-bagged body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since she had the oogey-boogey magic put on her, she comes back with lots of eye-shadow on, which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie... also, the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become &#34;eye-shadow monsters&#34;. Some of the girls meet up with a dude, who is apparently a currency specialist, and he offers them a ride (they look normal to him apparently). But when the girls see other people, such as the one girls husband, he freaks out because she is hideous (some people freak out, but others don&#39;t even notice).... massive plot hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to wrap it up, the eye-shadow monsters kill the &#34;bad&#34; cop, who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene. It was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel! Like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping.

So I don&#39;t ruin it for you, I&#39;ll be very brief. There&#39;s some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast. A young graduate of Harvard Med School (Brian White) finds out he doesn&#39;t know as much as he thinks about people. He goes to a small hospital in Florida for his internship because a girlfriend (Mya) left him for a job as a TV Producer. His Senior Resident (Wood Harris), helped marvelously by his &#39;creative collaborator&#39;(Zoe Saldana) bring him up to speed. They help protect his career and show him the wider possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money (as seems to be true for many of my pre-med friends).

This must be one of the most annoying, arrogant, poser films I&#39;ve ever seen. What a waste of budget and actors. Angelopoulos has reached new levels of pretentiousness. It is clear there is virtually no plot, even if this part of Greek history is material for great movies. He simply had some supposedly symbolic (actually shambolic) scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them. Death is the main theme and is repeated ad nauseam, along with litanies, processions and the like, which should only be a vehicle for the movie but unfortunately it is the movie itself. A totally incoherent result, which can only leave you saying &#34;huh?&#34; or &#34;oh dear&#34; every two minutes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no character development at all, nada, zilch. I&#39;m usually complaining about some movies having two-dimensional characters, but oh boy, he managed to create one-dimensional characters. This is irritating for us and degrading for some of the actors. He even managed to make one of my favourite Greek actors, Giorgos Armenis, seem wooden. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And going to the core of Angelopoulos film-making: No we&#39;re not idiots. We do not want chewed food. Please someone tell this guy symbolism has to be subtle. Theo do you really underestimate your audience so much or you&#39;re simply incompetent? Personally, I think he tried to make a Greek &#34;Underground&#34;. No matter how he tries, he can&#39;t reach Kusturica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only saving grace: Photography, costumes and the music.

Every country which has a working film industry has some sane (and maybe some insane) artist which make movies that you can only completely understand when you&#39;re a part of this country. I guess Hundstage is such a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see the lowest level of Austria&#39;s society, dirty, disturbed, weird, hateful. But they still have enough money so they can afford tuned cars and big houses. And they are definitely doing a lot of strange things here which maybe seems for them &#39;normal&#39; because they&#39;re doing it through their whole life. From a normal human viewpoint you can now easily follow the movie and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of Austria&#39;s art movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you LIVE here and you know the people you see the characters in Hundstage as the tumor of the society. A society that is going more insane from day to day, creating their own rules that nobody else can understand, cave the social system from within. And you SEE the people. Sitting in the park, standing at the opposite street corner, queuing in the same line. Maybe you meet &#39;em in a bar or a disco you may visit. Maybe you even work with them in your job or they are living next to your house. You start to hate them without exactly knowing why. You&#39;ll try to get away - but you cannot. Maybe you&#39;ll end up like them. But it seems &#39;normal&#39; for you because you&#39;re doing it through your whole life now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life isn&#39;t so bright though Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. It has beautiful people... but some are also ugly. There are a lot of hard working persons trying their best... but there are also some riding on the back of others and destroying everything that the folk of Austria has built up so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very pessimistic movie.

It was a sweet, intro for the most intelegent Sailor Soldier, Sailor Mercury. It consisted with a new &#34;in croud&#34;, Merciurios. He, at the beganing wrote a love letter to Ami, which would be starltling (of course) and, now, Ami thiks he is a chibi-Einstien, and he is attractive (He ended up looking like Umino (Melvin)). This was a halarios (expesialy Minako&#39;s &#34;It&#39;s no skin off my neck&#34; scene (HOT!)) Well, I really like the Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon Series, I personally think its the best anime ever!, But, this movie was nice, funny, but not as adventurios as Sailor Moon R- It was more like the &#34;S&#34; movie. I saw this @ Sailor Moon Univewrse, with real Player, and it was pretty good. (Over all)

I love cinema so what I&#39;m about to confess embarrasses me deeply. I had given a thumbs down to &#34;Che, Parts 1 and 2&#34; without having seen the film. Terrible I know. But I felt into a trap perpetrated by...who? I don&#39;t really know but there has been a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire and, no matter how smart I think I am, I fell into it. But, thankfully, I bumped into an Argeninean film director, Martin Donovan, a man I love and admire. When I told him I wasn&#39;t going to see it because I knew the film was a failure he looked at me as if he was ready to punch me right on the face and Donovan is a pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why. I went to see both parts straight away and, &#34;Che, part 1 and 2&#34; is the best film I&#39;ve seen in 2008. It is, of such purity that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past. The regard for its audience is something that we&#39;re not used to anymore. I don&#39;t know if we ever were. Riveting, moving, without concessions and Benicio del Toro is just extraordinary. We can see his soul, we can actually perceive it. The humanity of the man is overwhelming. So, thank you Martin Donovan once again for educating me so honestly. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone involved in this landmark film. Don&#39;t commit the mistake I was about to commit. Go see it, now, on the big screen

Why this is called &#34;Mistresses&#34; is a puzzle, because it&#39;s about four women, three of whom aren&#39;t mistresses Except, wait. Ah, I see. It&#39;s a salacious title and we all have to merchandise I suppose. The series itself? Delicious. Most of the characters are hell bent on cutting metaphorical chunks off themselves. Great fun. Reminds me of LWT&#39;s 1976 miniseries &#34;Bouquet of Barbed Wire&#34;, where every character and their dads wielded the machete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Siobhan (Orla Brady) is the only actual mistress and she&#39;s getting herself in proper trouble. Husband is infertile. So no chance of a baby there then. But at work, there&#39;s Dominic, played by uber-sexy Adam Rayner, who looks so good that there&#39;s no surprise when heavy lust breaks out. Dominic, it turns out, has no fertility problems. I expect his sperms do swashbuckling - probably each carries a little sword - and now Siobhan is inevitably pregnant that way instead. What Siobhan should do is to shut up good and tight, and go with - it&#39;s a miracle. What she actually does of course is say to her friends &#34;I have to tell my husband&#34;. No you don&#39;t. Really, you don&#39;t. Stop. Stop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie (Sarah Parish) was a mistress once, for we learn that she&#39;d had an affair with a married man before the series started. Unwisely, she&#39;s now taken up with his son. The father died of cancer and Katie, who is a doctor, helped him on his journey. So, she&#39;s an euthanasiarist, has had affairs with two of her patients and is sleeping with the son of the father in carelessly ignoring the incestuous undertones. It&#39;s not going to end well for Katie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica is an experimental lesbian. She arranges events and she&#39;s busy doing a lesbian marriage as the series gets underway. She quickly gets into steamy eye exchanges with one of the brides Alex, played by Anna Torv, and the script hurries along to a lesbonk with great haste. However, it can&#39;t think of a good way of putting the two women in bed together, so it invents a very lame &#34;You&#39;re not having a hen night?! Well I can&#39;t let you get away with that. I&#39;ll organise one and the guests shall be .. Me!&#34;, which achieves the result but isn&#39;t exactly Winterson. I thought script writers were supposed to earn their living. Lazy. Torv&#39;s interpretation of her character is good. Alex treats Jessica as possibly unsavoury and Alex&#39;s body language always points backwards when she&#39;s moving forward. Mind, once she&#39;s over the wall, in she happily goes, and unsurprisingly, for Shelley Conn is so mouth-watering that so would a good percentage of the human race given the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings us to Trudi, who&#39;s a widow. Of course there should be plain people in a community but, if you&#39;re going to have a plain character, then you have to invent something to admire in them. It&#39;s quite possible to be a lump and engaging. However, Small&#39;s Trudi looks like one of those characters that Casting put prominently in a medieval crowd scene after the director said &#34;That&#39;s ridiculous, not every single character would be pretty&#34;. More tellingly, you can&#39;t find anything to admire in her. Nothing. She&#39;s a turnip in a bowl of apples. Appallingly, she does &#34;sexy&#34; from time to time. I won&#39;t forget her appearance in bright red corset with stockings tucked into her crotch for a long time, and for all the wrong reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, good, delinquent fun all round. There&#39;s easily enough material here for a second series and I hope that they do one. I trust they learn one lesson though. The characters never take off their underclothes in bed! Having spent abandoned hours of unbridled lust, afterwards they surface still wearing their bras, or keep the sheets tight wound round their naughty bits. After several episodes, no nipples yet and you can go beg for a cock. What&#39;s this? Early 21st century puritanism? So production team, are you listening? Your characters will solve some of their mental problems if they Do abandon as well as Talk it. At least they&#39;ll have more fun in the fun scenes, poor things. In a series dominated by either being in the bedroom, or wanted to be in the bedroom, or having just been in the bedroom, it&#39;s a bit silly, and jars a lot, that the characters bonk in their underwear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall. I was going to score 6 (top end medium), but the series does one trick that&#39;s rare enough. When each episode ends, you always want more, and you look forward to the next one with anticipation. So I score 7.

This film was excellent - the emotional power of Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta&#39;s performances brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart - this film shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this film had come out at the end of 1988, instead of Rain Man, Hulce would certainly have been at least nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. Definitely a must-see!

The Brighton has a traumatic drama in the breast of their family: the twenty years old Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts) is retarded due to a fall when she was one, and her overprotective mother Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan) blames her negligence for the accident. The seventeen years old Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose) loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily. Their father Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his models of trains and railroads. Evie mysteriously sabotages her interviews for different universities being rejected, and teaches the poetries of her own to Emily. When Martha hears Emily repeating the poems, she takes notes and shows them to the English teacher Stewart Worthy (Christopher Lloyd), who believes that Emily has had a moment of geniuses. When Evie&#39;s only friend James (Fran Kranz) reads the notes, he immediately discloses the truth about the authority of the poetries. But when Martha becomes aware, she finds the reality of Evie, triggering a series of revelations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Admissions&#34; is a very powerful drama about needy of love and guilty complex. The performances are stunning, and this is the first work of Lauren Ambrose, from &#34;Six Feet Under&#34;, that I see and she is amazing. This independent movie is an excellent choice for the viewers that are looking for a refreshing story based on the acting of the cast. My vote is eight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;Cumplicidade&#34; (&#34;Complicity&#34;)

***SPOILERS*** This film depicts the brutal bloodbath caused by the retirement of Johnny Carson to determine who would succeed him. The impersonations of David Letterman and Jay Leno are performed in a satisfactory way by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, though the performances weren&#39;t great. Reni Santoni is the best-performing of the &#34;execs&#34; (he plays John Agoglia of NBC), and Warren Littlefield (played by Bob Baliban) is a close second. I was shocked at the way in which Littlefield eagerly discussed dumping Johnny Carson. This was Johnny Carson! This scene evinces the cut-throat, what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world of television. Kathy Bates delivered the best performance of the film as Jay&#39;s agent, Helen Kushnick. Another commenter asserted that Leno was portrayed as a simpleton in the film. I respectfully disagree. The relationship with Kushnick bordered on something akin to domestic violence. She orders him around, and, when he rebels against her at the end, she tries to play the sympathy card (mentioning her dead husband and son); however, when Jay terminates their relationship, she turns violent again, screaming &#34;Don&#39;t you leave me, you two-faced bastard!&#34; before smashing a picture on the floor. Overall, the movie is hilarious, and I wish that it were shown more often.

This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties. It&#39;s the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway, and the training of the dancers. Finally, the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing. Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabin is in great form as the easy-going Danglard--see him deal humorously with Nini&#39;s violent boyfriend. Gianni Esposito is moving as the wistful Prince who is courting Nini. Maria Felix, with that amazon&#39;s body, is imposing as the egotistical Lola, Danglard&#39;s first lover. Finally Françoise Arnoul as Nini the washing girl who ends up dancing for Danglard, and becoming his girl, is just stunning; her loveliness and pert charm will win you over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bonus: we get Edith Piaf, Patachou, André Claveau and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the Moulin rouge.

Although Bullet In The Brain is, without question, superior amongst short films, it largely seems more like a short piece of writing than a film. And it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot. But after the bullet enters his brain we begin to understand a little bit about why he became so jaded with life in the first place. There is an awful amount of detail packed into this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a little bit - it seems like there&#39;s almost too much to take in at once as the details come flying at you so fast. A slightly more relaxed pace and a less po-faced narrator in the final section would have benefitted this film a little bit. Despite these complaints, there is no denying that Bullet In The Brain is a quite stupendous work compared to many short, and even full length films. The makers should be applauded for trying to make such a basically emotional and literate film in the current climate of quick jokes and Hollywood action.

Many have stated that Orca  Killer Whale is a Jaws rip-off. This is not really true, though the enormous commercial success of Jaws undoubtedly made these man .vs. beast stories more attractive propositions for film-makers in the second half of the &#39;70s. Orca  Killer Whale would be better described as a modern-day retread of Moby Dick. It&#39;s a story about obsession. On one hand a whale&#39;s obsessive quest to avenge the death of its mate; on the other a bounty hunter&#39;s obsessive quest to kill the whale before it can claim any more lives. Sadly, Orca- Killer Whale emerges a very disappointing film, its fundamentally interesting ideas somewhat ruined by hammy performances and preposterous plotting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shark hunter Nolan (Richard Harris) encounters a marine-life researcher Rachel Bedford (Charlotte Rampling) diving off the Atlantic coast of Canada. Their meeting almost ends in disaster when Rachel&#39;s team are attacked by a Great White Shark, but a Killer Whale arrives in the nick of time to stop the shark. After this, Nolan becomes increasingly obsessed with capturing a Killer Whale and selling it to an aquarium. But his plans backfire when he accidentally kills a pregnant female of the species while the distraught male looks on. Rachel tells Nolan that a Killer Whale is an incredibly intelligent mammal with a strong memory and feelings just like a human. Worse still, native Umilak (Will Sampson) warns him that the whale will always remember its grief and do everything it can to have revenge. Nolan initially tries to forget about the whole regrettable incident, but the whale causes havoc in the fishing town and the disgruntled locals begin to demand that Nolan puts to sea to track it down and destroy it. Eventually Nolan is forced to pursue the Killer Whale the hunt leads all the way to the desolate ice floes of the Arctic Ocean, where man and beast play out their final fatal battle against each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things stand out in this film. One is the haunting score by Ennio Morricone (perhaps the greatest composer of film music of all-time, his talents wasted on various tenth-rate clunkers during the 70s and 80s). The other is the amazing widescreen photography of Ted Moore, which makes the film consistently pleasing to the eye. In every other department, Orca  Killer Whale is a shoddy film that does nothing to enhance the reputation of its talented cast and crew. Harris appears extremely ill throughout the film, his hair bedraggled, black rings around his eyes and skin deathly pale. His performance lacks the usual vitality. Rampling strikes a lot of sexy poses but fails to convince with her long-winded and ill-informed explanations about the ways of whales. The rest of the actors are wasted in brief and undeveloped roles, the most memorable of which sees Bo Derek getting her leg bitten off by the vengeful whale. The plot is total nonsense from start to finish, with such preposterous sequences as the whale deliberately starting a fire in the fishing village that engulfs and destroys the local refinery! Although it&#39;s credible to suppose that whales are intelligent creatures with genuine emotions, the idea that a whale could plot revenge against a single human adversary and carry it out so calculatedly is utterly absurd. Orca  Killer Whale is really one for completists of the man .vs. beast cycle from the late 70s. Most will come away from the film shaking their heads in disbelief and grinding their teeth with despair.

I found this to be an utter waste of time, effort and money. I know Disney always displays lack of creativity when making &#34;straight-to-video&#34; films - but rehashing the plot of the original film with a &#34;new perspective&#34; is an all-time low...soon they&#39;ll just be re-releasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a &#34;new version of the movie we all love.&#34; Nathan Lane surprisingly returns to his role of Timon yet again. Timon and Pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original &#34;Lion King&#34; embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it REALLY happened...as they see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course Timon is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap. The vocal talents are impressive for a video feature, but then again, when was the last time you remember Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane being in anything of real commercial substance? Overall if you liked the original you&#39;ll hate this. It&#39;s insulting because it&#39;s unfair to children and adults alike. And that about sums it up.

&#34;Tapeheads&#34;, a scrappy, intermittently funny spoof of the music video business, might have been the perfect comedic short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly in the swing of the nonsensical chaos involved. They play two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company, Video Aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties, and one deathbed star. It&#39;s too bad the filmmakers had to invent a dim side-plot to pad the running time (shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which doesn&#39;t do much except take away from the movie&#39;s primary strength, sending-up the music culture of the late-&#39;80s). Still, Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals here: nerdy but loose, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same nutty wavelength, and they never put each other down. They&#39;re the real thing in buddy-comedies. *1/2 from ****

This movie was not very well directed. they almost totally disregarded the book.I guess they were trying 2 save time. the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played finny was cute. Some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book. Major parts of the book were once again chopped out.You lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely. Also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary. Also i was surprised ( not pleasantly) by a new character that was no where in the book.One of my favorite characters (leper) was poorly interpreted and portrayed. He seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book. Over all disappointing.

I don&#39;t know what some of you are smoking, but i suspect it&#39;s potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To call Swept Away awful would be an insult to the very concept of terribleness. The acting is hideous and i&#39;m not picking on Madonna here, we all know she&#39;s useless, but someone should have warned everyone else that her ailment is contagious. My back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered lines. The editing is so sloppy, it beggars description. The photography and composition (which in this era, competence should be a GIVEN for any film with a budget) are astonishingly inept, even the lighting is horrid and unnatural looking. These are BASIC elements of filmmaking, if you can&#39;t get them right, you should seek another line of work. It&#39;s as contrived as a grade 3 production of Snow White, except nowhere near as well made or interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original film by Lina Wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor, superbly acted and written, featuring breathtaking visuals - you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the windswept sand in your hair. The sexual tension feels real and immediate...those of you who found Guy Ritchie&#39;s version deplorable, should see it, it really is one of the landmarks of world cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you who thought the remake is some kind of masterpiece should have your heads examined.

Corky Romano has to be one of the most jaw dropping and horrific &#34;comedy&#39;s&#34; ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the sometimes amusing Chris Kattan who pulled off a very funny performance in the hilarious &#39;Undercover Brother&#39; his character in Corky is so stupid and so unfunny-which is a shame since the premise is a wonderful idea. To bad they ran out of them when they got to page 3 on the script.

This is one of the most laughably bad films I&#39;ve ever seen. I cannot believe whoever wrote the review above was serious. Perhaps he was connected with making it. It doesn&#39;t have anything going for it. There is no suspense, the acting is dire, the direction hopeless. The music score (?) is three trite notes played ad nauseam. The plot (?) must have taken all of five minutes to write. The dialogue is what a 10-year-old would come up with if asked to do a homework project. The only (slightly) redeeming feature is the actor playing the psycho himself, who grimaces, trembles and gurns magnificently and thus is amusing at times. The only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you were suffering from a weak bladder. Don&#39;t waste your time.

The idea of nine stupid prisoners escaping and going on a road trip sounds pretty good for a movie. Especially because it&#39;s meant to be funny and I guess heart-warming in some weird way. The problem is, the movie was very rarely funny and often just seemed pointless and needlessly gross. It was as if jokes or interesting scenes were being set up again and again but no one bothered finishing any of them--there was just no payoff. Also, the movie was just brainless and had the crooks meandering across Japan even though they left so many crime victims alive that it&#39;s impossible to believe they wouldn&#39;t have been caught almost immediately--especially since they continued to keep using the same stolen camper for days on end. And as far as being gross goes, I just didn&#39;t need to see scene after scene after scene of guys peeing along the side of the road. Plus, believe it or not, there is a scene where four of the guys are out raping sheep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really hated this movie. And it&#39;s a shame, as I almost always love Japanese films--just not poorly made and uninteresting ones like this one.

I have decided to flush this show from my memory down the toilet of bad TV show into the obscurity of forgetful, disappointing, pointless, garbage TV show hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Skyler guy who is the host/star/creator of this show is boring, uninteresting, unbelievable, not particularly good looking and not at all funny, in short why is this guy on TV and especially why is he in a comedy show when he&#39;s not funny, pretending to be a professional con man when he definitely is nothing but an obvious pretender? Others have said it here already but this guy is a total fake and fraud, if you believe any of these cons I think you should seriously consider going to get your head checked because they&#39;re all fake, and the ones that might possibly be true are so pointless, like spending all day to con someone out of giving you an average meal at a restaurant? Seriously this guy needs to go away, glad this show got canned.

A movie best summed up by the scene where a victim simulates disembowelment by pulling some poor animal&#39;s intestines out from under her T-shirt. Too terrible for words.

the 25th hour was a movie i just chanced upon.tuning in late at night, this movie kept my fascination throughout the entire film.tony quin is this poor unsuspecting guy who just wanted to fall in love with a woman,and by simple jealousy , goes on this incredible journey--terrific movie,and a hidden treasure.

This jingoist outing concerns the usual battle Holmes vs. Moriaty,but this time in an effort to save the British war against the Nazis.Sherlock Holmes(Rathbone) and Watson(Bruce),the detecting duo living in 223 Baker Street,again are up against their old enemy Dr. Moriarty(Lionel Atwill).The film starts in Switzerland where Holmes saves from the Nazis to an inventor of a bomb-sight,named Dr. Tobel(Post).Back in London,Tobel hand over four parts of the device to diverse scientist.But Doctor Tobel is kidnapped by Moriarty.Sherlock must to solve his disappearance and some vitally important.Holmes only holds a clue left his girlfriend(Kareen Verne),the detective with an extraordinary mechanism get decode it.But dead body scientific are accumulating but have appeared murdered and Moriarty knows the keys ,as well.Holmes disguised as sailor goes out to investigate ,finding the Moriarty&#39;s shelter .The picture is based on¨ the dancing men¨by Arthur Conan Doyle.This is a Rathbone-Bruce effort for the WWII along with ¨The voice of terror¨ in which we are asked to believe the magnificent detective could have lived in this century. Both stories are completely patriotic and flag-waging movies.In fact,on the end there&#39;s an advertising buying of war bonds with evident propaganda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is an excellent Holmes thriller with gripping wartime setting and unanswered mysteries and unstopped suspense.In the film appear the habituals from Holmes series.His nemesis Moriarty,,Mistress Hudson,Inspector Lestrade( a funny Dennis Hoey) and of course the bumbling Dr. Watson.Basil Rathbone performance is splendid ,he&#39;s the best cinema&#39;s Holmes similar to television&#39;s Peter Cushing and Jeremy Brett.Rathbone as whimsical sleuth is top notch,he&#39;s in cracking form,intelligent,broody and impetuous.He&#39;s finely matched in battle of wits with Moriarty,his arch-enemy,a first range villain: Lionel Atwill.Nigel Bruce plays Watson with humor,jinx,goofy and mirth.He&#39;s the perfect counterpoint of Holmes.Besides appear briefly distinguished secondaries as Paul Fix and Whit Bissell.This classic gets an atmospheric black and white cinematography but available colorized in a horrible version.Adequate music score fitting to suspense by Frank Skinner.The motion picture is professionally R. William O&#39;Neal,the usual saga director and habitual in the monsters movies Universal.

What can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude? &#34;The Sopranos&#34; has literally redefined television as we know it. It has broken all rules, and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless, the writing, directing, and for me, most of all, the acting. Watching this show you&#39;ll find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real. The acting tricks you into thinking there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people don&#39;t watch the show because it&#39;s violent, it&#39;s not all about the violence, it&#39;s about business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what you, as a fan see. For me, I don&#39;t like when people refer to the show, a show about the Mafia. For me, it&#39;s a show about family. A family who, through generations, happen to be apart of the mob. Overall this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Right here. Complex characters from stunning acting, magnificent story lines from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence, and dares to be different.

This is an excellent movie and should be presented every year during the holidays @ Christmas! Beautiful with great acting. John Denver at his best, i,e, sincere, kind, talented, and natural. The town is Georgetown, Colorado and every bit as lovely as in the story.

&#34;In the Mood for Love&#34; a teasing allegory of loneliness and longing. Here is a film without sex, or even kissing -- and it is no doubt one of the sexiest and definetly the most thought-provoking and psychological romance I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Telling the story of two people who coincidentally, live in the same apartment, and are a door away from each other. The film, like and unlike &#34;Random Hearts,&#34; is about how two people come together via the affair of their two lovers. Only once they receive this news, they take the time to think about the consequences of an affair, and each other&#39;s feelings towards having just broken-up -- and whether or not the two people are willing enough to fall back in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s terrific about the film is the way director Wong Kar-Wai, presents each character&#39;s way of dealing with loneliness. With Maggie Cheung&#39;s character, he&#39;ll show her, in a repeated montage: leaving work, going home, watching her neighbors gamble, head to the noodle shop, leave the noodle shop, and bump into her attractive age-equal, played by Tony Leung. This is a clever, if not subtle and knowing technique to present loneliness. For it is when you are alone, when you find yourself falling into a loop. This movie worked for me because I can identify with that feeling.

Think Jumanji but with a death curse. A bunch of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that takes the life of some one who is playing it. Supposedly it was made from the skin of a witch during the Spanish Inquisition and carries a nasty curse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, undemanding and just sort of watchable tale isn&#39;t anything you haven&#39;t seen before.Frankly its a been there and done that story that hits all the right buttons in such away as to have no real surprises. Far from the worst thing that SyFy has run but certainly its not the best. There are better choices out there but if this is your only choice you won&#39;t completely hate it.

The comments of the previous user are harsh indeed. One wonders if they have even seen this beautiful sweet film. As for being so nasty about it in front of the writer/director..well thats just plain rude! For those who grew up in the eighties, it is an artful piece of nostalgia and a sweet story well acted and produced. Irish film-making sure has a lot of bitter angry people involved with it and the spleen venting comment made about this is evidence of it.. As people we have a choice; give out and moan about the people who actually go out there and make stuff or make something yourself.. I know which one is easier... Do yourself a favour and watch this film and see how a short film is made... you won&#39;t be disappointed

I saw the movie recently during the Boston Film festival. The movie was very entertaining and is something that I believe the world, and black America is ready to see. It has comedy,drama, the soundtrack is great. It is an all around good film. The characters were well developed, and the movie had a wide variety of prominent actors, such as Wood Harris(Remember the Titains, Paid in Full), Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr 3000), and the wonderful Zoe Saldana(Drumline, Pirates of the Caribbean). The movie tackles many relevant topics in todays society in a short period of time, and does so with class and grace. This is not only a story about life in the hospital, however it is a story about people and their personal journey to discovering who they are, or who they are going to be.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Not worth the film&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an avid Gone With the Wind fan, I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. Luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. When the book Scarlett came out, I read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. While the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as I was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. However, I consider the six hours I spent watching the &#34;Scarlett&#34; miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. Discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell&#39;s book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from. The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. In the novel, Scarlett O&#39;Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. After coming to an &#34;arrangement&#34; with Rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her O&#39;Hara relatives in Savannah. Eventually, she accompanies her cousin Colum, a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood, to Ireland, to further explore her family&#39;s &#34;roots that go deep,&#34; and is eventually named &#34;The O&#39;Hara,&#34; the head of the family. While her duties as The O&#39;Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara, Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. She, having been scorned by Rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry Luke, the earl of Fenton, until Rhett comes along in a clichéd &#34;night-on-white-horse&#34; - type of a rescue. The &#34;Scarlett&#34; miniseries fails even to do this justice. Raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family, the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A middle aged man, Robert Jordan, set in his ways, takes on a boy scout troop after his predecessor leaves under duress. Jordan takes on the pack mostly to learn what the boys like so he can revive his flagging radio program which is losing it&#39;s appeal to the younger set. He has a rough go at first with the boys, especially so with Mike, an 8 year old who forms an attachment for the older man which is anything but reciprocated. Do things work out for Jordan and the scouts? Check out this entertaining and amusing film from the old days.

Abu, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, helps King Ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames, Sir Alexander Korda&#39;s London Films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of The Arabian Nights. Replete with swords &amp; sorcery, it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines. It also is a fine piece of film making, featuring good acting and an intelligent script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conrad Veidt gets top billing and he deserves it, playing the evil magician Jaffar. His saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during Silent days. Here is a villain worth watching. As the boyish Thief, Sabu is perfectly cast in this, his third film. While not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deed &amp; action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the cast do fine work. John Justin is both energetic &amp; sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way; Sabu gets a significant part of the action (when he&#39;s not transformed into a dog) but Justin is appropriately athletic when needs must. Lovely June Duprez plays the endangered Princess of Basra, coveted by two very different men. Appearing late in the film, massive Rex Ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allan Jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the Storyteller. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike Sultan of Basra, forever dithering on about his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the film&#39;s screen play &amp; dialogue). Aged Morton Selten portrays the benevolent King of Legend. Mary Morris, later an exceptional stage actress, plays the dual roles of Jaffar&#39;s accomplice and the six-armed Silver Dancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film was begun in Britain, but wartime difficulties made Korda move it to Southern California, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The art direction, in vibrant Technicolor, is most attractive, especially the fairy tale architecture in blues, whites &amp; pinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysore&#39;s stables when he was discovered by Korda&#39;s company and set before the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed. After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career, but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films, BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) being the one great exception. His final movie, Walt Disney&#39;s A TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years of age.

Having enjoyed Joyce&#39;s complex novel so keenly I was prepared to be disappointed by Joseph Strick&#39;s and Fred Haines&#39;s screenplay, given the fabulous complexity of the original text. However, the film turned out to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone, naturalism, and levity of the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film. I imagine the latter would seem disjointed, with very odd episodes apparently randomly stitched together, without a prior reading of the text to help grasp the plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s amazing to see how &#34;filthy&#34; the film is, given that it was shot in Dublin in 1967. The Irish film censors only, finally, unbanned it for viewing by general audiences in Ireland as late as 2000 (it was shown to restricted audiences in a private cinema club, the Irish Film Theatre, in the late 1970s). Joyce&#39;s eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy, it offers many wildly &#34;perverse&#34; episodes. Never mind that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still utterly taboo when the film was made in 1967.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is astonishing and heartening to watch the cream of the Irish acting profession of the 1960s, respected players all, daring to utter and enact Joyce&#39;s hugely transgressive text with such gusto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!

Robin Williams is a genius. One of the best comedians in the world. He really shows off in this one, cracking jokes left and right as the talk show comedian Tom Dobbs. From the previous this looked like it would be a side-splitting laugh fest. And it was funny. But there were a lot of serious parts in the movie that I was not expecting. I would describe it as a drama/comedy. But it&#39;s still worth the money to see, and I still found it to be almost everything that I expected. Robin Williams is at his best, along with the famous Christopher Walken. They play a very good team in this movie and I was actually shocked to see how well the two were able to work together. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a light-hearted movie.

As someone who has lived with cerebral palsey for over forty years, I find this movie to be inspirational. If someone with such a severe case of CP as Christie Brown has can do so much, then there&#39;s no reason that I couldn&#39;t achieve my own dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker both give awesome performances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This film is brilliant! It touches everyone who sees it in an extraordinary way. It really takes you back to your youth and puts a new perspective on how you view your childhood memories. There are so many layers to this film. It is innovative and absolutely fabulous!

With a Bo Derek movie, the audience get just what they expect. A paper thin plot and a few shots of Mrs. Derek in no clothes. &#39;Ghosts can&#39;t do it&#39; is just that. The first fifteen minutes is ordinary TV drama, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with long experience in a lot of different roles, but it seems as even a famous actor need to work just for money sometimes. Bo Derek is the opposite, always playing a strikingly handsome young woman with or without clothes. The movie is a complete waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see nude women or bad acting, rent any porno movie.

I had been looking forward to How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People for months, particularly due to the fact that Kirsten Dunst and Simon Pegg were starring. Simon Pegg is a comedic genius and Kirsten Dunst has always been a favorite actress of mine. How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People hit the spot! Of course not perfect, but very enjoyable and funny. How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People follows the life of Sidney Young, a smalltime, bumbling, British celebrity journalist, who is hired by an upscale magazine in New York City. In spectacular fashion Sidney enters high society and burns bridges with bosses, peers and superstars. After disrupting one black-tie event by allowing a wild pig to run rampant, Sidney catches the attention of Clayton Harding, editor of Sharp, and accepts a job with the magazine in New York City. Clayton warns Sidney that he&#39;d better impress and charm everyone he can, if he wants to succeed. Instead, Sidney instantly insults and annoys fellow writer Alison Olsen (Kirsten Dunst). He dares to target the star clients of power publicist Eleanor Johnson (Gillian Anderson). He also upsets his direct boss Lawrence Maddox (Danny Huston). Sidney finds creative ways to annoy nearly everyone. His saving grace, a rising starlet Sophie Maes (Megan Fox) who develops an odd affection for him. In time, Allison&#39;s friendship might be the only thing saving Sydney from his downward spiraling career. The storyline is very interesting and the acting was top notch with what the actors were given. Simon Pegg is still hilarious as ever! He makes Sydney bumbling, obnoxious, and annoying as real as it gets, but later in time making Sydney not just likable, but also a real character who you root for in the end. Kirsten Dunst and Jeff Bridges were brilliant! Kirsten had some very wonderful acting and hilarious scenes, and Jeff Bridges is just Jeff f*cking Bridges! How can you not like him?! He makes Clayton a very humorous character with some wit and overall you just love the guy. Gillian Anderson, Megan Fox, and Danny Huston were great as the supporting cast. Each had their own personality that were overall pretty unlikable, but that&#39;s what just made the film work. One thing I didn&#39;t enjoy was how one dimensional some of the characters were. I understand that most were the supporting cast, but some of the cast was underused and could&#39;ve given the film some more spice to it. How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People will never be on anyone&#39;s top 10 films ever, or even top 10 comedies ever, but it has a very high entertainment level and some scenes may even charm you as well. How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People is definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the year! 8/10

My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and &#34;starring&#34; KANE. WWE might have a big following but it&#39;s a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park &#34;sport&#34; and those who don&#39;t love it HAATTTE IT!! It would make them steer clear of an otherwise typical gory slasher flick that people would come out in droves to see. See No Evil doesn&#39;t break ANY new horror ground, it&#39;s exactly play by play typical horror with some over the top, horrific bloody scenes that honestly make your screen crawl. They really drive it home and go for gratuitous violence just cause. There is no psychological aspect exactly although being chased by this monster has some fear elements to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KANE (the wrestler) also known as Glen Jacobs plays religiously and physically tortured man Jacob Goodnight. He&#39;s the ultimate cross between Leatherface, and Jason Voorhees. He&#39;s not an original killer and even his kills don&#39;t really go for the unique or original with the major exception of choking a girl to death by forcing her to swallower her cell phone...yeeeeah!! He does a good job and the man is legitimately enormous!! He stands at 7 feet tall and without any special effects is monstrous!! Tiffany Lamb, Penny McNamee, Samantha Noble, Michael J. Pagan, Luke Pegler, Christina Vidal, Rachael Taylor all play the typical group of &#34;think they are invincible&#34; partying teens who will unwillingly become victim to the serial killer. The story is that in exchange for a month off their detention sentence for petty crimes ranging from theft to drug possession, they are sent to an old hotel to do &#34;community service &#34; by fixing it up. Turns out a serial killer lives upstairs and he&#39;s removing his victims eyes to cleanse them of their sins. Luke Pegler stands out as a scum bag who in the end becomes a hero of sorts even saving his ex-girlfriend who he used to beat up on. The rest of them all play their perspective roles quite well but it isn&#39;t a great stretch of acting ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly Porn director...yes PORN...Gregory Dark, does a good job putting together the modern day slasher flick. He even goes into a bit of history with the killer and although his back story is not unique either, in fact it&#39;s a little stale it&#39;s still interesting enough. And in the few shots where the film goer is actually seeing through the killer&#39;s eyes, it&#39;s interesting to hear the voices and see things distorted like he does. He throws in the obligatory soft core nude shot, and the grotesque, blood soaked scenes and turns everything up a notch. It fits nicely and for a horror fan like myself it&#39;s entertaining. Kane&#39;s serial killer is horrifying and he stalks them all down with brutal intelligence and a silent horror. The film is being panned and crapped on and I don&#39;t blame anyone because it&#39;s pretty crappy but isn&#39;t that the point?? It&#39;s a horror film and I thought it was exactly what it should be. It made me jump, it made me cringe, it even made ME turn away at several parts...impressive by any standards. It&#39;s entertaining, with a decent story, and plenty of set up to serialize See No Evil until the 15th installment if they wanted to and I say bring it on!! It&#39;s true the film is full of plot holes, laughable details but the deadly gore and horror over rides it all. It all comes down to do you love horror films?? Really love them?? If yes then you&#39;ll think this is a terrific slasher...if not...you&#39;ll hate it...plain and simple. 8.5/10

Brown returned to his role from the year before (in &#34;Slaughter&#34;) for this rough follow-up film. In the original, he had avenged his parents&#39; slaying by wiping out a huge mob organization in Mexico. Here, he is the one being pursued (retaliated against) by a money launderer portrayed by McMahon. When the first assassination attempt fails, Brown is back in action once more, kicking gangster butt all over the place while trying to protect his new girlfriend Hendry. While the original film was, overall, a better and more coherent movie, this one delivers all the exploitation aspects in far heavier doses, making it more pleasing to fans of the genre. Aside from a fairly dreary opening on horseback and a downright deadly car ride down a city street at night, this movie clips along at a very brisk pace. Every few minutes there appears one or more of the following: drug use, sex, nudity, gunplay, murder or some other action. Brown is his usual reliable, amiable self, helped by his amazing physical presence which goes a long way in glossing over any stiffness in his acting. McMahon is a riot! With tinted glasses and his hair parted down the middle (!), he is shown meting out orders to his gang of thugs and is overheard making passionate love to his fur-clad bimbo. Seeing Johnny Carson&#39;s sidekick in a role like this is a perverse thrill. Stroud makes an impression as an intense, racially-bigoted hit-man while Peters adds just a tinge of class as an upright police detective who enlists Brown&#39;s aid. Sadly, no mention at all is made of Brown&#39;s original sidekicks Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown now has a girlfriend (Hendry) who is likable enough, but lacking in the voluptuousness and personality that Stevens had before. Williams does an outrageous turn as a pimp who can seemingly pick any girl out of a bar and make her an instant member of his harem. The cinematography and overall direction is less polished than the first film, but this one does have a drive and a sense of danger that exceeds the original&#39;s feel. The film spends a lot of time in the sewage of organized crime, drugs, prostitution and other vices, but it retains interest through the creativity of its action scenes and the now-startling lack of political correctness. One odd note: A key supporting player in the first film was shown getting shot to death, but pops up here in a different role.

Well I just gave away 95 minutes and 47 seconds that I&#39;ll never get back on this piece of trash. I heard someone online describe this movie&#39;s villains as &#34;subhuman cannibals&#34;, and I thought it was promising because I thought it would be like the Descent. WRONG! The Descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline. These villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch. This movie isn&#39;t so controversial, I&#39;ve seen this level of gore in many films. This movie plain sucks. SYNOPSIS: A blonde who thinks she&#39;s real hot (but she isn&#39;t), her admirer, and her admirer&#39;s friend (no, I don&#39;t remember their names) go into the woods. Their car breaks down. They are warned to leave by a man named Mark. The blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they can&#39;t find the admirer&#39;s friend. Admirer impales his foot (whoops!). Don&#39;t worry, he is much more upset when his car won&#39;t start than when he gets impaled by nails. After a nanosecond of coaxing, the blond leaves to find help. Events ensue that I cannot remember. During this and throughout the movie, we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag. Blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals (even though all they are seen eating is intestines, which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual food). Blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard (unsuccessfully) to work up tears. Then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can &#34;out think them&#34;. Mark (the man who warned them to leave) has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his family. Then there is some shooting, they leave the house, the shooting continues, then a random guy shows up and says he&#39;s been watching them. Before he is shot, we are shown an acid-trip inspired scene of more killing. The blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them. There&#39;s more killing, the admirer professes his love for the blonde. Then a mysterious hand covers the camera. What does that imply? I don&#39;t know, hopefully not a sequel.

I thought i could see something good but... I am tired after seeing this movie, i don&#39;t know what i hated the most: the script, the acting, the FX or the music. Try to picture the worst Power Rangers episode and would still be to kind. I&#39;ve seen better FX in FPS Games( The touch with the bone sword or his breath that is making the people disappear in a green smoke is touch of genius) and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western. I did liked how the women in the car was screaming, when the &#34;monster&#34; was walking around the car (even if she&#39;s looking in the wrong way). So give your self a break and don&#39;t watch this thing, at least call somebody up to see a horror movie with you, trust me you will end up playing monopoly for some kicks.

I love Stephen Kings work and the book was great but I was very disappointed when I bought this movie on DVD. This was one of the worst B-movies I have ever seen. It feels like they had a tight schedule and only took one shot at every scene even if it turned out to be a bad one. And where did they find the actors.

How? I wondered why I hadn&#39;t seen this in theaters, or even a single commercial for it, and then after I saw the movie, I realized I was duped HARDCORE. I am a big Transporter fan, and a big Blade fan, so when I saw this I imagined some killer fight scene between two badasses, lots of gunplay, a whole bunch of stuff. Instead, I got the Ryan Phillippe movie with a brief cameo by Statham and Snipes. The guy that does the audio and video in the crime lab got more screen time than Wesley. It was like renting a Jackie Chan movie expecting a bunch of kung fu and getting Erin Brockavich. I expect bad movies from Hollywood, but actors like Snipes and Statham should treat the fan base better.

Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He&#39;s in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it&#39;s what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.

This film has so little class in comparison to Strangers on a Train or even, Accidental Meeting for that matter, that despite plot similarities I wouldn&#39;t feel right in actually comparing this to either of them. The Yancy Butler character came across as such a dopey dimwit I was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t enjoy many Lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home. I often groan silently but this film caused me to protest out loud, stand up leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself, before I returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY

This movie is truly boring. It was banned in Chinese cinema and i can see why. It&#39;s not because it&#39;s critical of the communist regime but simply because the movie is of such low quality. I would never want to pay money to watch this. I love movies from Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and i am disappointed such a poor movie could come out of China. It totally seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the movie for himself. The shots of a person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute are hilarious and there&#39;s plenty of them. The cinematography and video quality are unbelievably bad. I looked this film up on the Net and it seems like people actually like this film. The only explanation i have for this is that some film buffs think that if a film is not in English it is automatically good. I can&#39;t see any reason why people would like this. this is not an art film it&#39;s of waste of celluloid.(That&#39;s if they actually shot it on film , which they didn&#39;t)

Seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother and appearing in really bad movies. Joe spends most his time walking around dressed in black and looking quite moody. He takes orders from a puffy faced angel of death, who you might recognize as the puffy faced villain from Tango &amp; Cash and as the puffy faced cyborg from Future War. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do and it involves taking some souls of some kids in a big car being driven by a dumb galloot who questions Led Zeppelin. Well, the car crashes and the chase is on. The lucky kids to escape Joe look like Tonya Harding and Rick Springfield. They&#39;re chased around town, break things and Tonya gets leered at by her mom while she&#39;s undressing for a bath. The action winds up at a hospital where we learn that heaven is an elevator ride away. In the end, some green lights flash, Joe shouts and Puffy vanishes without a trace. Wish I could say the same for this movie. Watch it from the relative safety of MST.

I&#39;m a sucker for a good romance, but this one doesn&#39;t qualify as either good or a romance. I had the plot nailed down before the credits were through. With such poor dialog, plot and character development, I suggest investing your hour and a half elsehere. I had to rush out and rent Serendipity for the third time so I could get the bad taste of this one out of my mouth.

The Dekalog 5 may be considered a violent accusation against the death sentence, according to the fifth commandment &#34;Thou shalt not kill&#34;: not by chance it puts the concept of a State fully complied with the provisions of an unjust law on the same plane as the figure of a Murderer. &#34;But the law might not imitate the nature, it might correct it,&#34; states Piotr, the counsel for the defense, a real catalyst character, &#34;the punishment is a form of vengeance aiming at returning evil for evil without preventing the crime. But in the name of whom the law takes its revenge? Really in the name of the innocent ones?&#34;. The horrifying and detailed sequences of the last half hour of a man sentenced to death give value to the uselessness of the deterrent function applied to the death penalty with the purpose of intimidating all potential criminals. &#34;Desperate plights don&#39;t demand desperate remedies&#34;, Kieslowski says in his message, teaching us how unrighteous can be the act of disobedience to a commandment of God that judges punishment the same way as crime is judged. There are three different moral attitudes here: the innate sense of rebellion of the MURDERER aiming at rousing the hostile torpor of the surrounding environment; the strong sense of chronic indifference of the VICTIM inclined to laugh at other people&#39;s requirements; the deserving behavior of the COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENSE always ready to fight against adversity, in favor of human life. The struggle for life is ruthlessly vivisected all of the time; the characters are plunged into scenes of affliction and distress, in an urban landscape accented with greenish tones and seen in its own reflections through the windshield of a taxi. Everything in &#34;Dekalog 5&#34; conveys a dreadful sense of estrangement and isolation: descriptions of a waste undergrowth of violence and folly, scenes of precarious conditions of work, sinister appearances of buildings immersed in an anonymous aura of desolation, aimless wanderings through disenchanting environments. Jazek, the main character, is compelled to struggle with an opponent stronger than himself: a town completely wrapped in profound indifference, apparently hostile, deaf to all his mute calls for help, while a faded photo of a little girl in a first communion dress goes on gnawing his soul. He&#39;s irremediably directing his steps towards a disconnected route to damnation seen through the deformations of the 18 mm. wide angle camera lens aiming at distorting every details, altering the reality, making it fade out in remote and alien echoes. Kieslowski doesn&#39;t bring extenuating circumstances seasoned with honey-tongued tones of melodrama in favor of the defendant, differently from some Hollywood stereotypes like &#34;I want to live&#34; (by Robert Wise). He doesn&#39;t slip on the banana peel of useless pathetic scenes to extenuate Jazek&#39;s guilt and to mitigate the brutality of the crime, not interested at all in proximate psychological motivations to justify any display of extreme or violent behaviors and refusing to include any useless judicial proceedings. In other words, in Kieslowsky&#39;s opinion &#34;a crime is always a crime&#34;: according to the principle of &#34;par condicio&#34; he puts the prosecutor on the same plane as the condemned man, using many signs or symbols to represent a society seen in the most sinister light. And we can&#39;t remain indifferent: even if we don&#39;t agree with him, Jazek&#39;s screams of anguish touch our hearts with pity in the same manner that Terri Schiavo&#39;s entreating eyes do.

While it comes no closer to the Tarzan of Edgar Rice Burroughs than, say, the Johnny Wiesmuller flicks did it does have it&#39;s own peculiar, and entertaining, slant on the story. Its a well done Tarzan movie. Nice scenery, good photography, workable continuity, and a Tarzan yell that echos the one described by Burroughs. The players all perform well. The only bad points I found were, I think, related. It moves slow in places. That slow movement? Makes this picture to long. It could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter, which I think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot line and the character development. But the rest of the film works well enough to carry it over these two rough spots and still leave the viewer satisfied with the flick. Short version of all the above ... Its a very GOOD Tarzan movie.

I&#39;m a big fan of 50s sci-fi, but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper sci-fi flick, the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie. It&#39;s clear he was working with no money, because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever. I have *never* seen so much time-killing in a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are probably less than 60 seconds of &#34;blob footage&#34; in the entire movie, and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorly-written, run-on dialogue. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but good heavens...how could casting have thought anyone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers?

If you like to watch movies because they are pretty, you should be okay with this one. If you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy, then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie, skip it. At the end of the movie i still didn&#39;t know why Stargher killed the women the way he did. When you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from. In Dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasn&#39;t the best, but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained. They also hinted at a dark background for Vaughn&#39;s character but didn&#39;t explain, didn&#39;t really say why Lopez&#39;s child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed, didn&#39;t give much of an explanation for the little kid&#39;s problem, etc. If the rest of the story is compelling, I don&#39;t care about details like how Stargher afforded all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers or why the FBI wasn&#39;t checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killer&#39;s mind thing would work, but I do like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner.

I have seen this film on countless occasions, and thoroughly enjoyed it each time. This is mostly due to the lovely Erika Eleniak- a great actress with incredible looks. Plus, any film starring Tom Berenger and Dennis Hopper is bound to be entertaining.

This movie was crap. The script is so full of holes; I can&#39;t see how the producers agreed to finance it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are never given an explanation of ANYTHING. The acting is horrible. The plot sucks. This movie was obviously written for those 8 and under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say this: why are the high school classes only 2 minutes long? Teacher walks in, finds a frog in the desk, or drawing on the chalkboard, and 30 seconds later, the bell rings, class is over. The kids haven&#39;t even opened their books. Can we have at least a little continuity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the dialogue. Milo Jeter is the re-incarnated, aborted fetus, zombie thing. Do we really need the line, &#34;This is Dr. Jeter&#39;s office. Dr. Jeter, Milo&#39;s father.&#34; Thanks for the tip; I could never put that together myself. It never gets any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does Milo talk the way he does, even in the beginning? Was Milo ever `real&#39;. Or was he never real, just always what he currently is? And if it was always that way, why the unexplained `accident&#39; Milo had?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides &#34;What is Milo?&#34;, what are all the unresolved items for? We see all these contraptions in his father&#39;s medical office, and are never given an explanation of what they are for, or what they have to do with the story. What are the injections for? What about the aquarium contraption? They obviously aren&#39;t needed. (See the movie, it&#39;ll make sense). And what does this medication do to anyone? Apparently nothing, since it has no effect on the lead actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is a very, very bad rip off of all the other slasher movies. It&#39;s a really awful Friday the 13th/Halloween slopped together by a 10-year old writer. It&#39;s not cheesy enough to laugh at, it&#39;s just an incredibly frustrating bore.

This movie is not for the faint or weak of heart. It couldn&#39;t decide if it was going to be porn or legit. It was neither one. It was just bad. There was nothing in this movie to make me want to see anything else made by these people again.

Although credit should have been given to Dr. Seuess for stealing the story-line of &#34;Horton Hatches The Egg&#34;, this was a fine film. It touched both the emotions and the intellect. Due especially to the incredible performance of seven year old Justin Henry and a script that was sympathetic to each character (and each one&#39;s predicament), the thought provoking elements linger long after the tear jerking ones are over. Overall, superior acting from a solid cast, excellent directing, and a very powerful script. The right touches of humor throughout help keep a &#34;heavy&#34; subject from becoming tedious or difficult to sit through. Lastly, this film stands the test of time and seems in no way dated, decades after it was released.

I have a letter from Ms. Knight, who went to college with my older sister. In it, she tells of the hardships of making this film. She, herself, was pregnant--an interesting conjunction with the movie&#39;s plot--and the novice director was unsure, fairly green, and having great difficulties with all the decisions, logistics, etc. They were on the move all the time, and it was a very difficult shoot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film, however, with a strong debut for James Caan, remains effective and affecting. It&#39;s a great showcase for the talent that Ms. Knight has demonstrated her entire career--on television, in movies and on the stage, where she won the Tony for &#34;Kennedy&#39;s Children.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film has aged well.

Wow -- this movie was really bad! You talk about formulaic, typical movie plot? Watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall. The transitions kept trying to be cool but failed. The plot twist at the end, where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected, but doesn&#39;t make much sense until his monologue. Even then... The amount of gore in this movie doesn&#39;t help either. Are all of those images necessary? My last complaint is about the plausibility of chunks of the movie. Would the PD really send a lone officer into an unlit warehouse, subway tunnel, or wherever to find a body, when the location of the perp is unknown? And why does the romance at the end just kind of happen all of a sudden? It&#39;s like the writer was trying to fit in every Hollywood cliche he could. Don&#39;t waste your time seeing this piece of... something.

This movie is one of my very favorites. It&#39;s hard to explain why. Maybe it&#39;s the innocence of Corin Nemec and his awkwardness paired with the boldness of Cheryl Pollak, but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack. Also, some of the characters have little lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves. Finally, the story is one that always tugs at my heartstrings, and the last scene is so bittersweet. All in all, I love this movie; it&#39;s perfect for a gooey, sentimental girls&#39; night.

I remember watching this film in 1981, when I was 7. It was absolutely brilliant! I found the DVD just a couple of months ago. I was nearly jumping up and down with glee!! I bought it and showed it to my kids. They loved it too. They asked what words the seahorse was singing (I didn&#39;t tell them, though, because I don&#39;t think telling the words &#39;gay&#39; and &#39;ecstasy&#39; to 6 year old kids is very good parenting). The songs are brilliant. I still remember them all. I&#39;ll still remember them when I&#39;m 60! There, or near abouts. Tommy Pender is (was) such a brilliant actor. It&#39;s a pity he gave it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find the film, BUY IT! You&#39;ll love it!

Its almost embarrassing to say I even saw this movie. I mean it doesn&#39;t take much to make a good zombie movie besides good special effects, lots of blood and gore, some scary moments and a decent plot. Does House of the Dead 2 do any of these things right? No, not one. Of course, its not as bad as its predecessor, from Uwe Bowle and thats the only thing about this movie that scares me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialog in this movie is notorious, with such lines as &#34;What do you do for a living?&#34; in response &#34;I kill zombies&#34; and &#34;I was never a disk jockey, I was a soldier.&#34; The special effects are embarrassing even for a made for TV movie, I mean seriously, the zombies all look like they have bloody lips are hyped up on crack. The army base in this movie, is a parking garage, with a desk and a open gated room. This movie is so low budget that they couldn&#39;t even get co-ed locker rooms. In fact it seems like this entire movie was filmed in a middle school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, why is it that the all the female soldiers in this movie are models? And for that matter why is everyone in this movie so clueless at to what is going on that they simply just stand around letting the zombies kill them. Heck one guy even trys to give food to the zombie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this movie makes even the worst of Scifi Channel movies looks fantastic.

I really liked the movie &#39;The Emporer&#39;s New Groove&#39;, but watching this was like coming home and seeing your wife having &#34;relations&#34; with a llama. Seriously, this movie was bad. It&#39;s like Club Dread after Super Troopers. I am supposed to write 10 lines, but I don&#39;t even know what else to say. I laughed a couple of times, but only because I was drinking. A movie like that should at least be funny when your drunk. It was not. Maybe llamas are just funny and regular cartoon people aren&#39;t. Either way, just stick with The Emporer&#39;s New Groove if you want a funny, cartoon, llama-themed movie. Line 10 is this line right here.

&#34;Any Gun Can Play&#34; (1967), directed by Enzo G. Castellari, is a very good pastiche of Spaghetti Westerns, especially Leone&#39;s. The first half is great, which, apart from the opening which is a direct nod to &#34;For a Few Dollars More&#34;, with Monco, Colonel Douglas Mortimer and El Indio lookalikes walking into a ghost-town and then promptly killed by a Bounty Hunter called &#34;The Stranger&#34;, is entirely serious, with great gunfights (especially the train-robbing scene), fast and furious action and nice performances from Gilbert Roland, George Hilton and (who manages well, considering that he is badly miscast) Edd Byrnes. But then, when the film reaches the half-way mark, there is a jokey fist-fight between Hilton and Byrnes. It isn&#39;t very funny, and is the weakest part of the film, but it throws everything you have seen previously in a new light. You realise that in fact the whole thing is a spoof of Spaghetti Western conventions, and in retrospect, the first half is so well done that you completely miss this spoof undercurrent. What now follows is a more obvious parody, with even some acrobatic jumping around from Brynes that predates all those seventies Circus Westerns. The ending, a complete send-up of &#34;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&#34; climax, is very well done, as in other hands it could have been very silly. So, a pretty fun Spaghetti Western, that doesn&#39;t take itself too seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Spaghetti Westerns.

Both visually and musically stunning. A treat for both the eye and the ear. The quintessential Victorian element of the opening sequences were completely enchanting, helping to create a Christmas scene of which Dickens himself would have been justifiably proud. Technically the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both imaginatively devised and creatively achieved in a traditional stage setting. The dancing of many of the lead artistes is breathtakingly good. The photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording admirably matches the overall high level of technical skills employed. A great film for all the family at Christmas time and a most delightful discovery which will withstand multiple viewing.

Not even Emeril Lagasse cooking can save this disjointed, overheaded idiotic nonsense, starring emeril lagasse as a TV chef from the food channel,who with help of the crew to try to make the show better, poor plot and stupid script throw this show down the drain, Robert Urich wasted in the poorly supporting role and sadly this was his last one ever(R.I.P.), &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst show of 2001 and it will be on the list of the worst shows of this decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Feel Very Sorry for Emeril Lagasse for making this sitcom, he even said himself it stunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s hard to believe that they are the same producers of designing women that did this mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TV Review: 1 Star

The over-riding problem with this film is that it can&#39;t possibly use Bill Murray to the best of his abilities, simply because of the co-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this was a road movie with another comedic actor, it might work. Even if they were both trying to get the elephant across the country, it would at least allow for them to share some amusing dialogue. As it stands, Murray is left talking to an elephant who cannot answer back with witty banter. Essentially, it means that Murray is talking to himself, and this makes the film more boring than it could have been had he had another character to bounce off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids would enjoy this movie,simply because of the elephant, but anyone wanting to watch Bill Murray&#39;s biting delivery and enjoy an excellent script needs to look somewhere else.

This movie sucked. The problem was not with the cast. I think the cast was great, lots of good talent, lots of great acting. But the script was TERRIBLE! It seemed to be mostly just a frame work in which Steve Carrell could do his improv. And that is what he does best, but it just didn&#39;t work here. The script was hard to follow, the story was non-sensical, and scenes were random and lacked direction. Also, much of the action was extremely contrived and poorly thought out. It was a good effort, but as Max says, they missed it by THAT MUCH! I am shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this stinker here on the IMDb. Obviously, the movie producers are getting people to write lots of positive reviews on their movies and fill up the entries on the IMDb. If you read the positive reviews and compare them to the negative reviews, it is pretty clear which ones are genuine reviews from normal users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was full of problems and jokes that just didn&#39;t work. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchor Man, and I like his comedy and style. But I will tell you that I never once laughed while I was watching this movie. Yes, I had a couple of light moments, a couple of chuckles, but no real laughs. Nothing that struck me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoiler Alert! One ridiculous scene was when Max had his hands binded on the airplane and he goes to the bathroom to try to escape. He uses his special Swiss Army knife...but instead of just using THE BLADE OF THE KNIFE, he tries to SHOOT the binding with his miniature crossbow. And as the crossbow miss-fires and shoots little arrows into him over and over again (almost putting out his EYE), Max doesn&#39;t give up or try the blade instead...no, he just keeps shooting himself with the crossbow. What was he really expecting to do with that crossbow? It seemed to be THE WORST option on the knife to try to remove the bindings. It just made absolutely no sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that made up this movie. They were ridiculous, poorly thought out, poorly motivated, and made of pure nonsense. And that was truly distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, this movie was a big let-down, and I recommend you avoid it. A note to the IMDb: You should do something about these phony reviews that people are leaving. It degrades the authenticity of the site.

The movie starts something like a less hyper-kinetic, more pastiche Dead or Alive: strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers. But when a police officer is killed, one Tatsuhito gets involved... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is also involved, things get bloody quite fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An earlier work of Miike&#39;s, Shinjuku Triad Society is still filled with his usual in the ol&#39; ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts, though it&#39;s not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces. Rather, it&#39;s a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction, as Tatsuhito digs his way through the underground, a maze that leads him to a gay Triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from Taiwan and keeps an almost-brothel of young boys (one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning). Tatsuhito&#39;s brother is getting involved with said society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship Tatsuhito has with his nemesis, Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, later moved back into Japan, and alienated for it. Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, so killed his father and developed a crime wing in Japan. Wang also is a surprisingly Shakespearian character, which is weird enough as it is, much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with Tatsuhito comes to be. And Tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he&#39;s forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother. While it would be rude to state that Miike&#39;s movies are successful mostly on their shock value, it is true that sometimes it&#39;s easy to lose track of how well Miike can create bitter, dis-impassioned characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--PolarisDiB

The daytime TV of films. Seldom have I felt so little attachment to characters. Seldom have I been made to cringe by such dire dialogue. Nauseous London thirty-somethings mincing round lurid BBC sets spouting platitudinous mulch. Avoid this film as if it were your grandmother&#39;s clunge.

This could have been a very good film, a very interesting look at ancient tradition and oral history, but it should have been a short subject. As it is , it moves at a snail&#39;s pace; sure that&#39;s part of the life being portrayed, but this was unbearable. I fell asleep watching them make soup and that was a highlight.

Do you know what farmers spray on fields ? That&#39;s right - Manure , so when the BBC decided to make a much hyped conspiracy thriller about GMOs and farming what we got was some of the smelliest manure the BBC has inflicted upon its audience &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!!! SPOILERS !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIELDS OF GOLD opens with a bunch of masked scientists in a lab where a female scientist ( According to the right on trendy BBC all scientists are women ) announces &#34; A new strain of wheat that will save the third world from hunger &#34; then the story switches to another equally bland scene . If you&#39;re going to make a thriller of any type shouldn&#39;t you open with a hook that grabs the audience ? DOCTOR WHO was brilliant at this as was THE X- FILES while 28 DAYS LATER opened with a hook that took place in a laboratory. I guess someone at the BBC didn&#39;t think this thriller needed a hook because the viewers had trailers stuffed down their throat for weeks in advance &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the ( Not very exciting ) story continues a couple of journalists ( One&#39;s a drunken man with morals lower than Bill Clinton and Dubya Bush combined while the other is a female journalist full of virtue ) investigating patients at a county hospital who might be getting bumped off via &#34; Mercy killings &#34; . It&#39;s at this point things start getting confused as the female journalist is threatened by MI5 spooks and the first episode ends with the main MI5 spook getting murdered &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second episode reveals that the patients at the county hospital have actually been dying due to being infected with a VRSA superbug . This is when things go totally hay wire . All throughout FIELDS OF GOLD the audience have been led to believe the intelligence services and the company shown in the opening sequence have been behind the deaths - But they&#39;re not . It turns out the bad guy is an organic farmer who has been manufacturing the VRSA superbug in his bedroom and the story ends via THE MATRIX camera work with the drunken male journalist setting fire to a field ridden with VRSA thereby spreading the superbug throughout the land &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it impossible to say a good word about FIELDS OF GOLD . At the time of its broadcast I was both a member of the Scottish Green Party and Greenpeace . I have since renounced my time in the environmental movement but even now I am somewhat offended by how environmentalists are portrayed here and to have the bad guy spreading a fatal genetically engineered virus as a warning to the dangers of genetically modified organisms is very silly. It&#39;s a bit like a CND member letting off a nuke in London to warn of the dangers of nuclear war . I was also slightly offended as to how the male characters were written as being bastards while all the females were highly intelligent and morally superior to men . There&#39;s also other problems with the script especially with regard to VRSA . If unlike the scriptwriters you take the time and trouble to research VRSA you&#39;ll find it&#39;s entirely different from what is seen here . Oh and if you set fire to diesel it doesn&#39;t explode like napalm . Perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it resembles JEEPERS CREEPERS structure wise whereby the last ten minutes contradicts most of what has gone before . Where as JEEPERS CREEPERS only lasted about 90 minutes FIELDS OF GOLD lasted twice that length so is doubly irritating and illogical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a footnote environmentalism never makes a good theme for a thriller ( Anyone remember those Steven Segal movies ? ) and it&#39;s about time TV and film producers realized this

Terry Gilliam&#39;s fantastic, twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the Earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic, dizzying, and highly stylized film that boasts Bruce Willis&#39; best performance ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What sets 12 Monkeys apart from most time-travel sci-fi movies is that Bruce Willis character actually deals with what the psychological effects of time-travel, that is, not knowing what reality is actual reality: the place that the time-traveler comes from or goes to. Also, the film recognizes that things that have past cannot be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this case the release of said virus, cannot be stopped or changed. As Willis asserts &#34;It&#39;s already happened,&#34; while he&#39;s in a mental hospital, the major dilemma the film trudges into is not a trite, overdone plot to save the world; instead it&#39;s Willis&#39; inner struggle to simply survive himself. It&#39;s a fresh, innovative concept, and it works beautifully thanks to a tautly written script by Peoples and Gilliam&#39;s unique brand of dementia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides this, 12 Monkey&#39;s storytelling is totally non-linear and instead opts to distort and bend the way the story is told skillfully incorporating a bevy of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past, the future, and even a scene that is lifted out of Hitchcock&#39;s Vertigo. All serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visually, Gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling Tim Burton in his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery. With cold, wide, and immersing cinematography, Gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness of his characters. The scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, dead white and help serve as a contrast to the often veering-on-madness characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance-wise, Brad Pitt steals most scenes, filling them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him an Oscar nomination. As mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying Cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman. Equally good is Madeline Stowe as Willis&#39; psychologist. She holds her own, injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe is a false &#39;religion.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gilliam&#39;s expert, overwhelming, and complex handling of what could have been a routine action/sci-fi film makes 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape. Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness. Ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film brimming with brilliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 out of 10

Well, you might not actually SEE any women in love in this movie, but you&#39;ll certainly hear women TALKING about love, and men talking about love, and women talking about men, and men talking about women, and men talking about men, and everyone talking about death, and talking, and talking, until you yourself will want to scream and do something that requires no talking at all, like paint your bedroom or water your plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the world of D.H. Lawrence, where psycho-babble reigns supreme, and where no one can get down to living a productive life because everyone is too busy talking about how unproductive their lives are. Spending time with the characters in a D.H. Lawrence novel is like being locked in a closet with a group of your most self-absorbed acquaintances who you would run away from if you met them at a party. When I read &#34;Women in Love,&#34; I so desperately wanted to strangle every single character in it, but since I couldn&#39;t, I was hoping they would at least strangle each other. Alas, only one of them dies, not by strangulation, and I won&#39;t spoil it for you by telling which one, in case you actually give a damn about this story or any of these people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give director Ken Russell his due, he makes this filmed version about as entertaining as it&#39;s possible to make this essentially unfilmable novel. He throws out much of the psychological mumbo-jumbo that Lawrence adored, and focuses instead on all of the naughty parts, so we get lots of histrionic lovemaking in beds and fields, two buck naked men wrestling by firelight, and one embarrassing scene featuring Alan Bates (yup, buck naked again) roaming around in a meadow making love to bushes and grass (I&#39;m not kidding). Glenda Jackson won an Oscar for her performance as Gudrun, the more dominant of the two sisters at the story&#39;s focus, and she certainly tries her hardest to do something with this material; anyone would deserve an Oscar simply for having to bear Russell&#39;s decision to give her a scene where she has to dance wildly in front of a herd of mystified-looking cattle. Oliver Reed has one expression, an intense glower. The whole thing is over-written and over-directed, and it&#39;s deliriously campy. Indeed, this vies with &#34;Mommie Dearest&#34; as perhaps the most unintentionally hysterical movie I&#39;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: D

I have searched for this movie for years. I have great memories of the first-rate acting and singing in this movie. I never knew that the reason the movie was unobtainable was because of the actions of the Gershwin family -- SHAME ON THEM for trying to suppress at American Classic!! I can only hope they will relent and allow this movie to be release and enjoyed by the American public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sammy Davis, Jr. is at his absolute best in this film. The only other performance of his this is it&#39;s equal was in &#39;Anna Lucasta&#39;--another terrific film that I wish would be released on DVD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Porgy &amp; Bess contained a first-rate, all-star cast. Hopefully one day you&#39;ll get to see for yourself.

If it wasn&#39;t for Colin Firth, the movie would be ready for the dust bin! So foreseable, so silly and so badly acted!! Only Colin Firth, as always, shines through this mess as single light on the end of the tunnel!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst was Jennifer Rubin&#39;s acting, for sure! Maybe it was because of this script (did they actually have really written one or was it just made up &#34;on the way&#34;???).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To cut a tooo long story short:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a MUST SEE only for Colin Firth Fanatics (like me) since he is incredibly sexy and good acting (struggling hard against this &#34;mentally challenged&#34; script). These minutes of Colin-Screen-Time make up a lot of this movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t spend too much money on it, though. Try to see or get it as cheap as possible (an auction or something like that) and then do stick to the Colin Firth scenes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the movie might be dangerous for anyones mental health.

This movie is full of pseudo deep thoughtfulness and it&#39;s cloying in its writerly-ness, that includes a canned ham voice-over and some unbelievable dialogue. Dialogue that is tinny and tone deaf the way Spike sometimes (not always) is when writing &#34;certain&#34; characters. For those that like nonsense films like Pieces of April and One Hour Photo, this is another one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this comment is nothing against Ryan Gosling who has shown his awesome chops in The Believer. A film that proves that movies are a director&#39;s medium, and when a movie is rotten it&#39;s fair to say the fault lies there and not in the actors.

The reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point. It&#39;s obvious he hasn&#39;t been young or innocent in a very long time, or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well-meaning young characters actually thought they COULD make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace. If only it was that easy. But the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better, as the situation gets worse and worse every single day. Well, if you&#39;re not part of the solution, you&#39;re part of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The central theme is that revenge begets more revenge, which begets even more, in an ever-expanding bloodbath. Both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side, which they think justify their committing even MORE in retaliation. Where does it end? And apparently he missed the significance of &#34;the bubble&#34; referred to in the name, which was that people living in Tel Aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them, which is partly why they seemed so naive. (He also seemed to think that Ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem, which tells me he wasn&#39;t paying attention when Ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it very brave of the director, the screenplay writer, and both star-crossed lovers, to update the Romeo &amp; Juliet story to a modern troubled land, and to make both lovers male. Let&#39;s be honest here: Very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female (young love wins all hearts) -- but when people&#39;s uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that, incredibly, these same people would rather have them HATE each other, then the conclusion is inevitable.

This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film. Billy Dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands. It&#39;s fairly gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters but still it&#39;s not that interesting either and Billy Dee&#39;s character, though maltreated by white authority figures, doesn&#39;t really come off as sympathetic. It&#39;s also hurt by it&#39;s extremely low budget. Still, it&#39;s interesting to look at as it&#39;s a good depicttion of 1970s social issues.

I watched the whole movie, waiting and waiting for something to actually happen. Maybe it&#39;s my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology? Is it a weird re-telling of the Oedipal myth: I want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him? I didn&#39;t understand why certain plot elements were even present: why was the construction upstairs, why was there that big stairwell with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their doom if no one was actually going to do so, why have the scenes at all with the father at work, why have such a nice kitchen if you&#39;re only going to eat takeout, why would the boy want to be baptized and the parents be the ones to resist instead of the other way around. I see lots of good reviews for this movie...has my taste been corrupted by going up with 70s b-movies and old sci fi flicks?

The obvious parallels between Walt Disney&#39;s charming fantasy Bedknobs and Broomsticks and C.S. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia are pretty apparent. There are more coincidences here than comparing Bedknobs and Broomsticks than with Mary Poppins even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two Disney films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like The Chronicles of Narnia it involves some English children leaving London during the blitz and coming to live in the country. And those kids have to deal with a world of magic. But unlike C.S. Lewis the Rawlins kids have the magic invade their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now. No retreating to a fantasy kingdom like the Pevensie kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No heavy duty philosophy here from Walt Disney except maybe it&#39;s not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like Angela Lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like David Tomlinson. Ms. Lansbury didn&#39;t get to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing. She carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at Disney couldn&#39;t top. And they won an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in that department for this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two performers made their farewell to films in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O&#39;Shea played her last role in this film, she graced many a film in the United Kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers. And that grand character actor Reginald Owen as the retired general who leads the Old Home Guard in war and in song bids adieu to film audiences around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The team of Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman who wrote the score for Mary Poppins wrote a good and serviceable one here. The Age Of Not Believing was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to the Theme from Shaft. Personally though I do like David Tomlinson&#39;s tribute to that most colorful of London streets, Portabello Road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years. Imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics.

RKO studios decided to borrow both William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia, for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of The Thin Man. They succeeded to some degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than Nick Charles, Bill Powell also played in a few Philo Vance films in the title role. So by this time he was pretty well set in the role. Doctor Bradford is not doing as many liquid lunches as Nick Charles, but the basic blasé Nick is still there. One difference is that while Nick Charles married an heiress, Doctor Bradford works for a living as a physician. That helps in his avocation of detective and in fact it does in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#39;s got two murders to solve. A jockey falls off a horse coming into the homestretch of a big race and dies for no apparent reason. The trainer suspects something afoot, but he&#39;s bumped off by the more conventional method of a bullet. This is after he comes to Bill Powell for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myrna Loy was a more steadying influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur was. Arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than Loy did. But it works here and she and Powell have good chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ever dependable James Gleason is the police inspector in the Sam Levene/Nat Pendleton role. All they needed here was Asta and possibly Eric Blore as Powell&#39;s butler was essaying that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Powell and Arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of Bradford films.

The last person who dies before New Years, is cursed to drive the Phantom Carriage for a whole year, picking up the souls of the dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a scene from this old silent Swedish horror film on Youtube, and decided to track down the whole movie. It was well worth the work finding it, because it&#39;s an absolutely amazing movie for the time it was made. It has a wonderfully eerie atmosphere. The old time horror film makers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere. Sadly, many of today&#39;s film makers don&#39;t seem to understand how important setting and atmosphere are, and go for the cheap jump scares. The visual effects are excellent, considering its date of production. If you can find a copy of this, I highly recommend giving it a watch. 9/10

It would be great if a discussion on this medium length film is initiated with a brief tale about hypocrisy of Hollywood people.It was in 1988 that Chuck Norris saw this film at Cannes International Film Festival.He made a silly remark by uttering that the senseless killing depicted in Dekalog 5 is far more effective than killings which have been filmed in his Hollywood films with him as a potent action star.He was speaking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in Kieslowski&#39;s film by a reckless psychopath who hits him cruelly with a big stone.There should be absolutely no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human society.This is the reason why Chuck Norris&#39; statement appears as a cruel joke which defends violent means in a society which is increasing becoming restless.An honest reviewer would not be making a mistake if he/she states that Kieslowski&#39;s film &#34;Dekalog: Dekalog,Piec (#1.5)&#34; has universal connotations.This is because the events depicted in Dekalog 5 can happen in any part of world.The best lesson which Kielowski gives to us concerns levels of violence which are acceptable in a just society.This is the reason why the brutal slaying of an innocent cab driver is capable of causing a feeling of repugnance in us.We would not feel the same hatred for homicide when it appears in films featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger,Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme as they appear much too artificial.One can easily grasp that special effects and modern studio techniques can charm only toddlers but make no sense to serious film enthusiasts.Kieslowski also champions helplessness of human beings in rescuing fellow humans beings from the clutches of death and misery.This is particularly interesting as time and again it has been proved that strict laws and capital punishments have not been able to prevent homicide.

The &#34;Wrinkle in Time&#34; book series is my favorite series from childhood. I have read and re-read them more times than I can count over the last 35+ years. The characters, with all their virtues and flaws, are near and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful, magical, spiritual story that I love so much. To say I was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never read the book(s) I imagine you will enjoy the movie. The acting is passable, the special effects are well done for a made for TV movie, and the story is interesting. However, if you love the books, avoid this movie at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this statement at the Wikipedia page of the novel: &#34;In an interview with Newsweek, L&#39;Engle said of the film, &#39;I expected it to be bad, and it is.&#39;&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, like another reviewer here, feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind.

In this follow up to The Naked Civil Servant we see the final years of Quentin Crisp&#39;s life in New York. John Hurt is again Crisp (come on who else could play the part?) and its a role he inhabits to the point of disappearing. For me Hurt is Crisp and I&#39;ve always found it very hard to take the man himself because Hurt was more him than he was himself. Its masterful performance. His equal is Denis O&#39;Hare as Phillip Steele, Crisp&#39;s long time friend and confidant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately outside of the performances the film has little to recommend it. To be certain the film gets the details right. Filmed in and around New York the film the film looks and feels like New York and its environs, but dramatically its kind of inert. Its Crisp talking to people being witty,trying to come to terms with the world as it is (he ended up regretting some poorly chosen words concerning AIDS) and dealing with the infirmities that old aged thrust upon him. Quentin the man is always interesting, but his life as portrayed is really not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed by the film. I&#39;ve always admired the man and his unique point of view. I just wish he was better served by this film about his life.

Here we&#39;ve got an intelligent mixture of typical hongkongmovieshootouts, worlddestructionthemes and intelligent filmmaking. Not that the script has not its big holes and a few specialeffects are a bit cheaplooking. But the cinematography is a optical treat and the soundtrack is first rate. The blend of fast actionsequences and colorful slow, sometimes nearly poetic parts, has no comparison in its kind of movie, so a classification is rather hard. The closest genre is a disaster or terroristmovie with deeper human and political notes than usual. Well worth to be seen worldwide in cinemas. But i am hoping this for so many other (mostly asian) movies before and nobody seems to believe me. Unfortunately.

This is an early one from the boys, but some people may not be satisfied with this one like all the others. I found it to be different somehow than the your average Stooge slapstick. It was more funny for it&#39;s jokes rather than the poke in the eye or slap. Watch for a hilarious part when Larry grabs the stethoscope from Moe and sings into it. Moe gives him a good smack. That part made me crack up for a good ten minutes. Another hit for the Stooges.

OK with Coolio in it I should have known better! But Noooooooo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 3 mins you&#39;ve encountered 5 bites from other movies &amp; and TV shows...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 mins Casper Van Dien should have learnt by now! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 mins you&#39;re feeling sorry for Tom &#39;Tiny&#39; Lister Jr. that he has been reduced to doing movies like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 mins Erika Eleniak Shows up looking like Zena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 mins you&#39;re ready to shoot you&#39;re self...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How these movies receive funding is beyond me! And yes I watched the whole thing. The Ending is priceless!!! Just stay away!

This is an OK film but lacks any real depth either emotionally or in terms of story telling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none, also no real suspense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washington is believable in the lead but he is sleep walking through it, there is no scope to flex any acting muscles for him or the supporting cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story simply falls a little flat, even having never heard of the title character the ending was obvious but unlike other films about such injustices this one has no emotional impact, you don&#39;t really care about him and the motivations of those on the outside helping seem more academic than concerned for his welfare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an attempt to inject some emotion using the boy outside who hero worships Carter but this seems forced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s an OK film but instantly forgettable.

I saw this film at its premier at Sundance 09.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since American Beauty is a movie that had something to say, I had hopes for Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, of countless movies I&#39;ve seen in almost a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I&#39;ve ever wanted to walk out early from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst problem with Towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of &#34;provocative&#34; concepts concerning cultural stereotypes, rather than with an organic human drama. The screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian. The famous Edith Wharton quote comes to mind: I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author&#39;s political views. That observation is especially devastating for Towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic. If there ever was a time when Towelhead&#39;s white male villains, condescending portrayals of blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., were fresh, it&#39;s long past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a more detailed review, please look up any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled. As you read through the reviews in this and similar sites, you&#39;ll frequently come across superlatives: &#34;stunning,&#34; &#34;breathtaking,&#34; &#34;profound,&#34; &#34;shocking,&#34; ... It embarrasses me to read them, but it does not surprise me. Indeed, I&#39;ve encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial, cultural, gender, or sexual issues as deeply moving, thought provoking, full of profound insight. If you are such a person, by all means, rent Towelhead and be moved by it. On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can safely pass on this one.

Imagine what it must have been like for John Agar. One of Hollywood&#39;s handsome leading men. Married to Shirley Temple for five years. He finds himself doing movies like this. I remember him in &#34;Tarantula&#34; where he wasn&#39;t half bad. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this film. The monster is dumb uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. The teenagers are boring. The plot is stupid. People run around. There are events that do nothing to advance the plot. There&#39;s dancing that goes on and on, and then there is no attack. There is some idiotic love triangle that no one could care the least about. It isn&#39;t even campy or outrageous. It&#39;s just no worth anything. Agar might as well have been a post. He&#39;s given nothing to do.

Seven Pounds stars Will Smith as Ben Thomas, an IRS collection agent who has an ulterior motive for meeting those who have gotten behind on their tax payments. Thomas caused the deaths of seven people whilst driving talking on his phone and the movie follows his attempt to try and atone for his, quite frankly, unforgivable crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story line is as subtle as a brick through a green house window. What you see is exactly what is happening - even the ending of Titanic was more surprising when compared to Seven Pounds. There is absolutely no twist whatsoever, there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I only like Will Smith when is in full Bad Boys mode. The guy is at his best when sporting a gun, driving a Ford GT and saying &#34;Aw Hell Nah&#34; as whenever he tries to act serious it only comes across as a pathetic attempt at trying to gain an Oscar which he is so obviously is desperate for. This is probably the main reason why I wasn&#39;t looking forward to the movie, although here he is very understated. There are flashes of comedy but they are subtle, in fact it was the most understated Will Smith performance I have ever seen and for that reason alone he was fantastic and ironically should be nominated for a major award.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supporting cast were all grand too - Rosario Dawson looked pretty much at deaths door the whole film and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were fine as where all the other bit players.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a weepy - but it isn&#39;t throwing all the usual clichés and sentimental violins to give you no other choice but to cry. There were a few times that even my hardened heart nearly broke. You will be hard pressed not to find one of the situations that does not relate to your own life which makes it seem all the more real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 8/10. The Will Smith show moves onto drama without all the desperation of The Pursuit of Happiness and comes of all the better for it.

Great artists, always suffered while they were young. I could mention Mozart and Beethoven, but that is not the point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was made by H-G Clouzot whose family wanted him to succeed in the Law professions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its main star is Louis Jouvet who studied and practiced as as pharmacist before becoming &#34;The Greatest Actor&#34; and also director of France&#39;s Theater before and after WWII.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both had health problems. Clouzot had TB while young, Jouvet had cardiac problems and died on a theater..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such events shape the character of men (and women, of course). One might even say that today&#39;s Artists are so poor, because they had never suffered and fought for their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, this is the greatest of Clouzot&#39;s movies. &#34;Wages of Fear&#34; is greater in &#34;suspense&#34;, &#34;Diabolique&#34; also has more &#34;suspense&#34; and a better plot and is more about &#34;female evil&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quai des Orfèvres is more human. Clouzot was falsely accused by De Gaulle&#39;s entourage (mostly communists and Jews) of collaboration with the Nazis and banned from making films until until De Gaulle left France&#39;s Government in early 1946. De Gaulle came back in 1958, as President.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main characters are all good souls: Jenny L&#39;Amour may perform as a &#34;putain&#34; on stage, but she is not a &#34;whore&#34; (dictionaires make synonyms of those words, but they are not the same), loves her husband, and refuses the slight &#34;advances from her (presumably Lesbian) friend Dora, the photographer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maurice the husband is jealous and timid, but runs away from the scene of the crime. He is a coward because he fell in love with a woman and traded an eventually more upscale career for love..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antoine, the detective (interpreted by the great Louis Jouvet, basically a stage actor, performs in this French &#34;Gray&#34; not Noir, as well as E.G. Robinson in &#34;Double Indemnity&#34;) shows flair for pseudo criminals, tenderness for a Negro son(?), and compassion for the true author of the crime, because he remembers that is father cleaned the latrines at some nobleman&#39;s château!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clouzot was capable of slapping an actor&#39;s face in order to put him in the right frame of mind, but deep inside he was very human. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have his horoscope in front of me. He had Venus in Sagittarius which means open-heartedness, devotion, charity and altruism. For those who do not believe in Astrology, my most sincere apologies...

Notable because of it&#39;s notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous Maruschka Detmers takes her young lover&#39;s penis from his trousers and into her mouth. Even without this moment the film is a splendid if slightly disturbing passionate and blindingly sexy ride. Detmers puts in a great performance as the partly deranged, insatiable delight, wandering about her flat nude. Dressed, partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fiancé is released whilst fellow terrorists are released, she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else as she weeps, beautifully of course!

This film is about aging Geisha in post war Tokyo. Okin, played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara, lends money to two other ex Geisha, Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki) and they resent the way she is somewhat smug about it. Tamae has a son, Otomi a daughter, who during the film announce they&#39;re leaving them while Okin, never a mother, gets visits from two men in her past who, it turns out, just want money from her. Its a compelling tale of what choices you make, what you do to get through life and who you&#39;re responsible and beholden to. Haruko Sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country and she plays the mostly unyielding, less than compassionate Okin with an air of superiority that makes you not like her, but at the same time almost envy her. At a time when great films were made by Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinoshita and Kurosawa, amongst others, Mr. Naruse is right up there with him. If you have a region free DVD player, you should attempt to find the two Naruse box sets released in England. I think this film was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant. That they are really not makes this film a veritable masterpiece.

Leno talks through his punch lines. This spoils the joke, for those of you who haven&#39;t figured it out. His show is held in a micro sized studio for a reason, or two reasons -- the small amount of laughter will be amplified, and few want to see him. Letterman&#39;s set is the polar opposite -- Ed Sullivan would be proud and the balcony is always full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NBC, tacky NBC, will never get it. Founder David Sarnoff&#39;s megalomaniacal enterprise continues to be all about the money. At least CBS has a bit of a family feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leno collects cars, or is it stamps, while Letterman races cars. The difference is informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I chatted I used to ask other chatters to email me if Leno _ever_ said something that was funny. I never got a single email. Letterman has superb timing. He also can re-use the most unfunny joke in such a way that it becomes one of the funniest things in that night&#39;s show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Letterman has built other careers. Paul is now well known and respected in his own musical right. Even Paul&#39;s other band members get recognition and career boosting. Biff Henderson has become a name America knows of. Even the businesses in the same block as the Ed Sullivan theater get a boost. What has Leno ever done for anyone else? Personally, I am glad that Dave moved and Leno got the Carson gig. I never watched NBC shows before and had no reason to after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Top Ten list is an American icon. So is Letterman. Leno is a caricaturist&#39;s dream, nothing more.

COME ON!!! They did that on purpose!! Two of my current faves on TV (Meloni from &#34;Oz&#34; and &#34;L and O-SVU&#34; and Janel from &#34;West Wing&#34;) hook up for a nice little sleeper/character study. Plot&#39;s nothing fancy, but the acting is right on the mark. Tim Busfield shows up for some neat bits. Worth a look.

This ranks up there as the worst movies of all time. No research or thought at all went into this movie. Action scenes were thrown in at random intervals which made no sense in the context of the movie. Items appeared and disappeared at random, etc. It&#39;s obvious that this was directed by a &#34;stunt coordinator&#34;, who should go back to his old job. The Skeleton Man rode a horse throughout the movie, which amazingly, could change color at will. Either that, or someone thought the audience would all be colorblind and not notice. Blood would be on the actors in 1 scene and the very next, miraculously disappear and then reappear. Seems that everyone connected with this movie forgot to check for inconsistencies.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to reviewers, the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year-old college kids about to enter grad school. Jolly joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1955? The synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet, but there it is on the bandstand. The Ford Pony Car was not invented yet, but there it is playing oldies music. The synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970&#39;s. The Pony Car at best is from the mid 1960&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 year-old college kids? Josh Brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made-for-TV movie was produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their TV&#39;s.

To review this movie, I without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in Tarantino&#39;s &#34;Pulp Fiction&#34; (1994) when Jules and Vincent are talking about Mia Wallace and what she does for a living. Jules tells Vincent that the &#34;Only thing she did worthwhile was pilot&#34;. Vincent asks &#34;What the hell is a pilot?&#34; and Jules goes into a very well description of what a TV pilot is: &#34;Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show&#39;s called a &#39;pilot&#39;. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they&#39;re going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don&#39;t, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.&#34; Now to stretch on what Jules was talking about, there are BILLIONS of television shows/pilots that were never aired because they simply were not...well, good. Probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is &#34;W*A*L*T*E*R&#34;, a spin-off to &#34;M*A*S*H&#34; with Gary &#34;Radar&#34; Burghoff as the lead. Hmmm, would somebody really want to be watching Radar for a half-hour trying to solve crimes? Hence, the show was never picked up. What many people don&#39;t know (or what they thought they knew) is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air, for they are made strictly for the Television networks for them to decide. Some have made they&#39;re way past and got onto the air (The pilot for the animated series &#34;American Dad&#34; comes to mind, as the show&#39;s serial itself didn&#39;t begin until nearly four months later. However, there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air, and this here is why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Black Bart&#34;, a supposed tie-in with the Mel Brooks comedy classic, &#34;Blazing Saddles&#34;, is a stale and bland &#34;sitcom&#34; with little heart and no soul. &#34;Saddles&#34; was a controversial comedy, nevertheless, with it&#39;s racist humor and vulgar comedy, which comes to mind &#34;what idiot decided this would make a great television show FOR PRIME TIME TV?!?&#34; I say &#34;supposed&#34;, because none of the memorable characters from the movie, aside from Bart, on in this mess of a TV show. Mel Brooks wasn&#39;t even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line (In a related story, I recently found out about an unaired TV pilot for a series based on the movie &#34;Clerks.&#34; that Kevin Smith was no involved in....you see what happens?!?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set somewhere around the same time as the movie (or at all), the story circles around the only Black sheriff in the wild west, named appropriately &#39;Black&#39; Bart, who is this time played by future Academy Award winner Louis Gossett Jr., obviously before his stint in &#34;real&#34; acting, whereas in this he is playing a &#34;G-rated&#34; Richard Pryor. Most of the other characters are carbon (if not, really bad) copies of the characters in the movie: Jim, The Waco Kid is replaced by a similar looking character named Reb Jordan, a former Confederate soldier who is quick with the gun. Lilian Von Schtupp is now Belle Buzzer, a more of a ripoff of the character being that she&#39;s a show dancer and a German with a Marlene Dietrich-type accent and personality. While that&#39;s pretty much the end in similarities, The lead &#34;bad guy&#34; in the story is Fern Malaga, played by Noble Willingham, who I assumed would&#39;ve been Hedley Lamar if Warner Bros. secured the rights to the name (See trivia for &#34;Blazing Saddles&#34;) and his son Curley...I dunno, Taggart I suppose? The story is a poor excuse for a sitcom, much less a pilot. Bart deals with the mayor&#39;s drunk son and he&#39;s out-of-control behavior which has caused the town to spin. Really, it&#39;s a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the &#34;series&#34; and doesn&#39;t focus on the variety and context that would make this an &#34;alright&#34; show. I can&#39;t really call it a sitcom (and even if I wanted to) and that&#39;s primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at Warner Bros. Studios and later added a laugh track, so the show is set up almost exactly like &#34;M*A*S*H&#34; (complete with a bland and dull &#34;laughing&#34; that is identical to the series). The acting is so-so, but there&#39;s one part that always make me laugh, and that&#39;s when the actor playing Reb Jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue. HA! The script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie (Surprisingly, they use the word &#34;N***er&#34; numerous amount of times through a 22-minute episode, rather touchy for it&#39;s time period and even for today) and it gets repetitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of sssss...surly interesting novelty item, watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots (It&#39;s on the collector&#39;s edition of &#34;Blazing Saddles&#34;, God knows why). There, yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie-in pilots never air.

### Spoilers! ### &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is this movie offering? Out of control editing and cinematography that matches up with a terrible plot. It is sad to see Denzel Washington&#39;s talents go wasted in trashes like this.We are certainly hinted how the Mexicans cannot save themselves, outside forces needed, possibly militaristic, American ones. And we know the father is a shady character, he is a Mexican after all, unlike the wife who appreciates Creasey more because he is American. He killed all of them thinking she died. And did she? Of course, she won&#39;t, she is a young kid and you are not supposed to hurt the sensibilities of the Hollywood fan. The trade off scene was the only thing that prevents me from rating it below the &#34;implausibly successful&#34;(as some critic pointed out)&#39;Taken&#39;. The nausea of such movies will take time to go. It is in the rating of such movies that we have to doubt IMDb&#39;s credulity.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Go figure! Mine will be in the range of 3.5-4.0

The first step to getting off of that road that leads to nowhere is recognizing that you&#39;re on it in the first place; then it becomes a matter of being assertive and taking positive steps to overcome the negative influences in your life that may have put you on that road to begin with. Which is exactly what a young Latino girl does in `Girlfight,&#39; written and directed by Karyn Kusama. Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) is an eighteen-year-old High School senior from the projects in Brooklyn, facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester. She affects a `whatever&#39; attitude which masks a deep-seated anger that threatens to take her into places she&#39;d rather not go. She lives with her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), with whom she has a very tentative relationship, and her younger brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago). With her life teetering on the brink of dissolution, she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her. And one day she finds it, without even looking for it, when she stops by the gym where Tiny trains. Ironically, Tiny wants nothing to do with boxing; he wants to go to art school, but Sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets, and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons. When Diana convinces Tiny&#39;s trainer, Hector (Jaime Tirelli), to take her on, and approaches her father for the money, under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance (she doesn&#39;t want him to know what she wants the money for), Sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money. Ultimately, with Tiny&#39;s help she finds a way, and the ring soon becomes her second home. It&#39;s an environment to which she readily adapts, and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better. And the fact that she will have to fight men, not women, in `gender blind&#39; competitions, does not faze her in the least. Diana has found her element.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	First time writer/director Karyn Kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story, presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead-end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere. And there&#39;s no candy coating on it, either; as Hector tells Diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is, `I was a fighter once. I lost.&#39; Then, looking around the busy gym, `Like most of these guys, they&#39;re going to lose, too. But it&#39;s all they know--&#39; And it&#39;s that honesty of attitude, as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed, that makes this movie as good as it is. It&#39;s a bleak world, underscored by the dimly lit, run-down gym-- you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers-- and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall, blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have, all that they know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Making her screen debut, Michelle Rodriguez is perfectly cast as Diana, infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves. She is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really Rodriguez; exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin? Whatever it is, it works. It&#39;s a powerful, memorable performance, by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation. She certainly makes Diana a positive role model, one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life, at least to those who would seek them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	As positive as this film is, however, it ends on something of an ambiguous note; though Diana obviously has her feet on the ground, there&#39;s no indication of where she&#39;s headed. Is this a short term fix for her, or is she destined to become the female counterpart of Hector? After all, realistically (and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film), professional boxing isn&#39;t exactly a profession that lends itself to, nor opens it&#39;s arms to women. And in keeping with the subject matter of the film, and the approach of the filmmaker, an affirmation of the results of Diana&#39;s assertiveness would have been appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	The supporting cast includes Santiago Douglas (Adrian), Elisa Bocanegra (Marisol), Alicia Ashley (Ricki) and Thomas Barbour (Ira). Though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify, there are certain aspects of `Girlfight,&#39; that stretch credibility a bit, regarding some of what happens in the ring. That aside, it&#39;s a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience. I rate this one 7/10. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Trey&#39;s favourite from the first run of Season 10 and also one of my personal favourites, Manbearpig features the adventure of Al Gore before going on global warming and before the movie, it was similar a adventure certainly, Al Gore was also trying to aware the world about something that can change the Earth, something really dangerous, this time about something that is half man half bear and half pig, Al Gore had only one thing in mind: to aware everyone of Manbearpig and to kill it! Al Gore here is more than hilarious, everyone who sees him feel sorry for him and yes he can childish, doing tantrums since nobody believes him but he is just a f****** demented bastard. Basically four kids are trapped in a cave because of Al Gore but certainly he don&#39;t have that in his mind, there&#39;s not space for any other subject, is just Manbearpig what concerns Al Gore. Those four kids are Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan, basically Stan felt sorry for AL Gore and the four boys were just playing in Al Gore&#39;s game never imaging that Gore could almost kill them while he was trying to kill Manbearpig (hilarious scene- &#34;they are just children, damned Manbearpig&#34;). So at this part we have on one hand all the stuff with the rescue team who also feel sorry for Al Gore and on the other hand we have a little yet extremely hilarious Cartman episode and there are not surprises of the attitude of Cartman after he finds a treasure inside the cave, certainly the whole stuff with this treasure is fantastic and is great because you will see a sick Cartman in both senses, he is really sick for the boys and really sick for us. And in the end Al Gore does killed Manbearpig! This character is a fantastic one and I&#39;m cereal! Terrific fun in this episode, a highly re-watchable one. 10 out of 10

I think they really let the quality of the DVD production get away from them. I rented this DVD from 2 movie stores and the second time I finally got it to play on the 3rd DVD player I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone else have this issue? It&#39;s really hard to give the film an un-biased review after going through such a hassle to play it. For one, I&#39;ve never seen a Finnish horror film before so I was sort of bummed that the movie was done in English. Also since it&#39;s never made clear what is wrong with Sarah, she just came off as retarded and therefore I really just hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrific happenings go away.

Ayone who whines about how this movie was crap or that it had no plot must have been looking for &#34;Jean de Florrette&#34;. HELLO! this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form. I would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point. This film is clearly made for people who don&#39;t appreciate the so called &#34;american humour&#34; which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap. The point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciative that some peoples sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou

Faqrscape is truly one of those shows that just has it all, great acting,great cast,great writing,sets,chemistry,muppets...it&#39;s got it all and then some, except a home. This fantastic series it&#39;s seem has it all except and ending. TPTB seem to think this is a series that is consecutive single set shows, when anyone who watches know this is an ongoing ,one epic, love story, that has an end that must been seen. If you have never watched Farscape do youself a favor and check it out on DVD when the Season 1 will be released in October....and Season 2 is the best there is! Watch the reruns on the SciFi channel to catch up and then the new season starts in January through March when most shows are going in to hiatis and be sure to watch. If all goes well we will get our ending!

Thank goodness for the Coen Brothers. Their success has brought them bigger budgets,but hasn&#39;t rid them of their creativity. I had planned on seeing another movie, but it was sold out so I went to this one instead. By the time it began, I had forgotten what movie I was there to see. I was surprised in more ways than one. This movie is hilarious, but they don&#39;t make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs. The writing is brilliant, and delivered with great skill by George Clooney (after this, nobody can say he&#39;s just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. It can be appreciated on many levels, whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I can&#39;t remember the last time I saw a movie that was this clever. I&#39;ve seen others I would describe as beautiful, intriguing, funny and charming, all of which also describe &#34;Oh Brother,&#34; but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end. You can feel that their journey is building up to something, but you can&#39;t tell what. And the Coen brothers do not fail us, the end is certainly not disappointing. It&#39;s surprising, and ties up all the loose ends neatly, without wearing the story out.

OK this movie was by far worse then the first one and the first one sucked! The zombie make up was extremely fake! The acting is very poor! And it doesn&#39;t really follow the first one! While watching this I kept thinking wow the first one is a masterpiece compared to this. I would say catch it on TV, Don&#39;t spend your money on it! Its not the worst movie i&#39;ve ever seen but its on the list. I started watching it last night and fell asleep so i watched it today and almost fell asleep again! The plot was pointless, I mean i get the fact that a small military group are sent on a mission to get the blood of the lead zombie and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop zombies but they made it where you wanted everyone to die. They made plenty of bad guys who really were just annoying. If you ask me this was a rip off of resident evil and not a good rip off either. The plot could have made it if the acting was good and if they actually made you feel scared to see whats behind the corner. With these zombies my grandma could have went in that building and survived! out of a 1-10 i give it a 2.

Julie Andrews satirically prods her own goody-two-shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy-drama, but if she approaches her role with aplomb, she&#39;s alone in doing so. Blake Edwards&#39; film about a woman who is both music-hall entertainer and German spy during WWI doesn&#39;t know what tone to aim for, and Rock Hudson has the thankless task of playing romantic second-fiddle. Musicals had grown out of favor by 1970, and elephantine productions like &#34;Star!&#34; and this film really tarnished Andrews&#39; reputation, leaving a lot of dead space in her catalogue until &#34;The Tamarind Seed&#34; came along. I&#39;ve always thought Julie Andrews would&#39;ve made a great villain or shady lady; her strong voice could really command attention, and she hits some low notes that can either be imposing or seductive. Husband/director Edwards seems to realize this, but neither he nor Julie can work up much energy within this scenario. Screenwriter William Peter Blatty isn&#39;t a good partner for Edwards, and neither man has his heart in this material. Beatty&#39;s script offers Andrews just one fabulous sequence--a striptease. *1/2 from ****

I can just picture how this movie came to be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;So how else can we screw up our careers?&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;I know! Let&#39;s take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Perfect! We&#39;ll get B-grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey&#39;s original salary. We&#39;ll save millions and rake in a massive profit, never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place! We as executives still honestly believe a movie was popular based on the name and story, not the actors who made it so in the first place!&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Brilliant! Let&#39;s put a massive budget and get the cheapest actors we can find!&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And really, that&#39;s what Son Of The Mask can be described as. Just a simple B-grade movie that attempts to suck the life out of it&#39;s original classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, if the movie didn&#39;t contain the words the mask, or anything to do with the mask, it would be a nice kids movie. For all it&#39;s massive flaws and horrible acting, this really will appeal to kids. It&#39;s a good natured flick that really wants to scream out &#34;like me!&#34; but only those 8 and younger will truly enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie Kennedy is the only worthwhile mention in this movie. He clearly is trying to make the material work, playing the desperate dad but the script is so poor, the only thing that spews out that is worthwhile was my drink after seeing this. The character of Loki also deserves a mention, as he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this film. It&#39;s too bad the character is wasted on this film, I would have really liked to have seen the character take on the true mask. Instead, we are reduced to fart jokes and toilet humor near the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is so much by the books, I won&#39;t bother to mention it here. It&#39;s all so clearly obvious that even a Disney exec would be green with envy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, this one is heading to DVD in three months from the looks of it. Shame on the studios for once again smearing a decent film with a horrible sequel. Didn&#39;t dumb and dumberer teach them anything?

This is a poem on film, wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry. It captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly. (Italy&#39;s lake district in the twenties.) It&#39;s a love story with a twist. The characters are unique and believable. The settings are deliciously exotic. Some of the scenes --- the funeral boat in the fog --- the high long shot of the chess table in the centre of an intricately patterned tile floor --- are beautiful images. And rather than the mandatory happy ending, this story has a bitter sweet one. If film is an art, this is close to a masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I haven&#39;t always been a fan, but the show grew on me. It wasn&#39;t until after season 5 that I started to see the richness of the show. They finally brought Daniel Jackson&#39;s search for his wife to an end and finally most of the Go,ould System Lords were killed by rival Lords, SG-1 or others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Towards Season 5, Stargate SG-1, was beginning to become stale. With the new writers and the close attention by Produer Peter Deleuise, the show became more and more solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters had become stale as well. Colonel Jack O&#39;Neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage. After his son Charlie was killed in a shooting accident with O&#39;Neill&#39;s weapon, he had decided to end his own life by going to Abydos in order to face off with the Go&#39;ould RA. The character offers little growth for any actor and actor Richard Dean Anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself. only allowing his close friends in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Tapping joined the cast as Captain Samantha Carter. She was a feminist on the edge, ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job. Though this character had little area to grow, Tapping has done a great job of concentrating on Carter&#39;s strengths. She has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things Carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher Judge joined the cast playing the alien Teal&#39;c. Teal&#39;c was an alien called the Jaffa. Infant Go&#39;ould, (snake like creatures) would embed themselves into the Jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form. The Jaffa would die. Teal&#39;c was the First Prime of Apophis&#39; army. Knowing that Apophis was not a god like Go&#39;ould pretend, he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy. Finally, having had enough, he and Jack O&#39;Neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people. After arriving on Earth, he realized that Earth was the planet he was looking for, who would help him fight the Go&#39;ould. Christopher Judge has done quite a bit with a limited character. Teal&#39;c is a wise warrior, much of which he learned was from his teacher Master Bra&#39;tac. The show would not be complete without Master Bra&#39;tac played by Tony Amandola. He is also a rock. In the end, he became adviser to most of SG-1, especially Daniel Jackson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don S. Davil was there from the beginning playing Major General George Hammand. Davis has done an incredible job with Hammond making him sympathetic and normal. He does his job, has a wife, sons and daughters and grandchildren. You can really say, he is the anchor of the base. Simply, I would die for that man. If not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world. He will go himself. He doesn&#39;t leave anyone behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saved Dr. Daniel Jackson for last, because this character, I believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on. In choosing Shanks I don&#39;t think the producer realized how strong Shanks would be and now when people talk about Jackson, they don&#39;t talk about Spader, they talk about Shanks. In the early years, the Jackson character came off as a whiner. That&#39;s why I probably wasn&#39;t a fan. As the seasons pasted, the character became stronger. This gave him confidence. In the end, as of season 10, the Jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero. He still monitors the groups ethics. He still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward. Acheaology, History, Culture and Exploration are part of his very being. He is determined. Though a man of peace, he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other characters include, most recently: Vala Mal Doran(Claudia Black) and Colonel Cameron Mitchell(Ben Browder), new lead of SG-1. Both actors come from a series called Farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess. I see little difference between Mitchell and Crichton (Farscape character). Black&#39;s character is simply off the wall. Definitely different from her soldier like character Arin Soon.

This series was just like what you would expect from Mr.Spielberg. It is truly one of those frighting, funny, childish shows that you won&#39;t forget. Just like Outer Limits (another great show) this little series does what not a lot can. It was great, and deserved to run longer. It was a great show, that even kids could watch, though some of the shows were a little scary when they wanted to be, but all of them always had a moral at the end (like the Twilight Zone) that made you realize what situation you didn&#39;t want to end up in, or ones that you did. I remember watching some of these on Sci-fi when I was 10, and even now, I still enjoy seeing them when I can. Truly a fun, imaginative show. I loved it, and still do.

Ru Paul plays a secret agent called Starrbooty. She teams up with another drag queen agent to fight the evil Annaka Manners (Candis Cayne)and get her kidnapped niece back...or something like that. Seriously-- I had trouble concentrating on the plot! The movie is seemingly directed by somebody with severe ADD--quick camera cuts nonstop that make it impossible to focus on anything. The dialogue is incomprehensible at times and when you can hear it you wish it remained incomprehensible! The acting is actually pretty OK except for Ru Paul who overacts to an embarrassing degree. Also the film is full of disgusting bathroom humor that is just revolting and not even remotely funny. After 30 minutes I had to leave because I was bored, sick and just couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. I pride myself on sitting through anything but this went WAY beyond my limits! People are comparing this to the early work of John Waters. I disagree. Waters&#39; work is sick but good--this is just sick. Avoid.

This movie was very disappointing, and except for a few moments, wasn&#39;t fly at all. More than anything, it was just flippin&#39; stupid. The music was frickin&#39; bad and the plot played out like a BYU bowl game  very predictable (avoiding embarrassment by scoring, a late game flurry of touchdowns, a rally that falls short and leads to a loss). In essence, the half-childish / half-naive Will (the movie&#39;s fetcher) and his religiously confused brother Danny (we&#39;ll just call him a democrat), treat Kirby (the movie&#39;s &#34;Sweet Spirit&#34;), the 3rd member of their hapless Mormon &#34;boy band,&#34; like crap until the man and father figure of the film (the stage manager, Jill) has a talk with Will and straightens him out. Believably, Will&#39;s personality changes 180 degrees and he&#39;s instantly the mature and self-aware leader of the band. This would be a cute, perhaps funny, 10 minute roadshow gig, but the fact that the movie is 93 minutes long really sucks the life out of you if you watch it to the end. My advise  take the money you&#39;d normally spend to rent this show and either burn it in your fireplace or flush it down the toilet  more entertainment with much less time commitment. If you want to watch a better movie of the same genre, get Saints and Soldiers  not a comedy but an infinitely better show (actually, Kirby has more funny stuff in Saints than he does in SOP).

This film is just as bad as &#34;The Birdman of Alcatraz&#34;. I do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films, which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. Moreover it disturbs me when well respected, revered actors like Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play such roles, because their status tends to lend credibility to the director&#39;s intent to elevate the film&#39;s subject, a societal outcast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in junior high school during the last years of Caryl Chessman&#39;s life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news. I remember the groundswell of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and Chessman was the victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a grip people. Read the history. Chessman was a criminal and sexual predator. He drove around the LA streets at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle. He stopped cars with attractive women inside under the ruse of making a traffic arrest; then abducted and raped the women. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to its horror and humiliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chessman got exactly what he deserved, it just took a decade too long. No sympathy for the devil here.

I purchased a DVD of this film for a dollar at the big dept store. That&#39;s probably the best and kindest comment I have to offer on it. At least it didn&#39;t cheat me out of the cost of lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with &#34;Chiller&#34; is Craven&#39;s problem as a director. The man has his apologists who claim his traveling papers prove he&#39;s a really smart guy and all-around sharp conceptualist. But it&#39;s no secret that, as a director, he has never possessed one iota of the visual and story-telling sense of a Hitchcock. As vigorously attested by &#34;Chiller&#34;, he&#39;s much closer to that legendary flat-foot Hershel Gordon Lewis. What Craven lacks as a director is the main ingredient that would lift him from director for hire to a higher plane of film- making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s be specific. The transitional moments of this film are sleek. The establishing shots give it the feel of a quality production. The film looks professionally put together, in the way a film shot by a TV commercial director would. (A thought: The films only visual distinction, these transitions that at least look professionally handled may very well be the work of some second unit directors.) It&#39;s the parts between the bridges and smooth transitions -- the drama -- that fall flat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The core of the proceedings are invariably perfunctorily handled. The critical shots (after, say, the departing car drives into the well-positioned camera, then we cut to the night exterior of a hospital, then to the waiting area and hallway, then to the phone booth in the corner that will figure in the next bit of action) are quickly dispensed so we can hurry up and get to the next part. Craven never comes anywhere close to exploding the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment. The net result of all this misplaced attention to the least important parts, and the fumbling rush to keep things moving, is a film that feels like the work of the fledgling art student who sharpens all his pencils, fussily adjusts his easel and lighting set-up, grinds all his pigments, stretches and primes his canvas ...and then has nothing to say. Craven, like the art student, never gets to the meat of the exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Craven apologists who will point out that this film was made for TV, I will point to Spielberg&#39;s &#34;Duel&#34; and say no more.

On the surface, this is an above-average post-war romantic comedy. Beneath the veneer, it is MGM character actor stunt-casting at its funniest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leads are straightforward, but all the secondaries are cast much against type. Margaret Hamilton (aka Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (professional obsessive-compulsive fussbudget), and Sig Ruman (the Marx Brothers&#39; nemesis in _Night In Casablanca_ and the always-wonderful _Night At The Opera_), playing a well-intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together, instead of driving them apart as their &#34;usual&#34; characters would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also pokes fun at many romantic-comedy conventions, which is another indication that this could be not so much a &#34;straight&#34; romantic comedy, as it is a wry send-up of the many post-war romantic comedies &amp; their 2-dimensional, stock characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve seen it only once, with interruptions, so I can&#39;t be positive, but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made, but is less successful now that viewers &#34;see&#34; these secondary characters through a completely different lens. I&#39;m assuming this is the case when I give it 9 stars. I thought it was hysterical.

A movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot. The film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actor&#39;s innermost feeling. Max, who has lived in New York for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there, comes back to Paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend. Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well. The three women Max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations. His fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see. She gives him also no love but only stability. True love also cannot be found in his relation with the ex-girlfriend. Merely a fantasy for him to escape - many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable. The one who really animates Max&#39;s life in fact is her best friend. The equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because Max has understand much more about his innermost feeling. The nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated. Not equally ingenious as &#34;Pulp Fiction&#34; but things seem much more natural in &#34;The Apartment&#34;. Max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to Romane Bohringer. The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful. A good commentary of today&#39;s love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Menagerie parts one and two was the only 2-parter during the 3-year run of the original Trek series and it was because Roddenberry was able to insert most of the footage from the 1st pilot &#34;The Cage.&#34; The move was made out of necessity, to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced (such a sf show back in the 1960s was a hassle to get done on time). One positive outcome back then was that audiences, unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier, were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters, as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a TV epic spanning a dozen years of Starfleet history (though they still used terms such as &#39;United Space Fleet&#39; in these early episodes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wraparound story begins as a space mystery plot: the Enterprise is diverted to Starbase 11 for unknown reasons and very soon Spock is a suspect in these shenanigans. Astonishingly, though even McCoy belabors the fact that Spock&#39;s Vulcan heritage makes subterfuge on his part impossible, it does turn out that Spock is indeed acting out some mutinous scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain, Pike, now horribly crippled. Well, Spock is half human, we tend to forget. Or has he simply gone mad? It may very well be, for he&#39;s directing Enterprise to Talos IV, a planet so off-limits it&#39;s the subject of the only known death penalty on Starfleet&#39;s books. When the jig is up, there&#39;s a great scene of Spock surrendering to a flabbergasted McCoy, as Uhura looks on in shock. Even Kirk, usually steady as a captain should be, doesn&#39;t know what to make of his first officer&#39;s illogical conduct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 3rd and final acts, we begin to see transmitted images of a mission of the Enterprise from 13 years prior, when Capt. Pike was commanding and Spock was one of his officers. We really don&#39;t know where all this is going and what Spock hopes to accomplish - and that&#39;s another thing that makes this a very good 2-parter - we really need to find out what it&#39;s all about in the 2nd part. Not only is Spock facing severe penalties, but it looks like Kirk&#39;s career may be finished, as well. Double jeopardy, folks. This is also the 1st televised episode to feature one of those shuttlecrafts (none were available in the earlier &#34;The Enemy Within&#34; when the crafts were really needed). There&#39;s also one of those neat matte paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic starbase - this was the only way to visualize such things back then. Finally, check out Kirk&#39;s smug approach at the start of the episode - boy, do things go sideways on him as the story progresses.

you have a strong stomach. Holden was actually 55 years old at filming but looked near 70 and he only lived another 8 years. At one point Holden said, &#34;I am over twice your age.&#34; Okay, try triple grandpa! The &#34;old enough to be your father&#34; theme they were shooting for didn&#39;t work. Granted senior citizens sometimes wind up with legal teens. More power to them, but that doesn&#39;t mean I want to watch it. It&#39;s not a matter of judgment but the digestive track. I like my food where it belongs. Lenz is fun to watch and the 70s cars, clothes, furniture, etc. make it worth it if it comes on cable late at night and you want to watch something to wind down for bed. It would have been nice to see the blonde friend of Lenz, the one who hocked her guitar, get more scenes. Pleasingly spacey... Who was this chick? I&#39;m going to try and find out.

This is a family film, which to some people is an automatic turn off. It seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs, gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the New York phone book. This film is none of those. It is cliché, it is formula, but it is also fun. It doesn&#39;t ask you to think, it doesn&#39;t demand that you accept the film as reality. It simply does what a good film ought to do, which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure. The cast is good, while not excellent. As another commenter pointed out the John Williams sound score was, as usual, excellent. And the fact that a lot of the film was shot in Huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster, which may have played a large part in it&#39;s original theatrical opening, but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie therein. SO sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy.

This is a great, dark, offbeat little film, a modern day adaptation of the quest for the Holy Grail myth. It&#39;s a sleeper if there ever was one. I saw it on cable some years ago and taped it. I&#39;ve loaned it to many of my friends and everyone loved it.

So I turned on the TV today at 1:00 PM on a Sunday, expecting to see crap and infomercials, and this great movie was just starting, didn&#39;t know what it was but drew me in almost immediately. The movie was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there were a couple of things that didn&#39;t make sense for one I don&#39;t get why the dead guy was talking about doing stuff to get yourself out of your bad situation, but then Jimmy doesn&#39;t really do anything except the basic stuff to survive that anyone would do in his situation, in other words it wasn&#39;t his initiative that got him out of his bad situation it was just luck, second I don&#39;t get the thing about the girl killing the the gangsters at the end, because the whole thing was partly casued by the thief people stealing Panda&#39;s money, and then the other thief kills Panda at the end, so they steal his money twice, and kill him how is that good?

It actually pains me to say it, but this movie was horrible on every level. The blame does not lie entirely with Van Damme as you can see he tried his best, but let&#39;s face it, he&#39;s almost fifty, how much more can you ask of him? I find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together Undisputed 2; arguably the best (western) martial arts movie in years, created this. Everything from the plot, to the dialog, to the editing, to the overall acting was just horribly put together and in many cases outright boring and nonsensical. Scott Adkins who&#39;s fight scenes seemed more like a demo reel, was also terribly underused and not even the main villain which is such a shame because 1) He is more than capable of playing that role and 2) The actual main villain was not only not intimidating at all but also quite annoying. Again, not blaming Van Damme. I will always be a fan, but avoid this one.

This movie is like the thousand &#34;cat and mouse&#34; movies that preceded it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but it really just describes a large class of movies) There is the passionate, wise main character, his goofy but well-meaning sidekick with his ill-placed attempts at humorous comments, the initially-hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable &#34;unlikely&#34; love story, the loved ones taken hostage, and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions. Everybody has seen tons of these movies already, and &#34;National Treasure&#34; is like any one of them, with only a slightly modified wrapping. Every turn of the story was easily predicted (and I can assure you I am not the sharpest tool in the shed). I am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a Hollywood movie, and if you have ever felt that way too, heed my warning; stay miles away from this movie.

What an embarassment...This doesnt do justice to the original with awful acting from everyone in this movie, Hitchcock must be spinning in his grave. The scence where Marion gets killed in the shower is just so uneffective and unoriginal. The only good bit is that they used the same music and its so obvious who kills her in the shower. I rate this movie 3/10

There&#39;s no denying the first Azumi film was a commercial product; it was an adaptation of a popular manga and had cast of young, attractive actors and certainly wasn&#39;t lacking in the budget department. Yet it more than entertained for what it was, and I can&#39;t deny I enjoyed it immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Azumi 2&#34; lacks just about everything that made the original so wonderful. The first thing that should set alarm bells ringing is the absence of the superb Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm. With him, he seemed to take not only his own visual flair and kinetics, but the originals style, beauty and most importantly, its heart. While the first had a simple &#34;hitlist&#34; plot, this one has a corkscrew mess of a story, with too many dull characters stabbing each other in the back so many times the potential for any sympathy or pathos is obliterated. Gone is the effective interplay between the lead characters; Azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a bunch of stroppy teenagers arguing in a forest. Characterisation is non existent; if anyone watching actually cares who lives and who dies, I&#39;ll be shocked. The same applies to the villains here. The final battle - in fact all the battles - are completely devoid of any sort of tension. The fact that they are poorly choreographed and abysmally directed - not to mention few and far between - is made a sideline by their own sheer pointlessness. The villains themselves try far too hard to be campy, and even if they were all combined, they don&#39;t come within a country mile of the Pete Burnsian antics of Jo Odagiri in the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;####Major Spoiler at end of paragraph!##### &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aya Ueto tries her best it has to be said, and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films. Azumi is now a fully fledged assassin, meaning she can wave her sword around in slow motion; unfortunately, now the character is instilled with a sort of Man With No Name style mysteriousness, Ueto&#39;s model looks become even more inappropriate. I know this is supposed to be the point, but this combined with the ineffectiveness of everyone else in the film, the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptness of the film in general means it is downright impossible to get behind her character this time around. The less said about Chiaki &#34;Remember me from Kill Bill&#34; Kuriyama&#39;s performance the better; it suffices to say her &#34;turn&#34; from good to evil is about as subtle as napalm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was just a colossal disappointment. Any merits is does have were done ten times better in the first film. A lazy, unsatisfying - and generally downright boring - mess.

While Hollywood got sort of stagnant during the few years after WWII, England developed a very prolific film industry. In &#34;The Man in the White Suit&#34;, inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a suit that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that certain other businesses are now likely to go out of business! How can Sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity? This is an example of one of the great movies in which Alec Guinness starred before he became Obi Wan Kenobi. It&#39;s a good look at the overall absurdity of the business world. If you&#39;re planning to start any kind of business, you might want to consider watching this movie.

David Cronenberg movies are easily identifiable, or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks. Fetishism, the blurring between the organic and inorganic, squishy throbbing things that shouldn&#39;t be squishy and throbbing. &#34;eXistenZ&#34; is classic Cronenberg. Briefly, it&#39;s about a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, visuals are supplied by your mind. The game plugs directly into a &#39;bio port&#39; in the base of your spine and while the game is running, the player can&#39;t tell reality from game. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the game&#39;s developer, guiding a novitiate marketeer, Jude Law, through the game&#39;s paces. While in the game they uncover strange goings-on and possible crimes. But are they real, or is it the game? Not even the game&#39;s author knows. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is quite a treat, keeping the viewer engaged, but in the dark until the final minutes. Another thing I like about &#34;eXistenZ&#34; is that it doesn&#39;t use a heavy reliance on special effects, it&#39;s the story itself that propels the movie. Recommended for the Saturday night when science fiction is called for.

It&#39;s really just terrible. Quaid overacts more than Shatner. The part where Elvis walks in and says &#34;You can have it all&#34; just kills anything that might have been good in this movie that&#39;s bad enough as it is. Drug use was completely snow coated, the only thing that had anything to do with his life was the bit about him wedding his cousin. Quaid also looks nothing like Lewis and has dark roots and eyebrows. I wish this could be re-made in the future with someone who doesn&#39;t try so hard. A bigger budget wouldn&#39;t hurt and maybe more about his actual life. I was very, very disappointed in Quaid. Don&#39;t watch this movie or you will be too.

In Bridgeport, the deranged high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed by the teenager student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, the traumatized Donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills. On her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples of friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for the party. But the psychopath Richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing Donna, stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The forgettable slash &#34;Prom Night&#34; is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality. The stupid story is shallow and silly, with a bad acting of Johnathon Schaech in the role of an insane killer. The predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes. My vote is three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;A Morte Convida Para Dançar&#34; (&#34;The Death Invites to Dance&#34;)

Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who evidently is trying his hand at directing. &#34;A Walk on the Moon&#34; appears to have borrowed from other, better made films. The present story takes place in the late sixties at a summer resort for working class Jews not far from Woodstock. The screen treatment by Pamela Gray doesn&#39;t have much going for it, so it&#39;s a puzzle why Mr. Goldwyn decided to tackle this film as his first attempt at direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kantrowitz family is spending some time at the resort. We see them arrive at the small bungalow that is going to be their temporary home. Marty, the father, comes only for the week-end; he works in what appears to be a family small appliance business repairing television sets, mostly. In a few days the first man will walk in space, so the excitement is evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kantrowitz women are left behind. Pearl, Marty&#39;s wife and her mother-in-law, Lilian, spend idle days in the place until the &#34;blouse salesman&#34; arrives. Pearl goes browsing and she finds much more than a shmatte; she gets the salesman as well. It appears that Pearl and Marty have no sexual life at all. After two children, Pearl, who appears to be sexy and with a high libido is ready for some extra marital fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the basic premise for the film, which becomes a soap opera when the young daughter, Alison, decides to play hooky and go to the Woodstock festival nearby where, horror of horrors, she witnesses her own mom making out with the blouse salesman! What&#39;s a girl to do? Well, stay tuned for the grand finale when all the parties are happily reunited by the little son&#39;s bedside when he is stung by wasps and the salesman comes to apply some home remedy, and daddy is called from the city, after knowing about Pearl&#39;s betrayal with the younger stud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor Diane Lane, she went to make &#34;Unfaithful&#34; later on, which is the upscale version of this dud. Viggo Mortensen is the salesman who caters to his lonely female customers whispering little somethings in their ears! Liev Schreiber as Marty, the cuckolded husband, doesn&#39;t have much to do. Anna Paquin plays the rebellious Alison and Tovah Feldshuh is the unhappy Nana, who would like to have stayed in the city watching her soap operas instead of witnessing first hand one that is playing in her own backyard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch it at your risk, or pop the DVD in the telly when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want to have a laugh, or two dishing the film.

A Jane Smiley novel, loosely based on Shakespeare&#39;s KING LEAR about the Cook family and its dark secrets. Director Moorhouse seems tamed in her approach, allowing the characters to step forward and take a bow. And how could you go wrong with the talents of Pfeiffer, Lange, Leigh, Firth, Carradine and Robards?

&#34;CASOMAI&#34; was the last movie I&#39;ve seen before getting married, just last year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was also the first movie I&#39;ve searched for, after I was married, because we promised to offer a copy to our priest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, reality is not that apart from fiction. To all those who wrote that priests like &#34;Don Camillo&#34; don&#39;t exist in real life, I would recommend them to visit my Priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all others, I would only recommend them to see this movie, before and after the &#34;I do!&#34; day :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal

&#34;Baby Face&#34; is a precode melodrama starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck, an almost unrecognizable George Brent, and Theresa Harris. It&#39;s about a girl who goes to the city to make good...or should I say make time. Stanwyck&#39;s father has been pimping her for one reason or another her whole life in dingy, depressed, filthy Erie, Pennsylvania. After her father dies, one older father type who knows what she&#39;s been through and truly cares about her future advises her to go to the big city and take advantage of opportunities there - and not the easy ones - and to take the high road in life. (Note that I saw the censored version and not the uncut - this part of the film was redone for the censors.) She and Chico (Harris) go to New York where Lily (nickname: Baby Face) decides the low road&#39;s a lot smoother and will get her where she wants to go a lot faster. In the movie&#39;s most famous scene, the camera moves us up the corporate ladder by taking us from floor to floor as Lily sleeps her way to the top. She finally corrals the big man himself and is able to quit her day job. Trouble follows, and she&#39;s soon involved in a huge scandal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stanwyck wears lots of makeup and for most of the film is cool as a cucumber as she seduces one man after another with no regrets, and she&#39;s great at playing the innocent victim. In one scene, she sits staring at a king&#39;s ransom in jewels while wearing a black dress that looks like it&#39;s decorated with diamonds at the top. Then she asks Chico for another case, and that&#39;s filled with more jewelry, plus securities. All in a day&#39;s work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theresa Harris was an interesting talent - she could be played down or glamorous, and was a talented singer and dancer as well. Here, she sings or hums the movie&#39;s theme, &#34;St. Louis Woman&#34; throughout. She worked in literally dozens of movies and is very good here as a friend of Stanwyck&#39;s, her best work being in the precode era. As a bizarre byproduct of the code, blacks were often given less to do in films after it was put in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precode films could be more sexually blatant and therefore, though they&#39;re 70+ years old, seem more modern. Even though these films didn&#39;t have to have moral endings, Baby Face learns her lessons - how like life it is after all. There were several endings of this film, all with the same message. The one I saw had an added scene, but apparently, there were two other endings that didn&#39;t pass the censors. (There wasn&#39;t a code but there were always censors.) At any rate, it&#39;s a neat surprise. &#34;Baby Face&#34; is an important film in movie history - a must see.

For a Norris movie this is pretty tame. For an action movie it is kind of dull, and as far as predictability goes my friend and I almost had every turn of this movie nailed. It was nice that the killer&#39;s every moves were not telegraphed by the cliche&#39;s of 80&#39;s action movies, but come on, the only non-predictable move defies the plot and the set-up of the editing. Mainly, it is said rather early on that the killer (Jack O&#39;Halloran, whom is one of the few slightly known actors) only kills women. YET, he all of a sudden stops his M.O. and kills men, huh?. I guess it can be construed and rationalized some way, but why is the movie edited to show that he is going to kill women?? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet again, I&#39;m sure that there is a reason (i.e. to build suspense), but why spend the time watching it when many other suspense movies are vastly superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of &#34;Renegade&#34; may enjoy the small cameo by Branscombe Richmond as Victor, but his brief appearence cannot save the movie and even a vote of 4 seems generous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

GREAT MOVIE! Chucky is by far the funniest character in a movie. Jennifer Tilly (Tiffany) makes this movie even better! Well before Chucky died Tiffany and him were together. But like ten years later Tiffany gets Chucky back (as a doll) and brings him back to life. It was a great movie!Scary and definetly funny (only because Chucky!)10/10

Dull, cheap sci-fi thriller, made with an almost total lack of conviction (a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is run by only ONE MAN, and is VERY poorly guarded at night), and full of campy sound effects. Christopher Lee is not only wasted, but he also gives one of his few &#34;I&#39;m here strictly for the money&#34; performances. (*1/2)

This is a quite slow paced movie, slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger. The viewer slowly feels that there&#39;s something wrong here ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really loved this movie even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end. It is clever, well paced and very well acted. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deeply into their characters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little son &#34;pierrot&#34; is also very touching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thriller which does not seem like one. A very unconventional movie, very particular atmosphere throughout the whole movie though you might feel awkward a few times with a couple of scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#39;ll give it a 8/10 !!

Sleeper Cell attempts to swim both sides of the pool (terrorism/patriotic Muslim Americans), and it does neither very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had put off watching this show for a very long time, because I had a feeling it would be too predictable, but after a year in my netflix queue, I finally moved it up to the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show is about an undercover Muslim man working for the FBI in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the United States. The undercover agent in the show actually is a Muslim, so we see his conflict/resolution between his Patriotism and his Religious beliefs. Personally I would have rather watched a drama about a Muslin American family living in the United States, but it is doubtful that an America TV channel (cable or network) will ever produce anything that shows Muslims in a flattering light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a Muslim, but I have a lot of Muslim American Friends, and I can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and they all love America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleeper Cell comes close to busting stereotypes of Muslims, but it also focuses on the worse Muslim stereotypes. In the first episode we see an &#34;honor killing,&#34; which is a very poor portrayal of Islam, but in the 3rd episode we see a very respected moderate Muslim scholar teaching the viewer that the real Jihad is actually a personal struggle that is not meant to incite violence towards others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only the Moderate Muslim scholar had been the main character of the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Americans need to learn a lot more about Islam, Sleeper Cell helps a little bit, but it comes up far short of giving the America audience what it really needs to knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the acting in this show is superb, and the drama is extremely engrossing. If only they had made this show about Islam in America without the terrorism, it would have been first rate.

I only watched this because it starred Josie Lawrence, who I knew&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from Whose Line is it Anyway?, the wacky British improvisational&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;comedy show. I was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem. It is uplifting, touching, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;romantic without being sappy or sentimental. The characters are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all real people, with real foibles, fears and needs. See it.!

It&#39;s not fair. I was really expecting this to be a hilarious, entertaining movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell from Drake and Josh, and Leslie Neilson is nothing to be sneezed at since his earliest classics, Airplane and the Naked Gun. However, After seeing Superhero movie, I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t even have to pay for it. It just wouldn&#39;t have been anywhere near the 9$ per ticket. More like a dollar and a few pennies. Because that would sum up for the hour and a few minutes. And as disappointing as this film was I&#39;m glad the running time was that short, if not shorter. I just cant believe how incredibly vulgar, unnecessary, and above all, STUPID, some of the scenes were! And above that, I&#39;ve seen better acting from a wooden dummy(without the ventriloquist). It&#39;s as if Craig Mazin purposefully wanted to make a film that deserves its 3.7, if not lower, and even try to be worse than &#34;Meet the Spartans&#34;. Very disappointing indeed.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best mock documentary of a dog show that I have seen in a long time. A very long time. Well lets face it,ever. Isn&#39;t that part of the charm ? The idea of actually going to the trouble to make a movie mocking a documentary about an event that most people would find odd in the first place. Even if there were no big laughs, one would still be smirking at the thought. Any movie that attempts something new scores highly in my proverbial book. I loved the dogs too !

He really lost the plot with this one! None of his distinctive trademarks here at all, an uninteresting plot and completely terrible acting make this his worst film (in my opinion). Even his trademark gore is gone, bar one scene in an operating theatre. Oh well, at least his next film &#39;Nightmare Concert&#39; showed that he could still shock when he wanted to...

Not being a fan of the Coen Brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see the skepticism I took into the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something different. This time it was those zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) Coens doing &#34;their thing&#34; to one of the great works in literary history. Who would&#39;ve ever thought Homer had this in mind? I don&#39;t know where this film is going to fit in the history books of Hollywood, but it will be in both mine and many others DVD or VHS library. It is one of those films that you can watch over and over. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and entertaining, with a couple of Gumpesque brushes with fame, great performances by Clooney, Turturro, Nelson, and a brief but hilarious Holly Hunter. Being born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the south, I wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this. They even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south. You are NOT doing anything better this weekend, go see this movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

As a &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; fan I was excited when this movie came out. &#34;At last,&#34; I thought, &#34;someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author.&#34; Wrong!!! If the casting director was intending to cast a &#34;Jane&#34; who was plain he certainly succeeded. However, surely he could have found one who could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere? Where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother? Finally, why was the plot changed at the end? One wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book. What a disappointment

OK, why complain about this movie? It&#39;s fiction. Deal with it. If you want to see the biography, go watch it. This is an original, fictionalized version of what happened in Wisconsin. People who are obsessed will complain about this, as they do every other deviation of the facts. Sad but true. I think making Kane Hodder the man in which the film is named after was a great idea. I thought it wasn&#39;t so good at first, I&#39;ll be honest. But that just made it even scarier. If you like Kane Hodder, Ed Gein or movies based on real events, I think this is a good movie. But if you&#39;re obsessed (like some other people) stay away from this movie and all others.

The chupacabra, according to this mockumentary, is a mysterious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;creature that has been killing and eating Hispanic goats in Latin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;America and Mexico for years. One has crossed the border into&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;southern Texas, and a cute, intrepid cryptozoologist (no, I did not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;make up that word) go to an isolated ranch to find one. Her uncle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was killed by the creature, and some grainy video footage of the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;monster exists. She takes a badass black guy with a gun and two&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cameramen (for easy-to-edit coverage), and they go ahuntin&#39; for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;chupacabras. Ten minutes into the film, they find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the film has the team of documentarians getting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;attacked by the bloodthirsty monster, and stilted dialogue. At one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;point, the team runs into a couple of hottie witches who lead them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to the chupacabra&#39;s nest...for $100. If only the FBI knew about how&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cheaply Tex-Mex witches could be bought as informants. Whole&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;decades of mythical beast reports could be cleared up with a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;blank check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, after the bloody deaths of characters you don&#39;t give a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;goat&#39;s patoot about, a chupacabra is captured, killed, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;autopsied. The only point of the autopsy scene is to highlight the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;makeup department&#39;s efforts in such a cheap film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is shot on video, just like &#34;BWP,&#34; yet the cameraman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;characters never reload their tapes or recharge their camera&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;batteries. The lead actress here is awful. The beauty of the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;average &#34;BWP&#34; was its use of improvisation during the production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, all the lines are written, and are delivered like a poorly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rehearsed Christmas pageant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is tinged with racism, as well. The only African-American&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here is a loudmouthed gun nut. At one point, as the crew breaks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;into an abandoned house, they find a trio of illegal immigrants who&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;comically ask them if they are from the INS. Chortle, chortle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit, and nothing more. For&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;such a lumbering and awkward beast, he is able to sneak up on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cast pretty quietly, whether they have idiotically locked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;themselves in a giant cage as bait, or cannot seem to get their&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only vehicle started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gore is gruesome, but when surrounded by this kind of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stupidity, it loses all of its effectiveness. I do not know if this was&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shot before or after &#34;BWP,&#34; but I can honestly say this is the worst&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;film ever made in southern Texas about a mythical beast. Pray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are not any sequels, I will start a letter writing campaign to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Troma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gun violence, strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gore, and profanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Jeopardy is a tense, satisying thriller, a cut above a B but not really a major production. It qualifies as almost an experimental film, as the studio that produced it, Metro, was desperately looking for new kinds of films, stars and directors to compete with the then new medium of television. The director, John Sturges, was an up-and-comer whose best years lay ahead. He had just recently begun directing A level films, and had already proved himself a most capable craftsman. Stars Barbara Stanwyck, Barry Sullivan and Ralph Meeker, were at very different phases of their careers. Stanwyck&#39;s glory years were behind her, and yet she could still carry a film, as she proves here. Barry Sullivan, as her husband, was one of a dozen or so leading men who got started in films in the forties who never quite achieved the success many had hoped for him. He was a fine, low-key actor, poised, but in an upper middle rather than upper class way, which made him excellent in professional roles. As the escaped convict who is the only person around who can save Sullivan&#39;s life (he is trapped under a pier, and the tide is rising), Ralph Meeker is more energetic than usual. This excellent actor had the misfortune of having come to films after Brando and Clift. He was in his way as good an actor as either of them, but he lacked charisma. His bargaining with Stanwyck, which comes down to his demanding sex in exchange for saving her husband (by implication only, as this is 1953), makes for an intriguing premise which, had this been a different kind of film, could all raised all sorts of interesting questions about Stanwyck&#39;s character. Meeker is indeed a more exciting character than Sullivan; and in her scenes with him Stanwyck is livelier than she is with her husband and son. But as this is a formula picture, not a Strindberg play, the possibility that Stanwyck might want want to have a fling,--leaving aside the question of her husband&#39;s predicament,--remains unexplored. In this sense the incoming tide doesn&#39;t quite have the effect one might have wished, though the movie remains tense and highly entertaining thanks to excellent acting, fine location photography, nearly all of it outdoors, and excellent direction by the woefully underrated Mr. Sturges.

Mr. Bean has shaped the face of British TV comedy. He has proved that you do not need wicked words or wit, a massive budget, a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters who you just can&#39;t forget. Some of these episodes had me in stitches - yes, they&#39;re not realistic at all and they&#39;re all pretty stupid, but to be honest, realism is one of the barriers Bean has broken on its way to greatness. Rowan Atkinson and co. always manage to cook up interesting new ideas - and hilarious new gags - remember when Mr. Bean drove his green Mini whilst sitting on a sofa on the roof? Mr. Bean is one of those things that never gets weak - the movie wasn&#39;t as good as this, but Bean has introduced a distinct new sense of humour to the world, and kids and adults alike will marvel at its immense fun factor. &#34;Extras&#34; and &#34;Little Britain&#34; can be damned - this is British comedy at its best and most original. These escapades never get old! 10/10

In my opinion, the movie was laughable--bad dialogue. Whoever wrote the script--please keep your day job. It&#39;s definitely NO Godfather or Goodfellas. It&#39;s good to be on the otherside of the table--poor choice of words. Some of the characters were clowns. But what do you expect from a low budget movie with no name actors.

A very carelessly written film. Poor character and idea development. The silly plot and weak acting by just about the ensemble cast didn&#39;t help. Seriously, watching this movie will NOT make you smile. It may make you retch.

Like his earlier film, &#34;In a Glass Cage&#34;, Agustí Villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor. This is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see. The heightened drama, intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical, yet never steps into it. In that way, it pulls off an almost impossible feat: to be so over-the-top and yet so painfully restrained, to be so charged and yet so understated, and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye. Unabashed, gorgeous, and highly tense... this film is simply superb!

Years ago, Sara, a young girl witnessed her parents being murdered, now as an adult she suffers from various mental ailments (did I mention she has an imaginary friend?) This film lulls the viewer, not into a sense of tension, mind you, but rather a sense of sleepiness. Deathly boring, I found it hard to sit through as I could feel my eyelids growing heavier and heavier with each endless minute of mindless prattle and supposed &#39;mystery&#39;. Is Sara going crazy? or is it the paranormal? A better question would be, Who cares? And the answer to that, no one. No one at all. Skip this film, save yourself some time better suited to do other more worthwhile tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: D-

One of John&#39;s Funniest, Eugene Levy is great in this one as well, Just wish the studio would figure out that this one needs to be on DVD, i have it on video tape, but feel that this film deserves DVD (and extras would be great) the Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) skit is so very funny, as is the entire film, also the scenes he has with his girlfriend and her family are great, this movie never seems to be on TV, but it loses most of it&#39;s hilarity when edited for broadcast TV, if you can find the video i would suggest you buy it (ebay is a good place to find a copy) I will keep my VHS until one day we get to see it on DVD. there are so many great movies out there that still have not been released to DVD, and this is one of them.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Human Body --- WoW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are about 27,000 Sunrises in human life....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hardly one thousand Sunrises will be watched by 90% of Humans on this planet....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our days are limited...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent movie for all women.... makers of human body...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and Regards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. Writer/Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on-screen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it&#39;s few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.

I&#39;ve finally seen THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well, it surely wasn&#39;t worth waiting all this time to see it. THE INCUBUS is strictly by-the-number horror film: unseen killer/monster is raping and murdering women in a small town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film goes like this: movie opens with killing; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another killing; even more blah blah blah; continuing with blah blah blah; yet another killing (surprising, huh?); blah blah blah, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is totally predictable from beginning to end. Even the stupid &#34;big&#34; red-herring used throughout the movie wouldn&#39;t convince a 5 year old. And I figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment I saw the character, so when the &#34;shocking&#34; surprise ending arrived, I wasn&#39;t shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I kept on chuckling days after I saw the movie. It&#39;s so silly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the film is so by-the-number that the &#34;rock band&#34; sequence is one of the few stand-out moments in this dreary flick. It&#39;s a stand-out scene not necessarily because it&#39;s good but because it&#39;s so funny and pointless: the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video-like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut, all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater&#39;s washroom by the incubus. The best thing I could say about this film is the cinematography, which I actually liked. But aside from that, there&#39;s almost nothing worth mentioning about THE INCUBUS, except that it&#39;s unintentionally hilarious.

This is, without a doubt, the most hilarious movie I&#39;ve ever seen. Seriously, if the makers of this movie are ever discovered, they&#39;ll put guys like Jim Carrey out of a job. Rent &#34;Jack-O&#34; tonight! Believe me, you won&#39;t regret it!

WARNING!!! TONS OF DEAD GIVEAWAYS!!! DON&#39;T READ IF YOU HAVEN&#39;T SEEN THIS SERIES! OR YOU CAN, WHATEVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#39;re are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another; Liars, Cheats, maybe even some words that can&#39;t be uttered. But When Elm Street 6: Freddy&#39;s Dead shows everyone who thought the series got old, and wanted to stop seeing him, or people who wanted their hero (or Villian) just stops for his final breath, This film was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film starts with a parody of Wizard of Oz, Then you see a kid who is named only as John Doe, Who is the last child in Springwood, Ohio, leaves and gets out of Freddy territory. A woman who resides at a hospital/ place to get kids off their feet kind of place meets this boy, and at the same time, has a dream about a man, a water tower, and a promise of a secret floating in her mind, goes back to Springwood to figure out this frightening vision, and soon finds out that she is Freddy&#39;s child, And we soon find out that Freddy can only leave Springwood if his daughter can be a sort of host for him. And beyond that, fright ensues. This film seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film has tons of humor, and cameo appearences, like Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp, and a very young Breckin Meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees psychadelic vision of flowers and Iron Butterfly&#39;s &#34;In-a-gadda-da-vida&#34;, then gets stuck in a super Mario parody of sorts. This film will either make you hate this movie, or like Krueger even more. The best of the best.

I recently got the chance to view &#34;The Waterdance&#34;, and quite liked it. I don&#39;t really understand why its called that as there isn&#39;t really any dancing going on there, except maybe for the dancing at the strip club near the end. We are introduced to the main characters throughout the movie, invalids in a hospital. The story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story.Unfortunately, you don&#39;t get to see movies like that today. Im not &#34;stuck in a time warp&#34;, im not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today, but I really think the movie industry is deteriorating and there&#39;s much we can learn from old movies-by old movies i mean anything from 1920-1998.

As others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work. And even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new, inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta&#39;s shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the British industry is even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is so bad I wouldn&#39;t even bother renting it from the weeklies section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth.

How amazing this film is! I&#39;ve seen it over and over throughout the years and I&#39;m always spellbound by it. The reason why the film is so easy to re-watch is, of course, the arresting performance given by the young Bette Davis. She not only steals every scene that she&#39;s in, but is actually much prettier and better photographed here (not to mention sexier) than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio, Warner Brothers (this film was made by R.K.O. Radio Pictures). She wears a very flattering make-up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those lovely big eyes (especially, in the restaurant scenes that take place in London&#39;s Soho). Her body was so curvy when she was young. Get a load of it in the cheap negligee that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard. And oh boy, she is an absolute powerhouse in that scene. Howard is a little too nervous throughout, but he does captures the hero&#39;s sensitivity. Frances Dee scores as the sweet, pretty young Sally who truly loves him. Max Steiner&#39;s score is both charming and poignant. Splendid performances and thirties flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel.

A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely well done and Polanski performs well as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers. Horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing. Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic, bearing in mind the storyline. Nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element, but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end. I can&#39;t help feel that there are more than a few of the director&#39;s own feelings of not being a &#39;real&#39; Frenchman and Jewish to boot. Still, there is plenty to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is as reliable as ever.

This show was laughably bad. The writing sucked, the dialog sucked. The guy who played Craig couldn&#39;t act his way out of a paper sack. Being it was on Thursday night, this was definitely great to watch with some beers. Cool music, bad acting, poor writing, all came together for my entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a drama/unintentional comedy. I don&#39;t care what happened to any of the characters, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, since they couldn&#39;t reveal who the victim was, they had to write the dialog around it, which was terrible. I mean, the eulogy at the funeral was ridiculous. Actually, all the scenes that occurred in the present were utterly horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, let&#39;s review. Everything happening in present time sucked. The flashback scenes, only the writing, dialog and Craig&#39;s acting sucked. The music ruled though.

This kind of storytelling is unacceptable The only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because it&#39;s got George Lucas behind it, and it has the words &#34;Star&#34; and &#34;Wars&#34; in its title. That is an insult to aspiring filmmakers, and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story, writing and acting, but did not get the credit. This is a travesty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first. The story. Anakin&#39;s evolution? There is none. Apart from a little make-up around the eyes, and a little yelling, there is none. He becomes young, stupid, cocky Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader in a single blow. The only thing consistent about Darth Vader in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was at almost everything he did, planning, fighting, you name it. The only consistent thing about Anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity. He even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What part of the Emperor Palpatine telling him legends of the Sith does not point to the Emperor being a Sith? Unacceptable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fight scenes used too many digital doubles. Everyone&#39;s flying all over the place like teddy bears in a make-believe doll house. Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one specific fight scene, Obi-Wan and Anakin in the climactic battle, they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes, to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart. I realize the fights are choreographed, but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing was awful. All the dialogue was of tremendously low quality. The good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did the best they could with their lines, but that just wasn&#39;t enough. I can&#39;t say enough bad things about this film. Too much special effects, plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe, and absolutely no insights into any of the characters. This is the biggest mistake of this film: nothing new is offered. We know the rough picture of everything, all Lucas did was colour it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We knew Anakin lost his limbs. We knew Luke and Leia are brother and sister, we knew Luke is Anakin&#39;s son, we knew Obi-Wan and Yoda go to exile, we knew everything. Nothing new is offered in this film. If that&#39;s all the fans wanted, then that&#39;s fine, Lucas couldn&#39;t have gone wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader, and he asks after Padme, and hears she is dead, he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams &#34;Nooooooooooooooooooooo.&#34; That scene screamed B-movie all the way, and I was half expecting Darth Vader to go &#34;DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER&#34; at any time. That is what this is. A B-movie, disguised by a huge budget and a ultra-loyalist fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the pits of the Earth.

I must tell you right up front, I am certainly NOT an authority on Bollywood films and have only seen a handful. However, if you&#39;ve never seen one, DON&#39;T start with this one! I have greatly enjoyed the ones I&#39;ve seen up until this one, but I just couldn&#39;t stand this one. I also must tell you up front that I could not finish this film--it was that annoying. So why was it so annoying? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. There is a character named &#39;Rambha&#39; in the film. He is even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks--which I never would have believed would have been possible. He is so #@^!# annoying!! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think was meant to be comic relief. Instead, he just grated on my nerves and wanted him to die...slowly! His voice, his mannerisms and his obnoxiousness--he just didn&#39;t seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in--and he needed to die! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The heroes had the amazing ability to dodge AK-47 bullets with ease. I kid you not--there was a scene where several unarmed guys took on a small army of guys with these assault rifles!! And, again and again, they avoided taking a single bullet AND beat up the ruffians!!! This made Stallone&#39;s actions in &#34;Rambo II&#34; look mundane!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The film was so gosh-darn loud, in your face and intense--it practically made my brain bleed!! It was as if the film were made by people under the influence of meth!! Crazy camera angles, INTENSE music and action, action, action...this movie is clearly designed for someone who can&#39;t take a movie with plot and wants nearly 100% action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sense...none whatsoever! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps if you are the most ardent action and Bollywood fan you can stand this film, but as for me I can see why it&#39;s on IMDb&#39;s infamous Bottom 100 list. Wow...this film is bad AND intensely bad!!

It&#39;s got Christopher Lee, it&#39;s got huge banks of 1970s computers that make Teletype noises as letters appear on the screen, it&#39;s got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises, it&#39;s got volcanoes! evil aliens disguised as nuns! tidal waves! earthquakes! exploding cars! exploding coffee machines! and as a climax the entire planet blows up. How on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly, mind-numbingly DULL? The answer, my friend is because 90% of this movie is made up of establishing shots, most of them involving long tracks, pans, or zooms in combinations, or occasionally all three, that do nothing except give the crew something to do. There are endless shots of our protagonists driving, getting in and out of cars, driving again, walking around looking at stuff, getting in cars and driving... I just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering &#34;Say something, please somebody, just say something... DO something... anything!...&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialogue, when it does come, is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours.&#34; was a typically meaningless line. The script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage, justified in this speech from Lee as the head alien:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The planet Earth has emitted an over-abundance of diseases, they are contaminating the Universe. All the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed!&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is is Neanderthal SF script writing. This is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950&#39;s Japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds. It is, and I collect such things, the most god-awful line from an English language SF movie since Buster Crabbe retired. It beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee, who always struck me as a smart, useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits, delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek. I don&#39;t blame him.

A complete and utter waster of my precious two hours. The entire movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people getting coked up, a car crashing, people getting more coked up, people having sex, people crying, and people getting more coked up. The tagline for this movie should have read &#34;Come see how f*cked up our characters are! They&#39;re stoned! They&#39;re coke addicts! They&#39;re a mess! Who are these people? Do you really care? Does it matter? Just give us your money please, because we sure don&#39;t care about anything else!&#34; An absolutely terrible movie. It never went anywhere, you never got to know the characters (they never even said what these people did to earn such a big house and so much money and cars and coke), and it was just downright boring. You might like the movie a little more if you&#39;re a stoner yourself, but for the vast majority of us that aren&#39;t, this movie is a waste of film and of time.

This is probably the fastest-paced and most action-packed of the German Edgar Wallace &#34;krimi&#34; series, a cross between the Dr. Mabuse films of yore and 60&#39;s pop thrillers like Batman and the Man from UNCLE. It reintroduces the outrageous villain from an earlier film who dons a stylish monk&#39;s habit and breaks the necks of victims with the curl of a deadly whip. Set at a posh girls&#39; school filled with lecherous middle-aged professors, and with the cops fondling their hot-to-trot secretaries at every opportunity, it certainly is a throwback to those wonderfully politically-incorrect times. There&#39;s a definite link to a later Wallace-based film, the excellent giallo &#34;Whatever Happened to Solange?&#34;, which also concerns female students being corrupted by (and corrupting?) their elders. Quite appropriate to the monk theme, the master-mind villain uses booby-trapped bibles here to deal some of the death blows, and also maintains a reptile-replete dungeon to amuse his captive audiences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alfred Vohrer was always the most playful and visually flamboyant of the series directors, and here the lurid colour cinematography is the real star of the show. The Monk appears in a raving scarlet cowl and robe, tastefully setting off the lustrous white whip, while appearing against purplish-night backgrounds. There&#39;s also a voyeur-friendly turquoise swimming pool which looks great both as a glowing milieu for the nubile students and as a shadowy backdrop for one of the murder scenes. The trademark &#34;kicker&#34; of hiding the &#34;Ende&#34; card somewhere in the set of the last scene is also quite memorable here. And there&#39;s a fine brassy and twangy score for retro-music fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of the series will definitely miss the flippant Eddie Arent character in these later films. Instead, the chief inspector Sir John takes on the role of buffoon, convinced that he has mastered criminal psychology after taking a few night courses. Unfortunately, Klaus Kinski had also gone on to bigger and better things. The krimis had lost some of their offbeat subversive charm by this point, and now worked on a much more blatant pop-culture level, which will make this one quite accessible to uninitiated viewers.

I had no expectations (never saw previews for &#34;Marigold&#34;) and enjoyed the characters, contemporary music, and sharp dancing in this light-hearted movie. Even though 98% of the dialog is English (great thing for me), I wish the DVD had subtitles to help with some of the quick moments when the character&#39;s accent can be difficult to understand. I wouldn&#39;t judge this movie against Bollywood films, but just on it&#39;s own merits as fun entertainment (a musical people movie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m hooked on Ali Larter as an actress (and her interviews in the Bonus Material indicate she is a nice person). I have since watched this movie several times (gets better each time).

I&#39;m a fan of arty movies, but regretfully I have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel. Agonisingly slow to develop a non-existent plot based on a promising premise, the experience is, shall we say, trying. Even after bad movies I feel that I learn something, or enjoyed some aspect, but there there was nothing to appreciate. The premise was not uninteresting, but the movie starts and ends there. The acting was OK, though the characters were utterly boring. For the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal, she is mightily empty. Pity. I usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic, but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content.

Plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption, murder, power and the rest of thriller related topics. Characters are interesting though sometimes. Not realistic but interesting nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Development is slow like tea drinking ceremony. Visuals not stunning, but good enough to ease the eye strain. Good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed - nothing shocking too much, nothing overexciting. Movie sitcom style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked Woody - excellent performance. Had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good. The rest are bearable though very predictable. The whole is watchable and better than most TV shows.

one of my favorite lines in Shakespeare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i.e. *we&#39;re not finished with you by a long shot* so not only does Shylock not get his pound of flesh, or the 3,000 or the 6,000 or the 36,000 (each of the 6 parts were a ducat) ducats, in a matter of minutes he is ruined by having to forfeit all his possessions. and his daughter has long abandoned him already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;vengeance is a dish best served cold. but Shylock&#39;s attempt at revenge totally backfires. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect this play was and is popular because it caters to the wish we have for justice. but the hard reality is the world is engulfed in injustice and most of it stands. a few big names get tossed in jail, sme gang punks lose their turf to the &#39;good guys&#39; but in reality most of the time it&#39;s the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but not in this play. the long howls of racism and antisemitism forgets that it could well have been any other social outcast group that gets the comeuppance, it&#39;s just that the money lenders of the time were Jews and therefore the needs of the story line puts Shylock the Jew into the role of villain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merchant of Venice is my 3rd favorite work by Shakespeare, 1 and 2 being Hamlet and Macbeth. this production gives excellent treatment of the moral of the story. the scenes with the suitors alone is worth watching. also the awkwardness of the new husbands squirming and minimizing the fact they let the rings so easily slip away that they had sworn to keep forever. in real life, this trick is the thing that spouses coyly use to remind their better half that promises MUST mean something and not be made frivolously. there is far deeper significance to this play than just the comedy/dramatic aspect. it is about loyalty, commitment, and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well worth watching over and over.

Once again, I am amazed that Thomas Gibson did not come to the head of the pack earlier in his career. In this film, Gibson once again demonstrates his ability to grasp a character regardless of sexuality, social status or nationality. Gibson plays a very convincing gay male of the late 20th Century. Tender yet not effeminate, afraid of the basic tenets of love, Gibson&#39;s character touches a variety of emotions. Also worthy of praise is Cameron Bancroft&#39;s performance. His need to be the heterosexual conqueror as opposed to his best friend&#39;s &#34;homosexual conquests&#34; provides dynamics for the relationship that are in many ways unexpected. Bancroft and Gibson&#39;s chemistry is apparent from the first scene they appear in together. There are many &#34;panels&#34; in this quilt. From gay relationships to straight relationships; from heterosexual relationships to the exploration of lesbian love; this film travels across the broad spectrum of sexuality while having the story of a serial killer at its core. My only regret is that it took 6 years since its release before I discovered this movie! I look forward to seeing it again and highly recommend it to any fan of Bancroft, Gibson or Director Denys Arcand.

What was I thinking when I rented this one? What did the distributor think when he copied the tape and shipped it all the way to Holland? That anyone really wanted to see this s***?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s about some astronauts getting into trouble outer space (Apollo 13 flashback, but never even in the shadow of this fine film) and they want to return to home. If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you&#39;re gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere. Deep Impact and Armageddon weren&#39;t perfect either (far from it), but they were at least worth watching once (and maybe one more time when we&#39;re all old). They gave some fun. Max Q doesn&#39;t. It gives irritation. Okay, okay. It&#39;s a TV movie, but does that mean you&#39;re allowed to come up with such a mess?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#39;t choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you&#39;ve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets at its worst at the end when the space shuttle lands on... No, I can&#39;t &#39;spoil&#39; this one (IMDb guidelines forbid it). So you have to see for yourself. NO! DON&#39;T SEE IT (sorry), but rent a movie which is worth renting (like Battlefield Earth... just kidding!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the worst one I have ever seen.

Frankly i just enjoy watching James Caan. Wonderful actor. With such simplicity you know exactly what he&#39;s thinking. A true pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have watched the show from the very beginning and found it different - that&#39;s something that is unique in Hollywood - a new idea - not a 3rd version of a current hit show - &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find the show fun and exciting -I like the pacing - you&#39;re never bored - I especially like the mystery in each episode - the way it unfolds. I am a big mystery fan and have read a lot of the great mysteries but I find the stories in the show well written and the outcome is rarely obvious. Also extremely interesting to me, probably because I am not a gambler, is the different cons that the &#39;gamblers&#39; come up with - I was fascinated by the number of schemes that people have come up with to rob Las Vegas. The music: I like the music at the top of the show. Absolutely perfect for the show...Sets the tone and atmosphere . Just marvelous. And of course, there is James Caan.

Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, &#34;Hey this looks like fun,&#34; - truly I love documentaries - so we started watching it. At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality... I cried, watched some more, laughed, got up to get another Kleenex, then cried some more. Once Jonni Kennedy&#39;s &#34;time was up&#34; he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. I highly recommend this. If you do not fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.

It was a fun film to look at. Though the chance this happened in your street is small, there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell. The simplicity of the film and the humour DO work. I must admit that you don&#39;t have to see it in a theater; it will do very well on a small TV-set. Tip: see it with some close friends.

The 1960&#39;s TV series Bewitched owes it&#39;s idea from this movie. This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart &amp; Kim Novak made right after they were cast together in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This one is not as obsessive as that one but Novak is just as captivating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was Jack Lemmons 10th movie and he is good in support here as well as Ernie Kovacs. The movie has a lot of good things about it. Hermine Gingold is very good in this movie, almost as good in support here as she was in The Music Man. The cast is very solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie has a late 1950&#39;s New York City feel &amp; a cat that is as hexing as any feline in any movie. It is well worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any, &amp; a little magic too boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not Vertigo but I think because it followed that movie, viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved - sure am glad that William Asher saw it, so that the 1960&#39;s series got created. I am not so glad about what Will Ferrell did to it on the big screen, this movie is much better than that.

This has got to be the funniest movie I have seen in forever. Chritopher Guest is truly talented. He has a gift for humor. I almost died laughing. Actually, when I saw this in theaters, I considered walking out because the movie was so dumb. But it is dumb in a good way. It is funny-dumb. And this is a really good combination. You will be laughing from start to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mockumentary style film follows an array of characters all competing at the Kennel Club Dog Show. The cast includes Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Catherine O&#39;Hara, John Michael Higgens, Michael McKean, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and tons more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a truly funny movie that will have everyone laughing. Someone born without a personality would laugh at this film. It is presented in widescreen to give the image that you are viewing an actual documentary and that is probably what adds to the hilarity. BEST IN SHOW: 5/5.

one word boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the young demi looks good, but she&#39;s pregnant (- point for that =D) the movie is not scary at all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the first scenes looked little crappy, i could render better clouds with my laptop, and after effects. but that was then... and now is now. some movies do not get old well... this is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not worth renting or buying... get something better instead like the exorcist, ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;next =D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh the drama part in the beginning just and simply suxor =D

In the fifties the age restrictions for films in Brazil were the following: no restriction, 10 years old, 14 years old and 18 years old. Usually the westerns were allowed for ten years old, when they had a bit more of violence they would go to 14, but it was rare to see a western restricted for younger than 18. Winchester 73 was one of those, and I think this explains very well how this film was considered different from average. The hero, James Stewart was fighting against his own brother who had killed their father. He was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized, far from the average good guy. Anthony Mann tried variations on this type of character in the next films he did with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the leading lady was far from virtuous, she kept following the man who stayed with the rifle. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those great villains that will always be remembered. The story of the film, which always follows the man who stays with the rifle, is one of the best suited for a western. It was to be made into a Fritz Lang film, which did not come through. When it was offered to Mann he made a point of starting from zero again and not taking anything that was prepared for Lang. With Winchester, Mann created a different conception of western, but still maintaining all its traditions. Winchester still is a great film to see again and again, but nothing will be comparable to the impression it made in those who saw it when it was originally released.

This parody is cleverly done: from the songs (Express Yourself becomes Expose Yourself, Like a Prayer is now Party in my Pants and Vogue is now Vague) to the fake interviews of the cast of the show, this movie is hilarious. Remember Madonna saying she didn&#39;t know about the rain season in Asia? In this one, she doesn&#39;t know about the volcano season. It is a precious jewel. They got a lot of money on that spoof, and it pays off. Highly recommended!!!

While watching a mundane modern movie (The Runaway Bride) with my granddaughter (age 22) she asked me &#34;Since you&#39;ve been watching movies since 1938, what is the greatest movie of your lifetime?&#34; Boy! What a choice that is! It took me all summer of thought and relooking a some flicks before I made my decision. It is &#34;THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES&#34;. This movie has no flaws. It is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story. There is not a single part in the film which could be left out. The young girl&#39;s fixation with her brothers lack of hands, the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, the portrayal of a young man whose only responsiblity was as a soda jerk who became the leader of a group of men, and was awarded medals for his action. A women who must now adjust to the husband who&#39;s life has been away from her for years. The realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf. The look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands. A parents first look and reaction to their son&#39;s new deformities. A man used to making life and death decision in a instant, having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative bank&#39;s loan structure. This is no sympathetic, tear jerking, heart strumming act. THIS WAS REAL LIFE! It could not have been portrayed any different. This, my friends, is HOW IT WAS!! This could easily be considered a documentary. In this day of color film, please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest B/W filming, editing and directing you will ever see. The casting was perfect. If I could, I would make it compulsory for anyone taking history, film making, creative writing, sociology, family counciling or psychology to view and report on this magnificent example of the film makers art.

Somehow they summed up the 60&#39;s, ten years that radically changed our country, in four hours. And what a painful four hours it was. They trivilized the major events and happenings and they &#34;claimed&#34; it was about two families yet you barely saw the african-american family. If I were NBC I would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash. What was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways, but managed to attend every major 60&#39;s event through the country. And the second family was such a non-factor. They devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family. That poor son... Please NBC, do not make any movies about any other eras....leave that to PBS and the History Channel

A malfunction in space sends astronaut Neil Stryker (Glenn Corbett) off course and headed to something of a parallel world, called Terra, circling the sun exactly opposite Earth. As a being from space would pose a threat to this world&#39;s order, Stryker is held until a determination can be made as to exactly what to do with him. Stryker, however, gets suspicious of his surroundings and escapes. With the help of a sympathetic nurse and a old scientist who opposes the government, Stryker will try to board a spaceship and head back to Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stranded in Space (or The Stranger if you prefer) is another of those 70s made-for-TV movies that was to be turned into a regular, weekly show. In this case, it&#39;s easy to see why it didn&#39;t make it. First off, there&#39;s nothing new about the show&#39;s set-up. It was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula used by The Fugitive or The Incredible Hulk or Planet of the Apes. You know, a stranger constantly on the move going from one town to the next taking whatever odd job he can all the while being pursued by a government agency or newspaper reporter. It&#39;s a formula that&#39;s been done to death. The second strike against Stranded in Space is its lead, Glenn Corbett. Could this guy come across any less likable? I was rooting for him to get caught. Without sympathy for the main character, this kind of show would never work. Finally, this is supposed to be science fiction. Just because everyone is left-handed and someone has hung three fake looking moons on the horizon I&#39;m supposed to jump to the conclusion that this is some distant planet? So it&#39;s a mere coincidence that they all speak English, dress just like people on Earth, and drive Plymouth Furies? Yeah, right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lone highlight for me was the inclusion of Cameron Mitchell in the cast. Sure, it&#39;s difficult to watch him in something this dreadful, but you know the old saying - any Cameron is better than no Cameron (yeah, I&#39;ve never heard it either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with a lot of these 70s made-for-TV movies, I watched Stranded in Space courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I wouldn&#39;t call it a great episode by any stretch of the imagination, but there are a few good jokes along the way. So in the end, while I rate the movie a 2/10, it gets a 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.

Everyone&#39;s favorite trio of bumbling imbeciles run amok in a hospital in this incredibly raucous and often hysterically funny romp. These guys are without a doubt the single most incompetent bunch of doctors to ever fumble their way across the screen. Comic highlights include the Stooges constantly breaking a glass pane in a door, their encounter with a deranged patient who claims that rats used to come out of the buttonhole of his shirt, the Stooges riding through the hallways on a giant bicycle, a huge horse, and miniature race cars, and our sublimely stupid threesome accidentally leaving instruments inside a hapless patient&#39;s abdomen after they finish operating on the poor fellow. Director Ray McCarey relates the frantic comic shenanigans at an appropriately nonstop hectic pace and stages the broad slapstick gags with considerable gusto. Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Curly Howard are all in peak loopy form, with sterling support from Dell Henderson as long-suffering hospital supervisor Dr. Graves, squeaky-voiced Jeanie Roberts as a hiccuping nurse (the scene where the Stooges do an absurd impromptu group singalong with this gal is absolutely sidesplitting!), Ruth Hiatt as a whispering nurse, Billy Gilbert as the ranting crazy patient, and &#34;Little Billy&#34; Rhodes as a feisty tiny patient. The spirited lunacy never lets up for a minute, thereby making this beautifully berserk baby one of the Stooges&#39; best-ever outings.

Christopher Nolan&#39;s first directorial effort, a year before he did &#34;Memento,&#34; and this is almost as brilliant as that classic. He uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell his story, and it&#39;s a very clever one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they&#39;re all about. One day, he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what he&#39;s up to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cobb is a burglar and he takes Bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes. Both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there&#39;s an ulterior motive for Cobb nurturing this relationship, and it all ties in very smartly at the end. No, I won&#39;t spoil it but this is a very cool movie and I&#39;m beginning to think Christopher Nolan is a genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like suspense films with surprise endings, this one is a must see.

I am appalled to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this &#34;film&#34;. This movie has no redeeming factors. The music is not good, the acting is pathetic, I have a difficult time understanding how someone could enjoy this movie, let alone sing its &#34;praises&#34;. The idea is horrible, certain scenes linked to the plot (such as the continued love story even though the male romantic interest is a SHRUNKEN HEAD) are so bad that I wanted to do myself bodily harm while watching them. The fact that there is scene in which a shrunken head flies under a girls&#39; shirt so he can &#34;feel her up&#34; AND she likes it is reason enough for everyone associated with this film to perish. The link to West Side Story can only be a mockery, since to reference such a great movie in such a horrible one is grounds alone to destroy all copies of this movie. To make a long story short, this film is horrible in every way. And if I had my way, everyone who likes it should go straight to hell....

This film is one of Michael Keaton&#39;s best. Throughout the film he is &#39;on&#39;. With co-stars like Ms. Henner, Joe Piscopo and Danny DeVito, you can&#39;t go wrong. Great laughs, great fun for everyone.

If you saw the grudge, a another mediocre ghost movie then you should know what to expect, just worse, a lot worse. This Time instead of being in Japan with all English speaking people we are in Spain with all English speaking people. It is interesting that not one shot of this movie actually looks like Spain and could have been entirely filmed in a studio back lot. Oh and a place with swings, cause there&#39;s a good 5 mins of footage of swings with no one on them, oooohhh how spooky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is terrible in every way imaginable. The acting by the lameinator mom and dad don&#39;t help matters at all. Anna Paquin is the only person that delivers a decent performance in the film but I hate Anna Paquin so you can imagine my own private hell viewing this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one good moment in the movie, however, when a villain is trying to explain the convoluted plot to Anna Paquin&#39;s character and she doesn&#39;t understand any of it and asks a bunch of stupid questions and he blurts out &#34;You IDIOT, you have not understood anything!&#34; lol. Well I happen to understand this film is a piece of garbage. 0 stars.

The idea was awesome, the actors were incredible, the story could of been very scary, but the writing was poor and there was no depth. I couldn&#39;t really get into this movie. I couldn&#39;t feel for the characters, there were a lot of cliffhangers, and the movie just ends very weirdly. Was it a happy ending? I don&#39;t know. Was it a sad ending? Again, I don&#39;t know. You leave the theater feeling unsatisfied. The movie had so much to give, but couldn&#39;t. Just because you can edit, doesn&#39;t mean you should, right? I wouldn&#39;t really recommend this movie because you just can&#39;t say that you left the movie feeling like it was completed. You&#39;ll just be confused. Trust me, you will probably thank me if you don&#39;t watch this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10

I wasn&#39;t going to watch this show. But, I&#39;m glad I did. The critics of this just don&#39;t get it! It&#39;s one of the funniest and most entertaining thing on T.V at the present moment! Though, when the interviews were done with common folks they probably seemed useless; but, put them in the mouth of animals and insects, and it&#39;s a laugh riot. I laughed so hard, I had tears in my eyes. The pig with the babies suckling and her mother is priceless. The husband and wife birds talking about health problems, and the male bird taking a crap after the wife said she was constipated completely broke me up! Creature Comforts is the most imaginative show I&#39;ve ever seen in awhile! Hopefully, it will be back next summer when this run is over.

Watching this movie and then listening to the commentary, it&#39;s clear that Michael Radford doesn&#39;t understand this play. The first clue that he fails to fully grasp the work is that he takes pains to set the film in seventeenth-century Venice. Which sounds truly odd, yes, that misunderstanding the film would mean trying to make it as accurate to its location as possible. But anyone who&#39;s studied Shakespeare knows that, while he set most of his plays in exotic locals, the culture and values are always contemporary England. This doesn&#39;t hurt the film, but it displays a lack of necessary knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where Radford kills the film is in making it so dead serious. He manages to suck every joke out of the script, leaving the whole production flat. Every ounce of passion is beaten out of the characters. Even Shylock&#39;s &#39;Do we not bleed&#39; speech is a mild, awkward ranting from a choleric who seems to only be saying and doing what he does because he&#39;s supposed to. The lovers are solemn and far too restrained (Joseph Fiennes delivers some of the most romantic lines in the cinema this year in a barely audible whisper), Gratiano (who has to promise to behave at one point) is more sober and collected than Bassiano (who makes him promise to behave), Jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spends her life with Lorenzo pouting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the commentary for the bland and watered-down court scene, the director voices his shock that an audience laughed at Portia&#39;s &#39;A pound of flesh, no more, no less&#39; sentence; ultimately concluding that it had to tension release laughter. &#39;The Merchant of Venice&#39; is a comedy and Radford scoffs at the idea that the most absurd and hysterical portions of the story are anything but the most daringly provocative drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film has no intelligible focus, yet cuts out some of the most entertaining scenes. The characters are forced into high drama veils, so they come out sounding like Ibsen characters reading Victorian poetry. And the comedic ending, where all of the good guys go to bed happy, is drowned in a dignified despair that feels like they&#39;re finding stiff- upper-lip peace with impending death, rather than reconciling with lovers. Even Lancelot and Antonio exit the film holding their hats like aristocratic mourners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is poorly done because the creative powers that be don&#39;t understand the script. It is stern where it should hysterical. It is reserved where it should be passionate. It is Michael Radford where it should be William Shakespeare.

All of those who voted less than 5 are obviously not fans of clean, tongue-in-cheek humor. Keaton is brilliant in this - as in most of his work. This is not a blockbuster, bigger-than-life affair. This is campy, slapstick humor played out by some of Hollywood&#39;s best (and very versatile) actors. Piscopo was equally on the mark as the top dog wannabee, once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see the funniest attempt at not really cussing ever filmed, you gotta see Dimitri do his piece as Morone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 7.

A terrible movie containing a bevy of D-list Canadian actors who seem so self-conscious about the fact they are on-camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is badly written, badly edited, and badly directed. It is disjointed, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what he is given, but is the only one in this film to do so - he really has a bad story and script to work with. It&#39;s not even camp enough to be funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to see Van Pelleske act in a credible manner, and even the sub-characters like Eisen (with his nasal, whiny voice) confirm that we are on a lot in Toronto rather than on a barge off Africa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#39;t the director see that the &#39;creature&#39; looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit? The fight between the blue bolts of lightning and Pelleske&#39;s orange wisps of &#39;magic&#39; (!?! for lack of a better word), is obviously the result of bad actors, with no choreographer, overlaid with completely derivative special effects. Was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film (not the good kind)? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn from the mistakes of others ... don&#39;t even waste your time with this one, you&#39;ll regret it like I did. I have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid.

Based on the excellent novel, Watchers by Dean Koontz, is this extremely awful motion picture that probably shouldn&#39;t be viewed by anyone. Not since &#34;The Running Man&#34; have I seen a book butchered so far beyond recognition. The difference, however, is that &#34;The Running Man&#34; film was still enjoyable as an amusing action film laden down a million catch phrases. This film Nope, nothing remotely amusing. In fact, if you love the book, as I do, you&#39;ll hate this bastardization even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**WARNING**CONTAINS SPOILERS** Rightio, I&#39;m basically going to tell you the story here, almost in it&#39;s entirety. Why? Because you, dear reader, do not also need to suffer through this abominationit&#39;s okay for me, because I enjoy watching crap. Because I like complaining about sh*tty things. Now, on to the nasty: This film revolves around a boy and his mother running away from the government and a mutant-monkey-creature-soldier which escaped from a destroyed Government genetics lab with a super-smart golden retriever which the &#34;hero&#34; calls &#34;Furface.&#34; Groan Trust me, in the novel, this story rocked. I&#39;ll get to that later. Anyway, the hero is none other that dreamy boy-child Corey Haim. Oh, I&#39;m not kidding. Our hero runs around, crackly voice and all, trying to convince his Mom to help save this dog from the &#34;evil government&#34; which birthed him and made him genetically ultra-smart. The monkey-creature, retardedly referred to as an &#34;Oxcom&#34; (God help us) is also a genetic-stew of a creature built to be the ultimate fighter on battlefields of the future. Michael Ironside (Total Recall, Starship Troopersalways plays a badass) is also in this film, and no, I couldn&#39;t figure out how anyone convinced him this would be a good idea. He plays a government agent with the NSO hunting the dog and creature. Oh yeah, here&#39;s some spoilerama: He&#39;s also a creation from the government, and the same lab, and lo and behold spends most of the movie being a prick and killing peopleand all that killing is supposed to be done by the monkey-soldier. Instead of a rockin&#39; kick-ass, creepy horror film, we have a rectal hemorrhage of a teenybopper horror flick. The dog&#39;s intelligence is discovered all-too-conveniently, and believed easier than we believe we can see clouds by looking outside. Breakdown!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change from Book to Film:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Lead character (Travis) turned from man to boy-child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Man&#39;s love interest in book (Nora), is now his motherand all her depth and character growth is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Lem Johnson, black man, is now white Mr. Ironside. This matters as the character&#39;s strength was built on his heritage in the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Relationship between two authority figures completely ignored, Lem now kills the guy who was originally his best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--One principle character in the book is now totally absent, the &#34;immortal&#34; that hunted the heroes--maybe this is supposed to be Ironside, but then why is he someone else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dog never receives deserving name of &#34;Einstein&#34; in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--No part of the book took place in a High Schoolat least nothing that had strong bearing on the plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Takes place over a matter of days, rather months like the bookunrealistic pacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Corey Haim&#39;s girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters in the book--and they never met in the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Character of Lem Johnson is no longer cool-headed; instead, he&#39;s a total asshole that bullies his way through people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Hero Travis was part of Delta Force (military segment specializing in hunting terrorists), instead, his Dad, who is never seen in the film, was part of that group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Perceived intelligence in the monster now totally absent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Subplots involving Soviets and The Mob completely gutted out of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--These are just the most obnoxious changes, and the one&#39;s I could remember off hand (and a day later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Eventually, after 90-odd minutes of pain and mental anguish, the movie ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#39;t Hurt It, Didn&#39;t Help It:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Michael Ironsideusually, I like him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The dog is still fairly likable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Wacky &#34;totally 80&#39;s&#34; title screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Okay, the writing for one is extremely awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The direction is so half-assed that anyone watching the film will feel superior to everyone involved in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The acting is crappy and weak, especially from Corey Haim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Loose, weak, watered down story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The monster looks just pathetic, that is, when we are actually allowed to see the bloody thing. Its head is gigantically over-sized, the yellow eyes that were so much a part of the thing in the book are seen for no more than two seconds. Instead of a lean, powerful, fast, intelligent killing machine, we have some jackass in a puke-ugly monkey suit forced upon us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Absolutely no character development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Even the violence and gore are done poorly, for f*ck sakes, this is supposed to be a HORROR film!! Usually violence is at least done well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The idea that Dean Koontz whored out his brilliant novel to become this filthy f*cking piece of sh*t brings me dangerously close to vomiting all over myself and anyone near me. There are movies worse than this (headache-inducing as that idea may seem), but so far, only &#34;Alien vs Predator,&#34; at least to me, is a bigger travesty and more painful disappointment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Memorable Scene: Watching the end credits start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting: 3/10 Story: 4/10 (the novel was really good, this is just terrible) Atmosphere: 5/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character Development: 1/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 4/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 Violence/Gore: 4/10 Music: 5/10 Direction: 3/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 3/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that no one watch this movie ever, except for a few extreme die-hard horror fansand only if you haven&#39;t read the novel. Instead, I would recommend that anyone interested in this avoid it entirely and buy/check/borrow the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.ResidentHazard.com

I actually saw this movie at a theater. As soon as I handed the cashier my money, she said two words I had never heard at a theater, before or since: &#34;No refunds!&#34; As soon as I heard those words, I should have just waved bye-bye to my cash and gone home. But no, foolishly, I went in and watched the movie. This movie didn&#39;t make ANYONE in the theater laugh. Not even once. Not even inadvertantly! Mostly, we sat there in stunned silence. Every ten minutes or so, someone would yell &#34;This movie SUCKS!&#34; The audience would applaud enthusiastically, then sit there in stunned, bored silence for another ten minutes.

Is this film a joke? Is it a comedy? Surely it isn&#39;t a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is any intended humor, but on quite a few occasions the poor acting, poor directing, and appalling script had the audience laughing out loud in the cinema. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist just reaching his peak shot dead by an assassin he walks in on by mistake. The killer sees the young artists work portfolio he is carrying and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. At the exhibition the assassin meets the dead artists sister and they end up falling in love. It is all very predictable stuff and the end will not have anyone guessing as it is so poorly scripted. The film takes place mainly in and around Vienna, Austria, and shows what a beautiful city it is. Do not waste your time on this film though, unless you are studying how NOT to act, direct or script a film!

Origins of the Care Bears &amp; their Cousins. If you saw the original film you&#39;ll notice a discrepancy. The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears, rather than meeting them later. However I have no problems with that, preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. The babies are adorable and it&#39;s fun watching them play and grow. My favourite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter. I could empathise with the three children since I was never good at sports either. Cree Summer is excellent as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, love the toys or enjoyed the original, this is not to be missed. 9/10

Assy McGee is an out-of-control, hard-nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas. The twist here is that Assy is literally a walking buttocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheap, low-brow facade of the show belies its cleverness and hidden satire. That is not to say that Assy is devoid of fart jokes, just that the toilet humor is used sparingly enough to elicit consistent laughs, not groans and eye-rolls. The title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever, subtle humor used throughout. The sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme. In one photo, a police cruiser is shown and the &#34;camera&#34; zooms in on the front license plate holder, which is vacant. The meaningless zoom-in satirizes the production of the typical 70s-80s cop drama and, incidentally, makes me laugh every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the typical characters are included: the frustrated police chief who can&#39;t control Assy; the loyal, minority partner who acts as a foil to Assy&#39;s recklessness; the regular cops who detest Assy&#39;s means.... all are accounted for and all are hilarious satires of the typical police drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The voice acting, primarily performed by Larry Murphy, is nothing less than spectacular. Assy&#39;s voice--breathy and gruff with a bit of a drunken slur--is so clever and unique that it ranks alongside all-time greats like Stewie Griffin (Family Guy) and Homer Simpson (Simpsons). Though the voice is slurred, the diction is somehow clear and easy to understand. This is a nice change from other Adult Swim program voices that often require closed captioning to understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the fantastic production and voice acting, the script is also hilarious. Assy&#39;s no- nonsense directness fuels most of the humor, particularly in his interactions with citizens outside the police force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have access to the Adult Swim comedies, Assy McGee is certainly worth the watching. Each episode clocks in at a mere 8-9 minutes, so you really have little to lose.

(Some Spoilers) Facing a mid-life crisis and fed up with his marriage to Cindy ,Teddi Siddall, who seemed to have more say in what he did and where he stayed then the Air Force,USAF elite Red Beret Sgt. Major Davis Bay, Gary Cole,decided one morning to just walk away from in all and start a new life as a civilian. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David first got this idea when he met at a Halloween party sweet and adoring Alyson, Karen Sillas. Keeping his background secret from her by telling Alyson that he&#39;s in a top secret military outfit was the perfect cover for him. Back at Jackson AFB outside of Austin Tex. David starts to review his life&#39;s options with Cindy and the USAF and decides to change his identity by running away from it. David then calls Alyson, who only met him once, and makes a date with her. Before you know it David, now using the name Haywood,is engaged to be married to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faking his death in a bicycle accident Dave purposely leave his wife and kids out in the cold and deserts his military obligation to his country.It didn&#39;t take long for Dave to find out that civilian life just doesn&#39;t appeal to him. It&#39;s now too late for Dave to go back to his first wife Cindy and his two boys with him facing the brig and a military court-martial if he comes back to the USAF. Dave takes up the only job that he could do to support him and Alyson and their infant son Chris: using his skills he learned in the Red Berets to rob banks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a true story &#34;Lies He Told&#34; has Dave Bay/Haywood living three, not two, different lives. One of a hard working family man one as a ruthless bank robber and yet another one as a dead and highly decorated, by the President of the US and Prime Misnister Of GB, All-American hero. Gary Cole is very effective as both Master Sgt. David Bay&amp;husband David Haywood. Davids actions are, even though unforgivable, understandable in the case of his depression over his marriage to Cindy. The pressure of her nagging him got to the point where he just wanted to get lost and away from her and the kids. But he should have sought professional counseling from the US Air Force, which he would have been gladly provided with, instead of choosing the easy way out. Which in the end lead him straight into Levenworth Ferderal Prison. It may have been that the overly macho Dave thought it would have been a bad mark on his career, as well as his ego, to get help for his problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen Sillas as Alyson is the glue that keeps the film together with her at first going along with her new husbands explanation of his frequent disappearances, some for as much as two weeks, as him doing covert action in keeping the country safe from domestic and foreign terrorists. The real reasons for his long absences were the result of him casing out planing and robbing banks. Which was the only way he knew how to earn a living given from what he learned, in subversive actions, all those years in the elite Red Berets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alyson tracking down Dave&#39;s mom Carolyn Bay(Linda Goranson), who he told her was dead since he was a small boy, in Portland she finds out the truth about the double, or triple, life that he&#39;s been leading since he married her. This lead to Alyson finding out about his marriage to Linda and the two sons that he had with her as well as his faked death, and now AWOL, from the USAF. Being that it&#39;s a true story the ending was anything that you would have guessed it to be in a standard Hollywood, or made for TV, movie. That&#39;s what makes the film &#34;Lies he Told, a lot better then what you would have expected it to be.

Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. The script for James &#39;Jimmy&#39; Trivette, Walker&#39;s sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as Wesley Crusher on Star Trek TNG, and is played with about as much conviction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this show, people don&#39;t respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless Walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). That&#39;s not how life works, that&#39;s not how people are. This show doesn&#39;t take place in this reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot lines are about as realistic as Murder She Wrote, a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people&#39;s houses without them getting angry, and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her. With Walker, everyone on the show, including the &#34;bad guys&#34;, act like he&#39;s the sort of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of, and time itself bends to his whim. The lines that sometimes come out of people&#39;s mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous. It&#39;s as if the scriptwriter for the part of Wesley Crusher (for the &#34;serious&#34; parts) and the scriptwriter for Bob Saget&#39;s funniest home videos (for the &#34;humor&#34; parts) got together and wrote all the scripts for this show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. It&#39;s for the elderly. It&#39;s for wishful thinkers. It&#39;s for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending. It&#39;s for people who want to drift away into oblivion. It&#39;s for people whose drug of choice is their television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cringe every time I see even a commercial for this show. My opinion is that it is THE worst show to be on television in the last 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to like Chuck Norris, but this show has forever tainted him in my mind. I can&#39;t even watch his older movies without thinking of this show.

Bo is Jane Parker, whose long-lost anthropologist father (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very inconsistent career) is in Africa studying something or another. She tracks him down (how?) and he tells her of the natives&#39; stories of a giant monster whose nightly howling can be heard throughout the jungle. Turns out to be the Ape Man himself (Miles O&#39;Keeffe, who has the film&#39;s best dialogue), who rescues her from bad guys and falls in love with her, leaving them just enough time in this agonizing two hours to romp naked while a horny monkey looks on and cheers. Normally I&#39;m very open-minded to varying opinions about any film, but this is the sole exception. This is the worst film ever made. If you don&#39;t agree, you haven&#39;t seen it. (Notes: Newsday called it &#34;unendurable,&#34; which is the best one-word summary I can think of. The Maltin Movie Guide comments that they almost had to think of a rating lower than BOMB.)

I never comment on a film, but I have to say that this was one of the worst films that I have ever seen. I feel it was made by a beginner film student and not to put down talented film students, but this was horrible! I did not buy the lead actress and felt I was in acting class with her while she was on film. Her decisions were very safe and I feel she was mimicking other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions. The direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves. The end may have made a little more sense if there was someone narrating the events and not a song. I love Patsy Cline but she her songs appear quite frequently in films. Maybe the song selection could have been a little more original. The song &#34;crazy&#34; was such a cliché. As I said before I never comment on films and have seen my share of good and bad, but this was the worst. Sorry.

As a community theater actor who works hard at it but doesn&#39;t take acting too seriously, I&#39;m always amused by those who treat it as Great Art. This movie skewers the &#34;Actor&#39;s Craft&#34; mercilessly while dishing up a lot of good laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A ham actor on location for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator. When the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drink and food, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play &#34;the part of a lifetime&#34; by the neo-Nazi head of the secret service. He plays it to the hilt, gets the dictator&#39;s girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa, and turns the tables on his captors beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of great shtick by the leads, lots of good work by some unknown supporting actors, particularly the household staff and two members of the palace guard, and fun little cameos abound. Sammy Davis Jr. makes light of himself, Jonathan Winters plays a semi-retired American businessman with something else going on, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, and above all Richard Dreyfuss are exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a dumb movie, but it has lots of beautiful locations (in Brazil), a humorous script, and good actors doing their thing and looking like they&#39;re actually having fun and not going through the usual existential angst about what is only play-acting!

This movie is standard goofy sci-fi fare from the 50s. In its favor, the plot does manage to pull off an alien invasion without actually producing the aliens themselves. But come on now, if aliens needed energy and could absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs, why would they come to earth? Why wouldn&#39;t they just suck it out of a STAR!?!? The only credible reason for the presence of Kronos is a direct attack on Earth society, not the mere collection of energy. Nothing like that is even intimated; Kronos may have been built by a superior race but its activities on Earth are the most primitive. The end that the scientist-heroes plan for Kronos is based on nothing but pseudo-scientific gibberish. It amounts to the &#34;reverse the polarity&#34; gambit which has been used so much in bad scifi it has become a joke in itself. Low and behold, this causes our unwanted visitor to release its collected energy. No one in power seems to care about the impact the release of that much energy (which by the film&#39;s end includes, among other things, the entire yield of a hydrogen bomb) will have on the surroundings. And unfortunately, by the time the movie ends, the surroundings are the suburbs of Los Angeles. Whoops!

This Belgian film, directed by Tom Barman, singer of the well-known group dEUS, will not be favoured by everyone. For the simple reason that there isn&#39;t a clear story or even a plot. This movie just shows 24 hours in &#34;a city&#34; (here Antwerp) and allows you to watch and truly enjoy the dialogues, the directing, the humorous (Dario!, the osteopath Bruno!, ...) and tragic (Windman, Paul Garcin, ...) characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several memorable scenes: the Windman on the beach, the dance party at the end, the KISS-fan, Windman visits the osteopath,...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly some other viewers didn&#39;t understand what&#39;s so beautiful and interesting in this movie. They complain that this movie has no story, etc. But it&#39;s the atmosphere that keeps you watching and that will drag you into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you didn&#39;t watch it yet, be sure to listen carefully to the music. The soundtrack is extraordinary just like Tom Barman and his group dEUS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And &#34;ssst, mondje dicht hé.&#34; (don&#39;t tell anyone)

OK, I&#39;ve now seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror/suspense films recently as I worked my way through various 50 pack collections, and I have to say, the guy had a limited range, but he was good at what he did. He wasn&#39;t Karloff, but PRC was lucky to have him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the poor guy was stuck in a kind of back-water ghetto of horror films, and he wasn&#39;t good enough to take them to the next level of interest....not with the thread-bare screenplays and direction and budgets he worked under. That&#39;s the case here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is, well, slow, stodgy and unexciting for the most part. The &#34;heroine&#34; seems to be doomed to be a rent-a-center version of Judy Garland, the &#34;hero&#34; is bland as white rice, and the poor guy playing the monster doesn&#39;t even get a good transformation scene out of the deal. His make up effects aren&#39;t scary at all - he looks like a slightly more shaggy version of a farm hand, is all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not a total waste. Zucco looks good on camera, he chews the scenery while managing to deliver some terribly affected and contrived set speeches without flinching or losing the flow. There are some moody B&amp;W shots here and there that don&#39;t completely suck. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all...this movie helped some &#34;C&#34; through &#34;Z&#34; level actors pay their rent for another month, and it never sinks below a certain hacked out level of quality. Watch it once if you like George Zucco, or just feel the need to see every wolfman-themed movie ever made.

Cornel Wilde and three dumbbells search for sunken treasure in the south Atlantic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treasure-hunters led by Wilde fight a group of territorial sharks with cute little sneers on their hungry faces. Wilde and his merry men must find a way to take themselves off the menu so they can begin excavating an old Spanish galleon filled with gold bullion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the crew engages in a small eternity of pushing, shoving, arguing, and listening to Wilde&#39;s annoying health tips, 5 crazy convicts board the boat and complicate things. Now it is a battle of wits as to who gets the treasure and who gets to see what the inside of a shark&#39;s stomach looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least Wilde is in shape wearing exactly the same thing he wore in &#39;The Naked Prey&#39; 10 years earlier and he has remained in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made on a budget of 75 cents.

This is a really well made movie. Sumitra Bhave has always made sensible cinema and this is my favourite film by her. This movie should have won the National Award and would have been my pick to represent India at the Oscars. It is at least a thousand times better than &#39;Shaaws&#39;, which is going to the Oscars, from India, this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is such a pity that the information about this (and all other Indian movies) on IMDb is lacking and sometimes even wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar played a very important character in this movie and he is not even credited on these pages. The rest of the cast and crew too are not mentioned at all. Awards and nominations for this movie are not given even when Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this movie. There was not even a single vote cast for &#39;Doghi&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Doghi&#39; is not a Hindi movie. It is Marathi, and thankfully escapes the song and dance sequence, does not get tangled up in glitzy glamour and half-witted designer ware. It is a real life, soulful story that is made with a rare understanding and respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Doghi&#39; which can roughly be translated as &#39;two women&#39; is a story of two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. It is actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not venture into many sub plots, and that makes it a very difficult film to direct. The entire movie is set in a non-descript remote village in Maharashtra and the screen rarely ventures far from the house of the two female protagonists. No aesthetic sunsets in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie opens and we are introduced to the entire house, which is preparing for Gauri&#39;s wedding. Gauri and Krishna&#39;s father being a hard working farmer, the house is full and happy; there is nothing wanting in their simple lives. However on the eve of the wedding Gauri&#39;s to-be-husband meets with a fatal accident. Gauri&#39;s father cannot bear the tragic news and suffers a major stroke. Without a strong, working member the house could have fallen apart but Gauri&#39;s mother shoulders the responsibility. She works as and when she can, but cannot make ends meet. But her life still, is easier than Gauri&#39;s. Superstitions, that people half-heartedly try to forget, make Gauri an evil luck bringer. She is outcast from the society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gauri&#39;s mother writes to her brother. Desperate for help she accepts his suggestion. He takes Gauri off to Mumbai where she is made to work in brothels. Gauri sends home the money she earns and their conditions improve. Gauri gives her life for that of her family&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However when Gauri returns home for Krishna&#39;s wedding, her mother does not come out to meet her. She does not allow Krishna near her and does not allow Gauri in front of the guests. She loves Gauri but fears for Krishna&#39;s life. This breaks Gauri completely and she decides to return to her unfortunate life. But Krishna runs out and holds Gauri. She begs her beloved sister to return. Krishna promises to stand by her. Promises that they would face the world  together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing that is not required in this movie. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes off to Mumbai but what she does there is never told  the subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know. It just the bare story, which is profound in its simplicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Doghi&#39; is responsible cinema. It is respectful to the subject it handles. It is respectful towards its audience  it does not think them to have the mental capability of a four year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is first rate. The direction is marvelous  the silences carry the story forward in a way, no words could have. The script is well researched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who appreciates good cinema is bound to like &#39;Doghi&#39;.

&#34;Land of Plenty&#34; is not a film. It is a tombstone for the directorial career of German Director Wim Wenders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many felt it in &#34;The Million Dollar Hotel&#34; and now &#34;Land of Plenty&#34; makes it perfectly clear; not only has Wenders lost it, he&#39;s actually turned into a BAD director, creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One might argue that the &#34;time you lose it&#34; comes for every director, but Wenders&#39; case is extreme. It&#39;s as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again - only to get sloppish results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a few words, this film does not deserve your time.

This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly. The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film. A truly, truly bad film.

Is the Cannes controversy-meter remarkably esoteric, or is that we Americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore? Be that as it may, with plenty of careful analyzing, &#34;Falscher Bekenner&#34; at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to Cannes in 2005, a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to it&#39;s glum American re-title (&#34;Low Profile&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Building on familiar themes of Bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation (kind of), admittedly it&#39;s a film not without it&#39;s surface-level interests. It starts out with a grabber, as a haunting shot of a desolate off-the-highway road focuses in on a teenage drifter, who ultimately walks by a totaled car, where supposedly a brutal hit-and-run has left the driver dead in a gory mess. Stunned, he does nothing but pick up a scrap of the remaining engine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just out of school, the drifter turns out to be Armin Steebe, a product of the German suburbs with minimal ambition. Persisentily pressured by his caring but somewhat nagging parents to find a good job, he endures interview after interview with every haughty interviewer along with it, every one with the same fruitless outcome. Getting mighty sick of it, his aforementioned highway encounter soon provokes his first act of rebellion: claiming responsibility for the crime which he did not commit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretending to fill out more applications and going to more and more bizarre job interviews by sunrise, he partakes in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism way after sundown. As the days get shorter and the nights get much hotter, as he goes on living in his suburban neighborhood as if he&#39;s doing nothing out of the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you seem confused about what exactly is going on, don&#39;t worry about being the only one: this is about as far and coherent as the story gets. The plot seems simple enough, and perhaps due to it&#39;s seemingly direct purposes that&#39;s why &#34;Falscher Bekenner&#34; becomes pointlessly convoluted, becoming enamored with endless false conclusions, dreamlike situations and graphic sex scenes to try and enlighten a story lacking clear logic to an already vague argument (supposedly the soul-numbing effects of the modern suburban wasteland, or something about youth&#39;s fascination with crime. Hey, it could even be a coming-out movie.) at hand. It spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols, both tangible and surrealistically allegorical, but they don&#39;t seem to be really symbolizing anything of interest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most fatal flaw, however, is how the filmmakers paint all it&#39;s characters in a rough shade of vanilla. There&#39;s hardly any distinguishable traits to help understand their purpose, and how the secondary characters (especially the confused relationship between Armin and his rather normal- perhaps too normal- family) catalyze the already under-developed lead character&#39;s &#34;plight&#34; never comes into focus. How are we supposed to identify with this young almost-adult&#39;s rebellion, with little sense of the world he&#39;s living in or the prominent figures around him that help comprise it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people drop in and out of the movie (including Armin&#39;s sort-of girlfriend Katja, and a strange, affluent visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in watching the protagonist eat brownies) and seem to exist for no reason whatsoever. They ultimately just seem like prolonged padding to an already thin story with pointless subplots that continue to prove the movie is drawing a total blank about where to go next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even a movie that supposedly toys with reality (especially with Armin&#39;s nightly exploits), it ends with a literal, almost moralizing head-scratcher that seems to halt questions to a &#34;story&#34; that does little but put it&#39;s viewer in a state of pointlessly exhausted perplexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without any color, it&#39;s impossible to shade anything vital in.

Since Educating Rita, Julie Walters has been one of my role models, and her performance in this as a woman who helps the man she loves get in synch with his feminine side is magnificent. I would never have believed her character in the hands of a lesser actress, but Walters pulls it off with gusto and panache. Adrian Pasdar gives his best performance to-date in the male lead.

Chan is in New York and he gets involved with an attempt to sabotage a new aircraft design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war was over a year away from reaching America but the second world war was already raging everywhere else in the world and so it colored everything since most people probably realized that war was coming. Here the War isn&#39;t mentioned but the fact that the film deals with the production of planes at the very least alludes to it. The mystery itself is pretty good, it the notion of plane sabotage lends itself nicely to a couple of rather tense moments. To be certain we are talking about Charlie Chan so we can be certain that he would live to fight another day, but there was no guarantee what condition he would be in, not whether anyone around him would survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this film a great deal. Its not one of the nest, and far from the worst. It is one of the truly rare things, a truly enjoyable one. Definitely worth a look or six.

Anyone who watched &#34;Alien vs Predator&#34; must&#39;ve known that the conventions of the &#34;Alien Quadrilogy&#34; were not exactly adapted for the film. Amongst some of the unusual elements, the rapid growth of the Aliens over seemingly a matter of minutes, Aliens with extremely long tails, and so on. However the idea of the Predator species providing the impetus of city and temple building to create a hunt for would be warriors sounded so appealing that I couldn&#39;t resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped the end of the film would not be the impetus of this sequel, and unfortunately I was wrong. For those who forgot how the first film ended, the dead Predator had an Alien burst through his chest which carried the traits of both species&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this film, I&#39;m going to just go through a list of &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34; traits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: Lots of gorgeous people, especially the men. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: Lots of gorgeous people get munched by both the mutant Predator/Alien, and the Predator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: An interesting idea of the Predator planet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: An inconsistent scale of a town. Its a small town without many opportunities, but with a very sophisticated (read: big city) sewer system, and homeless. Is it a small town, or a city? The police force is one Sheriff and three Deputies, or so I counted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: Um.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: Why do these mutant Aliens/Predators grow so fast? In a matter of five minutes, they seem to grow to their full size. I mean, c&#39;mon...what are these things...Chia Pet Aliens??? And while we&#39;re on this subject, why is it that an Alien inside a Predator&#39;s body mutates, but an Alien in a human&#39;s body doesn&#39;t? Does that make sense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: Still thinking... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: Why would only one Predator come? And why does it pour acid over all the remnants of the &#34;Aliens,&#34; but it decides to murder a cute deputy, and then skin him and hang him upside down. I mean, so much for being incognito!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: Ah...I&#39;m stuck. I guess there&#39;s lots of loud sounds! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: How do these mutated Alien/Predators procreate? Apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a kiss type of motion, they deposit several offspring into the woman&#39;s body. Yeah, just what you&#39;d like to see, eh? Pregnant women having their bodies explode into mutant aliens- as if the previous way wasn&#39;t gross enough!!!. I mean, there isn&#39;t even an Alien Queen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: Did I say that the guys in this movie are gorgeous? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: When a nuclear device blows apart buildings, how does a helicopter manage to survive the blast? And how tacky is it for one of the passengers to mockingly chide the pilot &#34;I told you not to crash!&#34; I mean, given the nuclear fallout, when he wakes up in the morning, he&#39;ll have no hair left!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on, but I think you get the message. Mutated Alien/Predator bursts through dead Predator&#39;s body, grows over the matter of a couple of minutes, kills all the Predators and manages to get crashed on earth. More mutant Alien/Predators are created, while ONE measly Predator comes to earth to destroy this new mutant species. Predator kills humans. Mutant Alien/Predators kill humans. Humans kill humans. Sucks to be a human in this movie, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re impressed by lots of bangs and bumps, you&#39;ll love this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you liked the first, I suggest you skip this sequel.

The acting- fantastic. The story- amazing. The script- wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few ways to describe this movie. Yes, it&#39;s slow and it has mostly talking, but the whole story of all of their lives and how it&#39;s told with the flashbacks thrown in and out makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story. I, myself, am reading the book that the movie is based off of and it has shown me even more light into this story and answers some questions that were left unanswered in the movie. I&#39;m also to read the Exectioner&#39;s Song, which is the &#39;other&#39; half of the Gilmore story. This movie made me think so much about the phrase &#34;piering into the other side of the looking glass&#34;. You hear a song in the movie called Gary Gilmore&#39;s Eyes, which is by a punk band that wrote a song about what it&#39;d be like to have Gary Gilmore&#39;s eyes(which is one of the things Gary gave as a transplant when he died) and as you listen to it, which is after the last time Mikal ever sees Gary, you look at the whole situation a little differently if you were to only here the song itself. This movie opened my eyes in that way and in many others. I recommend this movie(and the book) very very much.

ok, i am really into King&#39;s stuff, but this is just dreadful. the whole movie, i am waiting for the main character to do something profound with his new youth and power. i can tolerate the worst of movies, as anything is better than watching a cut movie with commercials in it. but this takes the cake. i gave it a 2, and i would never recommend it to anyone.

Sogo Ishii has taken the old myth of Musashibo Benkei and stood it on its head to produce a dark, gory, spellbinding and terrific-looking movie. Those unfamiliar with the legend won&#39;t need to be; the story explains itself nicely as it goes along. Well worth seeking out even though there are no English-language home video versions.

This movie is actually FUNNY! If you&#39;d like to rest your brain for an hour so then go ahead and watch it. It&#39;s called blonde and blonder, so don&#39;t expect profound and meaningful jokes. What this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes. It&#39;s just a funny movie to watch on a date or with a company of friends (especially if you&#39;re not too sober. Lol ) Pamela and Denise are still pretty hot chicks. It&#39;s a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art. C&#39;mon, this movie is about BLONDES! It&#39;s supposed to be light, funny and superficial. One more thing, I do not think that girls will appreciate and like this movie but guy definitely will.

First of all, I think the casting and acting were excellent. The problem is the story. There is basically no story here worth telling and thus basically no movie here. Larry McMurtry has done Lonesome Dove and I can&#39;t fault the original, though it probably didn&#39;t need sequels. He did Hud with Paul Newman, which is one of my favorite movies. Mellencamp is supposed to be a country singer, but the only song I hear him sing is an old Buck Owens song. The movie makes a big deal out of chicken farming. Mellencamp&#39;s character has a good wife, and it&#39;s utterly stupid of him to stray from her. The incident with riding in the sliding cage is utterly stupid. Maybe people do that for fun in some parts of the country, but I never heard of it.

I thought this would be a fun comedy with no sex or nudity in it. Well, there&#39;s no sexual content but as for being a &#34;fun comedy,&#34; I only remember laughing a total three times during &#34;The Green Butchers.&#34; The hilarity is centered around cannibalism and mental retardation, which is just sick humor, in a bad way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have walked out of this film and I&#39;m kicking myself because I didn&#39;t. In fact, I shouldn&#39;t have seen this movie in the first place. The only good that came out of this film was was the fact that Bjarne and his brother finally made amends and put their ugly past behind them. I advise any well-meaning individual to steer clear of this gross-out flick.

I am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s--films so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh. So, because of this it&#39;s natural that I&#39;d choose this film--especially because with John Agar in it, it was practically guaranteed to be bad. Sadly, while it was a bad film, it was the worst type of bad film--dull beyond belief and unfunny. At least with stupid and over-the-top bad films, you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting. Here, you never really see that much of the monster (mostly due to the darkness of the print) and the acting, while bad, is more low energy bad...listless and dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film begins with some young adults going to Satan&#39;s Hollow to neck. Well, considering the name of the place, it&#39;s not surprising when they are later found chewed to pieces! Duh...don&#39;t go necking at Satan&#39;s Hollow!! Well, there are reports of some sort of crashing object from the sky, so what do the teens go? Yep, throw a dance party--a very, very, very slow dance party where the kids almost dance in slow motion. So it&#39;s up to the Sheriff (Agar) and his men to ensure that the teens can dance in peace without fear of mastication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the monster, it&#39;s some guy in a gorilla suit with a silly mask--a bit like the monster in ROBOT MONSTER. Not exactly original and not exactly high tech. To make it worse, it makes snorting noises and moves very, very slowly--so slow that even the most corpulent teen could easily outrun it! How it manages to kill repeatedly is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, too dull to like--even if you are a fan of lousy cinema.

This was one of the best movies I have seen. The movie relates to real life and how drugs CAN play a major part. Although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget, I found it to be exhilarating to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction. However, when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters, there is no direction is life. I feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the cast are newcomers to the industry. However, they all pulled it off very well. Everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control. This movie might just scare them enough to change their ways.

To be completely honest, I completely intrigued by the original concept of &#39;Sleeper Cell.&#39; Having watched the best part of the series on FX Channel (UK), my Sky got broke meaning I missed the crucial finale. But what I DID see of it, I assumed it to be a great story line, good acting and as I don&#39;t watch &#39;24&#39; I thought it was great, AND it&#39;s been confirmed for a second season...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best TV programs I have seen. Much more realistic and believable than &#34;24.&#34; Excellent character development and plot line. Does not bash Islam, but gives a thoughtful and considered approach, showing the difference between radical terrorist Islam and true Islam. Everybody should see this show!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stringy xx

&#34;The Golden Child&#34; was Eddie Murphy&#39;s first film since his megahit &#34;Beverly Hills Cop&#34;. And even though it&#39;s not as good as &#34;Cop&#34;, it&#39;s a fun comic adventure. Murphy stars as a finder of lost children who&#39;s assigned a most unusual case. His assignment: to find the title character, a child with mystical powers. This movie could have been titled &#34;Beverly Hills Cop and the Temple of Doom&#34; since parts of this movie plays like a Spielbergian adventure, kinda like an Indiana Jones comedy. It&#39;s got comedy with laughs, and adventure with special effects. Lots of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** (out of four)

This must be one of the worst movies I&#39;ve ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie, so I can&#39;t say I&#39;m picky. I have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but I just can&#39;t think of anything that matches this, maybe starship troopers 2. Witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my DVD player, but compared to this its effects are great. The acting superb and the script should be awarded. You know when a movie is bad in a funny way, well folks this isn&#39;t one of those this kills your soul minute by minute.

Meester Sharky, you look so ... normal. You would never get a table in this fancy cocktail restaurant/bistro. I, on the other &#39;and eat grapes and pate &#39;ere every day. You like my fur coat with all the fine trimming? My enormous golden rings of gold? Or maybe you like these blonde, &#39;ow you say?, bombshells, who are all qualified in aerobics and naked petanques, who decorate my long, maroon velvety sofa like so many soft boiled larks on a plate of pan fried foie gras and figs. You like? You can&#39;t have! Zey are all mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will never possess &#39;er as I possessed &#39;er. Domino was the best, apart from Maman. You do not understand the art of lovemaking. Just look at your inferior moustache. It is almost funny to me, non, to think of that ludicrous protuberance on your silly face, as you snuffle around Domino&#39;s love hillock like the piggy seeking the truffle in the forest, the forest heaving and swaying in the hot winds of desire! You lose again Sharky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I make love to the women zey know, Sharky, zey know. Zey learn, zey learn until zey become the teacher. Not nano-maths, the arts of love. Domino was the seedling which I watered. I watered her so very often. Everywhere Sharky. Her scented petals, her proud stalk, everywhere. She will wither under your ridiculous hose, like the soufflé removed from the oven five minute too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must go now Sharky, you bore me so with your disgraceful behaviour. It is you who will be flushed down le pissoir like the smelly thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bon chance!

Lonesome Jim is kind of like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are total losers. Both boys around 30, living at home, with absolutely nothing going for them. I live in the Midwest and I can&#39;t name one family like this. I picked it up because I kind of like Buscemi acting humor. Now I realize I need to have a counteracting agent to that humor to make it work. The acting and camera work and editing was fine. The first 15 minutes got you set, and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the film from being totally depressing Jerry Springer trailer trash type of story. The female members of my family were begging me to turn it off, but I prevailed under the premise that there had to be a turning point near the end, and we watched the entire movie. The male family members, as expected, simply walked out after the first 30 minutes.

eXistenZ was a good film, at the first I was wondering what is going on, organic &#34;pods&#34; made out of mutant reptiles which connected you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game via a umbilical cord, well it seems a little odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once it gets going its a pretty good film, with a few twists with a great open ending and the good aspect of weridness throughout the film is entertaining too see as your not sure whats coming next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Security personnel throw away the metal detectors; they have bone guns !

I had heard news about this film from anime-legend Hayao Miyazaki, and I SO wanted to see it. But I was lucky enough to the film online at YouTube; after watching the film, I knew that it is another Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film, inspired by my favorite fairy-tale &#34;The Little Mermaid,&#34; is about a 5-year-old boy named Sosuke, and his relationship with a goldfish princess, whom he named Ponyo, who longs to become human and be with Sosuke. I won&#39;t give you anymore details, you&#39;ll have to see the film for yourself. So overall one of the best animated movies ever made, with plenty of fantasy, adventure, and humor...I loved it!

The thing that&#39;s truly terrifying about this is that the filmmakers thought they were making something intelligent and sexy. Instead they made probably the stupidest horror picture of the year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie starts with a bunch of art snob friends at a gallery. This trashy European weirdo walks up and starts talking pretentious fruitiness to the main character, sounding like he just walked out of an episode of Dark Shadows. He then offers her up some stick to smoke(yes, a freakin&#39; stick), which she eagerly agrees! He picks off some red crap and puts it in a spoon for her to freebase! If this ever happens to you in real life, don&#39;t do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#39;s transported to some weird wannabe Jean Rollin netherworld that&#39;s supposed to be sexy but isn&#39;t, where there&#39;s this thing that looks like a rotted creature from the black lagoon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon she turns all her artsy sleazeball friends onto her new form of supernatural crack. No matter how much these idiots freak out and turn blue they can&#39;t leave it the hell alone. At one point she even makes out with the rotten creature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the final battle and the stupid woman is vaporized or whatever, the so called hero is left alone to pack up his copy of Michael Moore&#39;s Dude Where&#39;s My Country and can&#39;t resist smoking that stick one more time to try to rescue his moron lady friend. What a dope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rates four stars for sheer unintentional humor.

Despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes. Where were the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? Not on the payroll apparently. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes. In a later conversation she said, &#34;Imagine a Finnish director making a movie in Fnnish about the American Civil War using blond Swedish actors as union Army and Frenchmen as the Confederates. Worse imagine dressing the Scarlet O&#39;Hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950&#39;s hairdo. Maybe some people in Finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was &#34;missing the hoop&#34; or recognize the bizarre Jane Mansfield hair, but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears....and be laughing in the aisles...excellent story and photography be damned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...watching Memoirs of a Geisha was painful for anyone familiar with Japanese cultural nuances, actual geisha or Japanese dress, and that was the topic of the movie! Hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making. They frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong. I thought &#34;The Last Samurai&#34; was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on Japan could be. Memoirs of a Geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time.

This cheap, grainy-filmed Italian flick is about a couple of inheritors of a manor in the Italian countryside who head up to the house to stay, and then find themselves getting killed off by ghosts of people killed in that house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#39;t impressed by this. It wasn&#39;t really that scary, mostly just the way a cheap Italian film should be. A girl, her two cousins, and one cousin&#39;s girlfriend, head to this huge house for some reason (I couldn&#39;t figure out why) and are staying there, cleaning up and checking out the place. Characters come in and out of the film, and it&#39;s quite boring at points, and the majority of deaths are quite rushed. The girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death, and the scene is quite good, but then things get slow again, until a confusing end, when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way, and this weirdo guy (I couldn&#39;t figure out who he was during the movie, or maybe I just don&#39;t remember) goes after this one girl, attacking her, until finally this other girl kills him off. Hate to give away the ending, but oh well. The female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it, and they show scenes of her living there years later. The end. You really aren&#39;t missing anything, and anyway, you probably won&#39;t find this anywhere, so lucky you.

This movie makes several mistakes. a few American actors in Spain , and the Spanish actors speaking English. the &#39;spaniards&#39; English is OK, but the way the acting is performed it makes it all quite annoying. the dialog through the whole script is very weak; it may have been a Spanish script but translated incorrectly, who knows and who cares. i can only assume that these are famous Spanish actors forced into the English language , they may be good, but not in this flop. you will figure out the movie within the first 5 minutes, thats how pathetic it is. then the rest is just bad . lots of waste of time, lots of UN-necessary plots. Oh did i mention one of the Baldwins&#39; is in this.

Ahhhh, 1984.... I was young and stupid, and just developing a taste for those exotic cigarettes, whilst living in a squat in Manchester&#39;s Moss Side, with the most unbelievable case of cockroach infestation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few of those doobies, this show was ROTFLMAO material - I was an avid fan. Then I&#39;d look down at the floor (or up at the walls, or just about anywhere) and see my very own collection of &#34;little armadillos&#34; scuttling about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it was the chemical enhancement, but I remember thinking at the time that the overt surrealism of the show was fantastic - it was my second favourite thing on TV at the time (#1 was the season of Luis Bunuel movies being shown by Channel 4). Radical art lives on! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also you gotta that theme tune! ....I swear, I&#39;ll never drink no more....

In the spirit of the Great Space Coaster, but a few years earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot Fudge was one of the psychedelic kid&#39;s shows that I grew up on. Seymour was a big, fuzzy, green puppet, with a crescent smile of enormous teeth which nearly split his head, I recall him wearing a variety of Elton John-type shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He &#34;played&#34; piano, and had a Jesus looking dude in a white tux, sitting next to him. They would have a moral discussion and then do a song about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t remember much else except the opening theme, Seymour and the Hippie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one else I know remembers it at all. I grew up in Jersey, so if it was produced in Detroit as a previous post said, it wasn&#39;t just local. Seymour reminded me a lot of Sherlock the Squirrel from the Magic Garden (another psychedelic kids show if there ever was one.) People always talk about LSD&#39;s effects of music and movies of the 70s, but it seems kid&#39;s show writers got a dose as well.

The French film &#34;Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte&#34; directed by iconoclast film maker Philippe Harel is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial writer Michel Houellebecq.He has also worked on this film&#39;s scenario.According to British cinema magazine Sight and Sound,it is also known as &#34;Whatever&#34;.This film has been hailed as a breath of fresh air for French cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politics and its implications on two stupid information technology workers.The film is marred by its much too evident voice over which introduces us to the main character.This makes us viewers feel as if we are watching a book that is bring read. The basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine but the film goes out of hand once the hero starts recounting the misery faced by him and his friend.Instead of sticking to its main topic the film veers in other directions leading to its downfall.Beware:some women viewers might find not only the film but even its two heroes as moronic misogynists.

This is one of those strange, self-important, self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. It isn&#39;t. Instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene where Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc. during Adam&#39;s travels through the Mojave Desert on foot. (He abruptly leaves L.A. the day of his wedding and his family, friends, and fiance assume he&#39;s dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket.) Some characters are more entertaining than others. The best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, does some great impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye, and several characters from the original Star Trek. But once the interesting characters leave the screen, we&#39;re stuck with Adam again and his pursuit of the profound. It&#39;s a long trip, which drags in many places. In fact, it&#39;s the longest hour and a half movie I&#39;ve ever seen. And the finale hardly makes it seem worth while, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered this movie playing on HBO one day by waking up too early and clicking on the TV. That&#39;ll learn me. Next time I&#39;ll try harder to sleep in.

When I first started watching this movie I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train. The interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring. Its not that I don&#39;t get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact, it&#39;s just that in this film they are very boring. If you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships you&#39;d be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you. It is realistic but you wouldn&#39;t go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie.

Director/lead Larry Bishop tried way, way too hard with Hell Ride. The movie wants to be edgy, witty, provocative, outlandish, biting all of this, seemingly in a Quentin Tarantino/Rob Zombie style. But it&#39;s not edgy. The references seem forced. The dialog tries to be clever and fails. The humor is never funny. Nice try setting a gritty tone but we&#39;d have to care about the characters or the story for it to remotely succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you&#39;re left with are cool Harleys and pretty girls surrounding a bunch of tired, old and out of shape &#34;bad boys&#34; in what looks like an attempt to do a modernized Sergio Leone western. If this movie can make newer generations interested in 60s and 70s films, kudos for it. But on its own, it is rather boring and irrelevant. I do believe there is a place for style over substance. But this movie is not it.

I am a big fan of bad horrors, cheap horrors, b movies, and all that bottom 100 movies, and I do not deny those are the worst stuff ever to enter the big screen, or even your home video for that matter. Some of them, e.g. the infamous Manos The Hands of Fate, are truly bad, and watching them, especially on your own without any friends and beer around, is a torture for a good cinema taste. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;La Momia Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano, however, was not that bad. Well, of course it&#39;s BAD - it&#39;s silly, dated, corny, cheap, etc., there&#39;s an Aztec mummy, a tin robot, a fat masked villain, a mad scientist, Mexican mobsters, etc. the montage is poor, the lines, well, let&#39;s say the lines are not theatrical, the FX and SFX are the best what the Mexican low budget production could&#39;ve offered, etc. etc. Still, the movie is FUN. it&#39;s so bad it makes you laugh cheerfully for an hour time. Sure it depends on one&#39;s sense of humor, however I&#39;m pretty sure La Momia should teach any newcomers to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it. Please note: the movie lasts for about an hour, and I think it&#39;s just enough time of silliness one is able to easily digest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s also another thing - watching La Momia can give you a clue what was the whole SF/Horror genre concept back in the fifties, when you compare it to the present day Matrix era of cinema entertainment. I think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved, due to the fact the watches like La Momia still attract full house in the theaters for some special shows (movies like this are special alright), and very often receive a standing ovation.

I have looked forward to seeing this since I first saw it listed in her work. Finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Larson&#39;s comments about it being a &#34;sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths&#34; were dead on. Writers probably shouldn&#39;t get a bonus, everyone else SRO for making the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD SEE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natasha&#39;s screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric, to say nothing of her beauty, that anything she is in goes on my favorite list. Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God Bless her, her family and future endeavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie doesn&#39;t seem to available in DVD or video yet, but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would too.

&#34;Kings and Queen&#34; is a bloated French drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty-two minutes to no discernible point or purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie. The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life, including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live. The other story involves a young man named Ismael, a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly, he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party. After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that Ismael is a former lover of Nora&#39;s and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier, tragic relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining, &#34;Kings and Queen&#34; might have been a potent, engrossing drama about modern day relationships. It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power, and the performances are, for the most part, complex and touching. But, taken as a whole, the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that, quite frankly, it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on. Even more distressing is the fact that, even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people, we really don&#39;t know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over. For instance, Nora&#39;s father, on his deathbed, writes a withering diatribe against his daughter&#39;s character that simply doesn&#39;t gibe with the woman we&#39;ve been looking at for well over two hours. Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa (then, again, who is?), but she certainly doesn&#39;t deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father. Nora could be accused of being confused, indecisive, a bit self-absorbed at times, but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place? I don&#39;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom. But my suspicion is that even writer Roger Bohbot and co-writer/director Arnaud Desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here. This is a well acted, pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long, rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises, a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning.

The trailer for this movie didn&#39;t do the movie justice. And while the movie didn&#39;t know what it really wanted to get across, the first half of the movie being a light, romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than I thought it would be. This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I&#39;m biased, but this movie proved to be a light, sensitive, if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better. Three out of four stars. 9/5/02.

It is no surprise that writer/director Michael Powell considered &#34;A Matter of Life and Death,&#34; his and Emeric Pressburger&#39;s spellbinding fantasy from 1946 to be his favourite of their films together. Released during the aftermath of World War 2, this colourful romantic adventure would have provided just the tonic for a traumatised, recovering nation in need of a good uplift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following a string of other patriotic war films, &#39;The Archers&#39; made this one their quirkiest, skittish and most patriotic of the lot. Quintessentially British for upholding British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, good manners), it is also visibly Americanised in its baroque compositions, technical inventiveness and a fine multi-ethnic cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly echoing another 1946 classic, &#34;It&#39;s a Wonderful Life,&#34; AMOLAD opens on a grand firmament, with one of those jolly voice-overs preaching about the earth and the heavens, and what a big, wonderful world we live in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It then cuts to the inside of a British cockpit, badly hit, up in flames and with the co-pilot already dead. It sounds misconceived, but the connection is soon made lucid with the events that follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clocking in at nearly 5 minutes, the rapid-fire exchange between British pilot Peter (David Niven) and American radio contact June (Kim Hunter) is breathtaking in its intimacy. Resigned to dying, Peter nevertheless exhausts plenty of vigour, charm and outpouring confessions, and his warm affiliation with June closes with a mutual exchange of &#39;I love you.&#39; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping with the magic of the moment, Peter, by oversight of his Conductor 71 whose job it was to transport him to the &#39;Other World,&#39; escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach. He later encounters June riding a bicycle, and instantly matches the body with the voice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But realising their error, the high court want Peter sent back, and order the French Conductor (Maurice Goring) down to earth to retrieve him. But Peter is adamant to live because of June and the Conductor&#39;s mistake, and wilfully guards his corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter&#39;s fate ultimately lies with the heavenly court and American prosecutor (Raymond Massey), whose jury consists of several deceased war heroes and posh British delegates. The surreal trial, which dissolves from b/w back into rich Technicolor, once the verdict is announced, may well be a dream, but the final shot in the hospital validates the predictable outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The abstract, frame filling &#34;stairway to heaven&#34; (the American title of the film) is used twice: the first time in b/w, when it elevates Peter and his enigmatic French guardian upwards, crossing giant statues of Peter&#39;s potential attorneys for the trial, including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second time, the softly lit colour stairway provides the setting for what is an iconic image in cinema - Peter and June frozen side-by-side, their marvelled eyes fixed forward in the frame, their fate sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unlikely affection shared between Peter and June never turns mushy or verbose; it&#39;s treated with nobility and the perception that the couple are already suitable enough to be married and simply need to convince people of their love, so it can keep them together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The French Conductor, who can freeze time and people&#39;s bodies, obtrudes many of their key moments together, lecturing Peter about history and among his mischievous tricks, pinching Peter&#39;s &#39;Top 100 Game Tricks&#39; book and his coffee cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As visually inspired as other Powell/Pressburger collaborations, this was the first time they combined colour with b/w  the latter having a cheerful quality when used for the heaven scenes, and both are equally captivating. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outstanding script more than matches the imaginative set design, with dialogue that sounds so immediate that is doesn&#39;t feel like it was written or performed for the screen. Amusing and witty, Powell/Pressburger&#39;s writing deserves equal acclamation with their forte for colour and composition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in 1946, &#34;A Matter of Life and Death&#34; is one of those films that defies it age, looking fresh and inventive, even in this age where CGI would vamp up its artificial effects, probably stripping them of their emotional wonder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other jarring changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for cutting and the inevitable plea to shorten dialogue so it can preserve the low attention spans of most audiences. Powell weaves a spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame, giving him freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of Peter&#39;s predicament.

The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell is really good film. It has good acting by the cast including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong.The music is spooky and gives that devilish chill!I liked the effects on the dog and I think the creature itself looked really cool with its horns,frill like part on his neck, and acted really viscous!If you like horror films and haven&#39;t seen The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell before and are able to find and buy this rare film then do so because its a good movie and I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be disappointed!

Well, the movie isn&#39;t exactly &#34;funny.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I admit, there are a few HUMOROUS lines, but definitely nothing that is laugh-out-loud funny. For example: Right before a steamy sex scene between Eleniak and one of her male costars, sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt. Before leaving the room to retrieve the key, he tells her, &#34;Okay, don&#39;t go anywhere.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, humorous, but not funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot and acting are pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. She&#39;s hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one can&#39;t help but rewind and re-watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 5 stars. I&#39;d only give it three if not for Erika Eleniak.

The production year says it all. The movie is a marauding mess of politically correct leftwing feministic selfappreciating drivel, of a so heavyhanded symbolic variety that comes across as ridiculous today. Every scene has the purpose of shedding light on one of the burning issues of society, mainly the role of females in the working community, the role of women vs men, women as sex objects, consumerism, politics, war, etc. Every scene is commented upon by the inner dialogue of one of the main actresses, or by turning the scene into a surrealistic joke. I have no reminiscence of any plot, or who the main characters actually were. It is the sort of movie, where consumerism is mocked by having a couple make love in a furniture store sales window while the sales agent delivers his speech, or where a revealing interview of a stage actress turns into a fullblown striptease act, for &#34;of course&#34; the offensive gentlemen of the press is the equal to a raunchy club audience. Then we move swiftly on, as we need to see war erupt in a peaceful forest, we need to see multiple inflammatory feministic public speeches being drowned in the (male) blowing of cars horns or rioting crowds, and of course we need to see cinema newsreels of Stalin and all the other usual suspects. You get the idea. But all this does not matter at all. The movie is an unsurpassed piece of eyecandy for any (male) Ingmar Bergman aficionado. A movie boasting leads Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom at the height of their beauty makes this reviewer surrender completely and just drivel  and also delight in watching them so generously use their acting skills in a movie I had never heard about before today. It is hard to believe how especially the face of Bibi Andersson owns the screen every single time she appears. The cinematography is gorgeously orchestrated bw, often revelling in an overexposed (?) dimensionless whitishness, and you just never grow tired of watching the performers. How absurd, that a movie made with so much consideration for the feministic agenda, tirelessly advocating that women should not be viewed as merely an object of desire, has nothing better to offer the 21st century viewer than a parade of stunningly beautiful babes. As mentioned, I am not complaining. I could rewatch it tomorrow.

Carrot Top&#39;s &#34;Chairman of the Board&#34; and his AT&amp;T commercials are living proof that fly-blown fecal matter is available in the color orange. Not FREELY available, however, as HBO charges for such garbage. Blehhh! The saving grace of COTB is that it surely fills suicide hot-lines across the country, perhaps providing employment for thousands of telephone therapists who lost their jobs when recovered memory treatment was discredited, although (sadly) Carrot Top probably contributes to his sponsor AT&amp;T&#39;s bottom line with the increased phone traffic from devastated HBO viewers. I can visualize the hordes of traumatized TV viewers, phone in one hand and fully loaded .45 auto in the other hand, dialing out of last-minute desperation before walking off the plank of life to escape the specter of COTB&#39;s orange-haired monster echoing in their synapses like the agony of searing, irreversible meningeal swelling.

How LIVING THE DREAM managed to get into the Laemmle 5 in West Hollywood is beyond me, as it is the worst film I have ever seen in my life. I should have known when the first scene opened in-gasp, Eugene, Oregon-,that this dud of a film with characters that you want to like and feel sorry for from their exclusion days from high school,but can&#39;t, as they are such losers, is so wooden and atrocious with dialog that is beyond bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, cliché, the three high school losers end up in LA, and here is where the film could have been realistic if it had shown them trying to find a career in acting. But no, one works as a used car salesman, the other is a true loser in a garage call center selling magazines. Even the bastard that runs the place has more audience appeal than that dreadful actor with the horrible foreign accent. And, they fraudulently get money from an insurance scam to set up an Executive Recruitment firm with no experience, just showing &#34;the supposed good life&#34; in LA night spots with a cast of actors that are so wooden and bad, they better not have SAG cards...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on about this bad film, but I ended up walking out of the theater, which had at the start six people, and when I left four men were the only ones in the audience. I wanted to like this film, but I couldn&#39;t find one merit in the story, characters, writing, dialog, nor the actors. Whoever cast this film should retire. Amen...enough...

Look it&#39;s Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend. It&#39;s Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives and the guy who wore &#34;sex Panther cologne&#34; in Anchorman. If you are expecting a Golden Globe nominated movie then you need to rethink how you look at movies. However, if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you&#39;ve come to the right place. The characters are all funny. They work together very well. The real match up is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He&#39;s as funny as he was on Friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time. I went with my wife, she enjoyed it and so did I.

This film is the most traumatising and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life. To know that this film is based on a true story and watching Jeffrey Dahmer(Carl Crew) brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye. I admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue, however it explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a Psycotic maniac. As he was so selfishly/inwardly emotional his emotions and selfishness went so far deep into his brain that it resulted into him becoming a murderer. Every person that he lured back to his apartment, he was attracted to and had feelings for, and the reasons why he murdered them wasn&#39;t only for the thrill of killing them but because he couldn&#39;t cope with the fact of them leaving him. In the scene when he killed his first victim by bashing an object at the back of the guys head from what I noticed wasn&#39;t because he wanted to kill him but because he was devastated with the idea of the guy leaving him. It was from thereafter that he got use to the homicidal behaviour and made killing his hobby - for both evil and emotional reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scene when he was talking while crying on the phone with his mother and telling her how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he didn&#39;t want to move out of her house did show that he did have love in his heart. One scene that I found quite spooky and strange was when a priest overheard Jeffrey in a pub inviting a guy back to his apartment and then phoned Jeffrey up in a phone booth within the pub so that the guy would lose patience and change his mind on going home with Jeffrey. When the guy left the pub, the priest then hung up the phone and was was laughing at Jeffrey. I also found that Carl Crew played a remarkable acting performance as the role of Jeffrey Dahmer. His evil and cold blooded facial expressions before he massacred his victims were so real, I was shivering in my seat. His facial expressions reminded me of the way Vincent D&#39;onofrio (Private Pyle/Leonard) in the film &#39;Full Metal Jacket&#39; looked just before he gunned-down the General in the toilet barracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your an emotional person I wouldn&#39;t recommend you to watch this film but if your not, than go ahead and watch it.

I, having both read and watched Gone With The Wind, found it very difficult to not compare this movie with the original. Although I thought Scarlett, the novel, was superb, the movie didn&#39;t add up. It was a completely different story. Of course, there will never be another Scarlett and Rhett besides Leigh and Gable, but the new actors did a fine job, considering. I loved the way the book and movie wrapped up the story of Gon With the Wind, because after reading it I felt a surge of disappointment because it just stopped and left the readers to wonder what happened. Scarlett finishes the story very well, and Alexandra Ripley did great on the book. I just wish the movie followed the story more, although it is great in itself.

Very well done acting and directing. This is a cross between &#34;The Last Don&#34; and &#34; Godfather 2&#34;.One large plus for this production is that it is claimed to be a true story of Joseph Bonanno. With a better music score to create mood, it could have been a rival for both Godfather movies.

Well, maybe I&#39;m just having a bad run with Hindi movies lately. I asked the video store guy for Apharan (Prakash Jha) but being a new release, wasn&#39;t available yet. So I had to settle for this one. It turned out to be the stupidest Hindi movie I&#39;ve seen (and I&#39;ve seen quite a few). No wonder BOllywood is the laughing stock of the whole world! If IMDb had negative ratings, I would give Garam Masala a -10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember seeing a TV show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in Mumbai. All the usual celebs and their sideys showed up. For some strange reason, people expect good stuff from Piyadarashan. I did not like Hulchul, Hungama, or his other films. Hulchul, probably dubbed from Tamil or Telugu, came across as very loud, in-your-face fare that again didn&#39;t make much sense except in a Bollywood flick. This latest piece of utter CXXP proved that this guy has NO BRAINS. Who made him a director, even a Bollywood director at that??? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, to the film now. What starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a non-sensical woman-hunt. Two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment (isn&#39;t it similar to No Entry where the 2 dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office? Jezuz Christ, now they&#39;re copying their own stories!) Well anyways, there&#39;s some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multi-lateral love (aka multi-tasking + multi-timing). What happened in the end, I&#39;ve no idea. I switched off mid-way. What ridiculous junk. I can&#39;t believe they even released it. And how sadistic to wallow in their own filth! For which audience did they make it - the poor illiterate Indian masses (700 Mil at last count) or the well-heeled NRI desis staying in Phoren? Either ways it doesn&#39;t matter. Neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such god-awful stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a short review because there&#39;s nothing to write about but the usual bag of F-grade garbage. Bollywood should change its name to Follywood. And yes, this review is much better than the movie itself.

For those fans of Laurel and Hardy, the 1940s and beyond were a very sad time for the team. Their contracts with Hal Roach Studios had expired and now they were &#34;free agents&#34;--able to work for any studio who offered them a job. Unfortunately, Fox, RKO, MGM (without Roach) and even a French film company who hired the boys had absolutely no touch for their comedic talents. Plus, Stan and Ollie were a lot older and seeing these geriatric men taking pratfalls seemed sad, not particularly funny. Stan looked very ragged and Ollie&#39;s weight had ballooned up to the point where he could barely walk--and so it made me feel uncomfortable laughing at their very, very sedate antics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to their age, this particular film suffers because Fox Studios oddly cast them in a supporting role and created a parallel plot involving a young couple--something that reduced their time on screen AND turned them into insipid &#34;hangers on&#34; instead of just being themselves. A cute and cuddly Stan and Ollie is very foreign to the old Laurel and Hardy of the 20s and 30s--and just seemed awfully strange and suited them poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now even with their age, this COULD have been a decent movie if it had been given decent writing and if it appeared the studio cared--and it&#39;s quite obvious they were using the &#34;B unit&#34; here--with, at best, second class support. In particular, there are very few laughs and the last 10 minutes of the film is simply dreadful--relying exclusively on a sloppy rear-projected screen for the stupid chase scene--which might just rank as one of the worst of its kind in film history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For mind-numbed zombie lovers of Laurel and Hardy, it&#39;s probably a film they will love. But, for lovers of the team who are willing to honestly evaluate this film relative to their amazing earlier films, it simply comes up wanting indeed. In fact, of all their full-length films pre-1940, I can&#39;t think of one I liked less than DANCING MASTERS. Unfortunately, of the post-1940 films, this might just be one of their better ones. Sadly, it got a lot worse--with wretched films like THE BIG NOISE and NOTHING BUT TROUBLE. I just wish the boys had just retired after SAPS AT SEA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I wonder if all the generally positive reviews for this film on IMDb might reflect the reviewers&#39; love of the team more than it&#39;s an indication that this is a good film? For an audience who are NOT already in love with the team, I don&#39;t know HOW this film will do anything but bore the audience--it certainly WON&#39;T convince anyone that Laurel and Hardy were comedic geniuses. But even comedic geniuses need material worthy of their talents.

I saw this film in the worst possible circumstance. I&#39;d already missed 15 minutes when I woke up to it on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I didn&#39;t know what I was watching, I thought maybe it was a movie of the week, but quickly became riveted by the performance of the lead actress playing a young woman who&#39;s child had been kidnapped. The premise started taking twist and turns I didn&#39;t see coming and by the end credits I was scrambling through the the in-flight guide to figure out what I had just watched. Turns out I was belatedly discovering Do-yeon Jeon who&#39;d won Best Actress at Cannes for the role. I don&#39;t know if Secret Sunshine is typical of Korean cinema but I&#39;m off to the DVD store to discover more.

If you&#39;re a layman interested in quantum theory and string theory, read &#34;The Elegant Universe&#34; by Brian Greene of Columbia University, and &#34;The Universe in a Nutshell&#34; by Stephen Hawking of Cambridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recipe for #$*!:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 parts bombastic New Age pontificator, 2 parts pseudoscientist, 2 parts real scientist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix together until ingredients are indistinguishable from each other and spread on celluloid thin enough that there is no discernible substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serving suggestion: barf bags.

I recall so many things about seeing this movie back during it&#39;s original theatrical release - the post Woodstock afterglow of peace and love, along with the pre-Watergate tension of fear and paranoia. It&#39;s hard to believe that it&#39;s thirty seven years later, and I can still remember the thoughts going through my head while watching the film with my best friend. Like marveling at Peter Boyle&#39;s characterization of the ultimate redneck, sure to typecast him the rest of his career (Oh, how wrong!), and how the counter culture jarred the sensibilities of most of the country. To this day, my buddy and I still use Joe Curran&#39;s line from my summary above when faced with a dilemma; curious how a simple line like that can stay with you for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s curious to read comments about the film from others on this board, particularly the ones stating that the film has a dated quality and how over the top the characters were. Still, if you were around during that time, the picture gives a pretty accurate portrayal of the polar opposites that existed back then, pretty much side by side as the events in the story reveal. If you really want dated, when was the last time you heard the words Macy&#39;s and Gimbel&#39;s in the same sentence, or a line like Joe&#39;s - &#34;Come on, get with the Pepsi generation&#34;. For historical perspective, you have that great Nixon poster lingering in one of the background scenes - &#34;Would you buy a used car from this man?&#34; With minor intricacies like those, director John Avildsen captures many of the subtle but ever present hints of how life was four decades ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today&#39;s viewing was only the second time I&#39;ve seen the movie, and I have to admit I don&#39;t remember Susan Sarandon in one of the lead roles, but then again, this was her very first picture. The scenes of nudity and free love were something actually quite new and bold at the time, shocking in fact, as film makers began to experiment with their ability to push the envelope of propriety and convention. &#34;Joe&#34; took a major leap in that regard, particularly since it was a &#39;mainstream&#39; picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the passage of time, the thing that impresses me the most about Peter Boyle was how he overcame the stereotype of Joe Curran to appear in or star in some of my very favorite pieces of work. I mean, how do you go from &#34;Joe&#34; to that hilarious rendition of &#39;Puttin&#39; on the Ritz&#39; in &#34;Young Frankenstein&#34;? And my absolute favorite episode of &#39;X-Files&#39; has Boyle as Clyde Bruckman, in both a tender and tragic, funny and serious portrayal that turns the tables on Scully and Mulder more than once. And as a career capper, Frank Barone has to be one of the funniest characters in the history of television. Even repeat episodes in syndication are funny as he-- whenever the elder Barone lets loose with one of his observations. He is one actor that this viewer sorely misses already.

If movies like Ghoulies rip off Gremlins, then Hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like Ghoulies. These barely-animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies (which involve basically groteque characters&#39; sex dreams - oh joy), but what that has to do with anything is anybody&#39;s guess, except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica. They show this down in the 8th circle of Hell, one suspects. There&#39;s no real plot - just &#34;goblins - kill!&#34; and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience.

What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of what talent there was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emilio Estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused throughout. Jon Lovitz was very mildly amusing but pointless. Harry Dean Stanton - why bother? And was it just me or can Kari Wuhrer barely act in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story was pretty non-existent and really disjointed. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that transpired. Like the surf &#34;dudes&#34; giving up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half? How about that you NEVER saw them surf once!! The set-up to some scenes took way to long with not enough pay-off to make us give a damn. Nothing in this &#34;movie&#34; felt really true or genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good things I can say is some (very little) of the scenery was filmed nicely and a few scenes were mildly interesting. Don&#39;t see this when there is so many better pointless movies out there.

While studying the differences between religion and cult in college, Mindy (Rachel Miner), who is the best student in the class, convinces her schoolmates Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel Michaely) and Morgan (Victoria Venegas) to research the massacre of worshipers of Kwan Yin by their leader Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) twenty years ago in California. Quinlin had found an ancient amulet in Southern China that would give an enormous power to him after the sacrifice of human souls, but one woman resists and he is destroyed. However, after the death of Morgan, who apparently committed suicide, the students discover that Quinlin has returned and is chasing their souls with his amulet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storyline of &#39;Cult&#34; is not totally bad. Unfortunately, the screenplay, the direction, the acting, the lines, the camera, the CGI and the edition are awful. I was completely bored and tempted to use the FF button of the DVD, but I resisted and wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this never-ending crap on a Saturday night. My vote is two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;O Amuleto Secreto&#34; (&#34;The Secret Charm&#34;)

&#34;Pink Flamingos&#34; was revolutionary for its time, and even today it&#39;s still hard to watch. Not that I didn&#39;t enjoy the film, it&#39;s hilarious; but it&#39;s very repulsive and Jonh Waters pushes the envelope as far as it can go. The story concerns Babs Johnson (Devine), she&#39;s the filthiest women alive. She lives in a trailer with her son Crackers and daughter Cotton. Not to mention the overweight Edie who&#39;s obsessed with eggs and sleeps in a crib. Then there&#39;s Connie and Raymond Marble, two filthy perverts who are jealous of Babs. They long to outdo her in being the filthiest person alive. This means having their janitor impregnate kidnapped women and selling the babies to lesbian couples, flashing people in public, and even sending Babs a turd in the mail. Babs fights back to prove she&#39;s the most deranged person alive. Which even includes incest, murder and eating dog crap and other sick sexual acts. It&#39;s a film that&#39;s fun for the whole family. (well depending on where you live?) Watch &#34;Pink Flamingos&#34;, but don&#39;t forget your barf bag. For more perverse, weird sex and bodily functions also see &#34;Sweet Movie&#34;.

This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;quirky&#34; and obnoxious characters (a few); &#34;quirky&#34; town with &#34;quirky&#34; folk; a &#34;quirky&#34; coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of &#34;gotta get out of this town&#34;; downright booooring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it succeeds on all counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to note, though. I couldn&#39;t figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-Northern Exposure &#34;quirky&#34; comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. The editing of this movie jumped around nonsensically from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation. Not to mention the fact that half the time we didn&#39;t even know where we were jumping. Take for instance, the very opening shots, of yelling teens in a car. Who are they and what the h--- did they have to do with anything? And this sub - uh - plot (use that word plot loosely) concering kids that seem to span generations. I don&#39;t think they actually do, but the editing makes it look like they materialize from flashback, all of a sudden, to current time. Huh? What did I miss?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid. Unless for laughs. Or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing.

A genuinely odd, surreal jumble of visual ideas which probably looked extremely puzzling on the printed page; just what drew Robert Redford to the project, one may never know. Sidney J. Furie directs this knockabout journey of an egotistical motorcycle racer taking a milquetoast juvenile under his wing; the kid looks up to this anti-hero, and eventually begins to ape his amorality. Disjointed and off-putting--though for some, the sight of Redford disrobing, about to disrobe, or having been disrobed might be enough to warrant attention. Lauren Hutton gets naked too, however all the sexy flashes are just teasers for the prurient-minded; there simply is no story. Perhaps Furie was making an esoteric comment about feckless wheelers and their flock circa 1970. If true, then this pre-Blank Generation approach backfired, as the film was not a success. *1/2 from ****

I saw this movie years ago and I never forgot it. The theme is very timely. It was on TCM this morning and I am wondering why this wonderful film is not on VHS or DVD. I have searched extensively for this movie but cannot find it. I believe that if enough people request it, the movie will ultimately be put on DVD. It amazes me that such a stunning performance from Quinn and such a powerful plot is not yet available to the public. The fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must see for teachers and students alike. This film is a great teaching tool from the past yet in many ways as contemporary as &#34;Crash&#34;. From previous comments I can see that this film as made deep impressions on everyone. Again, too bad it is not available for sale.

This was a very enjoyable film. A humorous, but poignant look at family, and the obligations that come with it. The story of a man who comes home from his life in the city to his fathers bath house in a small Chinese village. There he learns to appreciate, even cherish the very things he left home to get away from. The film is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful.

I recently watched this film at the 30&#39;Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was on of the worst films I&#39;ve ever had the misfortune to watch. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining bad films (e.g &#34;Manos  Hands of fate&#34;) and then there are the awful bad films. (This one falls into the latter category). The cinematography was unbelievable, and not in a good way. It felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot), the lighting was something between &#34;one guy running around with a light bulb&#34; and &#34;non existing&#34;. The actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors, and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them. The only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer, a classic look a la Jason Vorhees from &#34;Friday the 13&#39;Th&#34;. The Plot was extremely poor, and the ending even worse. I would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like, or maybe an insomniac needing sleep.

At first I wasn&#39;t sure if I wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so I looked it up on IMDb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so I thought I would give it a try expecting a movie like Elephant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got past the fact that I am supposed to dislike the Alicia character played excellently by Busy Phillips, I realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between Alicia and Deanna. Alicia is so mean to Deanna played by Erika Christensen almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting. They share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve just got to say how much I loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it. I couldn&#39;t even get through Elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the Columbine tragedy. This movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic. Busy Phillips acting is OFF the CHAIN!!! That is a good thing and I would love to see her progress into some more mature roles.

It has very little to do with the books: half of the characters have been eliminated, the plot has been greatly altered, people&#39;s parents are changed for different characters . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you watch it as an independent piece (try and forget you ever read the books) the movie is very well put together, everyone is very good looking, and there is even a sweet ending...

This is a thriller with a good concept, good acting, good photography and good intentions all around, but which is confused and disjointed in execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garcia stars as John Berlin, an L.A. forensic detective who has moved to a small California town at the behest of a friend of his on the force there. He soon becomes involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder which leads to his theorizing about the existence of a serial killer whom no one else believes in. The known victim is theorized to be blind, which leads to a romance with a blind girl - believed to be a witness - at a nearby school for the blind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite a basically intriguing story there were too many quantum leaps and plot holes in this movie where I found myself wondering, &#39;how the hell did we wind up here?&#39; or &#39;how did we find this out?&#39; I found it confusing and disjointed, despite the good acting, etc. John Malkovich has a small part toward the end as an F.B.I. investigator out to get Berlin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.

The premise to this movie was one which focused on the polarization of of ideologies in the United States.. This was a highly combustible scenario in America whereby two entirely different cultures collided. What justified such heinously depraved actions anyway?.. As this film presents the scene,(while Hickock and Smith drank) these two men were not intoxicated, nor were they under any kind of influence of drugs!! It was a clear cut case of cold and calculated deliberation.. Basically, these violent acts were the end result of emotional and social neglect... Anytime past 1975, we as a nation have nurtured an empathy for deviates who have been victimized by their environment... However, this incident takes place in 1959!! This dreadful revelation sideswiped us, and mired the nation into a tailspin of conflicting ethics!! With the recent release of the movie &#34;Capote&#34; based on Truman Capote, who was the creator of the documentary &#34;In Cold Blood&#34;, the American people have cultivated a new found fascination with this film!! Robert Blake played the role of Perry Smith, one of the villains in this movie... This is seemingly appropriate given the notoriety he has been involved with concerning his personal life!! &#34;In Cold Blood&#34; centers on the element of the unexplained... There was no vengeance involved, there was no material gain to be acquired, there was no potential for social advancement here either, this is merely an instance of a latent and insidiously belligerent anger which ends certainly did not justify the means!! The situational diatribes which Hickock and Smith lamented about were always ambiguous!! Under the circumstances, why then should they take their frustrations out on an anonymously unsuspecting and innocent Kansas family?.. Will Geer (Grandpa Walton) plays the prosecuting attorney who is sickened by this act of macabre capriciousness!! His argument is thoroughly convincing... His contention being: &#34;These two men who demonstrated no mercy are now asking for yours&#34; This is a line of logic which would induce me to render a verdict of a conviction if I were to be one of the members of the jury!! Absolute disdain for your precarious plight in life does not serve as vindication for orchestrating a capital crime!! It was Capote&#39;s instincts that dictated that such a deranged act of violence should have been brought to the American public&#39;s attention!! As it turn out, it was a harbinger of things to come.. &#34;In Cold Blood&#34; did just that!! This incident was the calm before the storm relating to a pertinent aspect of emergence to the radical 1960&#39;s!! Such a lethal charade also served as an insight to the isolated interests which would besiege many typical Americans for the future!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truman Capote does a tremendous job on authenticating this savage occurrence with his book, (which was a best seller) and, with this documentary as well... The acting in this film by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as well as people like John Forsythe, was incredible!! The director, Richard Brooks, (&#34;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&#34;, &#34;Blackboard Jungle&#34; &#34;Elmer Gantry&#34; and &#34;Key Largo&#34; to name but a few!!) was outstanding in his collaborative efforts in this movie!! I think that &#34;In Cold Blood&#34; is one of the best films in the history of movies!! The film depicts two reprehensible spawns of depravity who delved into demented theatrics, and wound up captivating a trite gratification for being acknowledged at a pejorative nationwide level!!.... This movie pinpoints a psychological discontentment which spurs on an emerging bevy of counter culture purveyors of violence!! Our nation&#39;s ideologies are incredibly different now, than they were in 1959!! This movie introduces the American people to the emotional and vacillating culprits who initiated such a precarious metamorphosis in our overall value system!! I recommend to everyone that they see this movie...&#34;In Cold Blood&#34; was the focal point to the film &#34;Capote&#34;! Think about it, making a movie about a movie constitutes a rare and coveted accolade in Hollywood!! In the case of &#34;In Cold Blood&#34; it is an extreme example of a movie which is vicariously clairvoyant, intellectually elevating, and, of course, it goes without saying, &#34;In Cold Blood&#34; was utterly spellbinding, as well as a totally remarkable movie!!

Steve McQueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there. He certainly was a charismatic fellow, one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew. But even McQueen can&#39;t save this turkey of a film, shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in St. Louis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McQueen&#39;s a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang. There&#39;s more than a broad hint that there&#39;s a gay relationship going on between young Steve and David Clarke. He&#39;s not liked at all by the other heist members, mainly because of his lack of criminal resume. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve also has a girl friend in Molly McCarthy and she suspects something afoot, especially when he starts hanging around with Crahan Denton and James Dukas as well as Clarke, all pretty rough characters. That would certainly get my suspicions aroused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery had two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim did mostly documentaries and Stix didn&#39;t do much of anything. One of those two jokers decided Steve&#39;s performance was best served by doing a bad Marlon Brando imitation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film may go down as the worst ever done by Steve McQueen. I&#39;m willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions had already signed him for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can&#39;t believe they would have if they saw this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey.

Zatoichi The Outlaw was the first film made by its hero&#39;s (Shintaro Katsu) own production company, this is perhaps why this is a slightly lesser entry in the series, though it is by no means weak overall. It tells of our hero coming across two towns, rival bosses and a mysterious ronin helping the poor and from this set up spins a tale encompassing tragedy, violence and no little interest, all served up with lashings of the unshowy but inspired swordplay that is one of the series trademarks. It is a fairly predictable plot and it mounts in unsurprising fashion, but it zips along with style and is interesting stuff. The helpful ronin for example is a nobly inscrutable revolutionary character, upsetting the established order without being painted as a truly likable or heroic figure, Zatoichi himself makes one or two mistakes and causes harm by his actions, whilst the ruling system fuels the exploitation of the poor. Its a harsh world, with one or two more visceral than expected moments in the fighting, though things aren&#39;t as rousing as they could be. Shintaro Katsu turns in a typical bravura performance as Zatoichi, mixing wisdom, deadly skill and worldliness with a subtly sad sense of vulnerability, while solid work comes also from Rentarô Mikuni and an effectively baleful Kô Nishimura (later to appear as Katsu&#39;s superior &#34;Snake&#34; Magobei in the Hanzo trilogy) as the two main bosses in the film. There is also a good emotional turn from Yuko Hamada as a wronged woman. The film loses out through shaky pacing and a not so well constructed sequence of events, there is at least one slightly jarring time jump and the power of the plot becomes a little lost, meaning that when things heat up towards the end the film isn&#39;t as exciting as it could be, emotional impact is lost also. The action or scenes of Zatoichi using his ingenious skills are well handled by director Satsuo Yamamoto, though some of the gambling is less interesting and the film builds up in a workmanlike rather than really inspired way, without the lively characters or strong verve of some other installments. Still, I enjoyed this one, it has its flaws and isn&#39;t one of the best of the series but it still packs a sweetly satisfying dose of entertainment, a good story and decent doses of Zatoichi&#39;s trademark ingenious and quirky cool. Recommended for fans of the series, and a reasonable entry point, classy stuff though not a true great.

I just saw a terrible film called The Sleeping Dictionary. One reviewer on Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) got it right right when he wrote, &#34;From A to Zzzzzzzzz.&#34; The story is about an English colonialist jerk that comes to Malaysia to &#34;civilize the savages&#34; so to speak and ends up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary. A sleeping dictionary is a native Malaysian prostitute fluent in English that services Englishmen colonialists and teaches them her native language in return for ... well the movie never really makes that clear, but I can only assume he gives her money or something. Needless to say, the movie focuses a lot more on the &#34;sleeping&#34; part than on the &#34;dictionary&#34; part of the job description. Things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love affair gets compounded by her culture, his soap opera domestic situation, and his own boundless stupidity in every major decision he makes throughout the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, the movie has some major flaws, but on the other hand, it delivered exactly the two things I rented it for in the first place: a beautifully photographed exotic location, and an even more beautifully photographed and exotic woman that plays the sleeping dictionary, Jessica Alba. My friend told me that this crappy movie was her at her most beautiful and damn was he right. She&#39;s not a great actress, and doesn&#39;t quite pass for Malaysian, and its pretty obvious that they use a body double for the nudity, but who cares? Jessica Alba has that rare face and figure that&#39;s more than just sexy, but also beautiful in the way that a Vivaldi violin concerto or a Rembrandt painting is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(P.S. Sorry to all you feminists out there who discourage objectifying women, the &#34;male gaze,&#34; etc. etc., but I hope you can understand that I mean no disrespect.)

I could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable. The dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft-core porn. In this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks. (Perhaps for sex as well, but not on Indian TV, anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not being a fan of the genre I couldn&#39;t place Jeff Wincott, and had no leads to search from. Only once Brigitte Nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif (so mayoral!) for the high-top fade we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II did I make the positive ID on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90&#39;s couture or nod-and-wink schlock à la Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a genre tag for &#34;so-bad-it&#39;s-good&#34;?

I checked out this video expecting to like it. Wanting to like it. I like foreign films, I like beautiful cinematography, I know the critics liked this film (including my favorite, Roger Ebert), and I don&#39;t mind &#34;slow&#34; films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#39;s beautiful. That&#39;s about the best I can say for it. The plot is very thin, the shots are very long, the glances are very meaningful, the actors are very sincere, and it seems like a very long movie. I fell asleep half way though it, woke up, rewound the tape, tried again. It was a trial, but I made it to the end. I didn&#39;t like it any better for that.

***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Well, seeing as I am a major H:LOTS fan, maybe I liked the movie more than normal people would. However, this movie is still excellent. It had tons of surprises, and it gave some more closure to the series. While I was sad that Bayliss turned into a murderer, the overall feeling I felt was satisfied.

This is what we can do to each other. This is the sort that everbody should see at least once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not glorify world. It shows that it is the everyday person who is killed, mained and debased by war. The person on the &#34;other side&#34; eats sleeps, laughs and cry just as we do.

I remember stumbling upon this special while channel-surfing in 1965. I had never heard of Barbra before. When the show was over, I thought &#34;This is probably the best thing on TV I will ever see in my life.&#34; 42 years later, that has held true. There is still nothing so amazing, so honestly astonishing as the talent that was displayed here. You can talk about all the super-stars you want to, this is the most superlative of them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You name it, she can do it. Comedy, pathos, sultry seduction, ballads, Barbra is truly a story-teller. Her ability to pull off anything she attempts is legendary. But this special was made in the beginning, and helped to create the legend that she quickly became. In spite of rising so far in such a short time, she has fulfilled the promise, revealing more of her talents as she went along. But they are all here from the very beginning. You will not be disappointed in viewing this.

&#34;The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film&#34; is not a film as such, but it is a short series of clips with a comical slapstick theme. This &#39;film&#39; got Richard Lester recognised and paved the way for him to direct the first Beatles film: &#39;A Hard Day&#39;s Night&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in 1959. This film was entitled The Running, Jumping, &amp; Standing Still Film. It was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production. Since the film was intended to be viewed by Lester and his partners alone, a small amount of money and time was invested. The sole purpose of this film is entertainment, but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera. The film cost 70£ to make, and it was filmed in sepia-toned film stock in a field on a couple of Sundays. All of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production; the finished production is eleven minutes in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Running, Jumping, &amp; Standing Still Film is a comedy about English Sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time. All of the events in this film take place in a field. A few of these comical events include a woman scrubbing a lawn, a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record, a photographer developing film in a pond, an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a model&#39;s face, a man building a tent, an athlete running over the tent, and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun. Not only does the film poke fun at the hobbies that people do to pass the time away, but it also pokes fun at English culture when compared to American culture. Another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a kite, which has been constructed out of the flag of the United Kingdom. One of the men jumps inside the kite while the other men attempt to fly it, and the kite breaks. According to Neil Sinyard, author of The Films of Richard Lester, this event symbolizes the United Kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the United States during the space age. According to this scene, the British fly primitive kites while the Americans, the world-power after World War II, fly highly-advanced rockets and space shuttles.

I have been getting into the Hitchcock series very much lately. I find myself always renting one of his movies when I&#39;m at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. Like I said before, Hollywood is loosing it&#39;s touch incredibly, I needed a reminder that there are terrific films out there. Not to mention, I want to be a film appreciator, not a movie buff. Is there any better way to do that than with Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s movies? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Man who knew too Much is another great and exciting thriller starring Alfred&#39;s favorite leading man James Stuart and the woman who steals the show Dorris Day. They play husband and wife who go on vacation with their son, but when a spy tells James some information that could arrest another spy, his son is kidnapped and held for ransom. James seems to just doubt Dorris and her ability for ideas on how to get their son back, but she makes a great comeback and just about ends up being the hero of the flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting again, I would say that Dorris was the one who outshined the whole cast. James did a great job keeping up, together these two made you sit down and never budge throughout the film. I loved the little bit of comedy at the end that Alfred added. You&#39;ll see what I mean. I would always highly recommend this film, despite not being the best Hitchcock film, it&#39;s still a treasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10

The main character is a whiny, irresponsible study of how to throw yourself a pity party. She loses it at the drop of a hat, acts pathetic, is schizophrenic, and left me wondering why on Earth she doesn&#39;t understand why these &#39;friends&#39; of hers haven&#39;t called her in three years. (Get a clue, sister - you&#39;re a juvenile mess!) I couldn&#39;t stand her or the friends. I never felt connected to any of the characters. To make the entire movie even more unbearable, someone went far out of their way to put the world&#39;s most hideous collection of crocheted and knitted hats in existence on film for all of eternity (this alone should warrant someone be put on wardrobe probation for a decade!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting wasn&#39;t awful, but not really believable either, and in the end the only thing that I DID care about was the two hours I&#39;m never going to get back. Don&#39;t waste your time - go catch up on a dentist appointment instead!

What can have been on Irene Dunne&#39;s mind when she accepted the role in this distasteful account of a woman of negotiable morals? Certainly, the Irene Dunne of the 1940&#39;s, whose reputation as a faithful Roman Catholic who publicly abhorred smut, and shunned any film scripts or Hollywood society, that might be even be remotely construed as corrupting public morals--would never have become associated with such a dubious project as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps, New York&#39;s Cardinal Spellman, in his private audience with her, gave her a good dressing down over this role? That we will likely never know, inasmuch as she never spoke of it in later years, though she did denounce her morally suspect, (though quite successful) 1932 film, &#34;Back Street&#34; as &#34;trash&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly by the time she received the distinguished St. Robert Bellarmine Award in 1965 for exemplary public Catholicism, &#34;Ann Vickers&#34; was no longer recalled by the general public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffice it to say that &#34;Ann Vickers&#34; works neither as entertainment or social commentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Dunne&#39;s role as an adulterous social worker, who sleeps around, (between reforming prisons and writing a best seller on correctional rehabilitation) doesn&#39;t dovetail with her temperament or on screen demeanor, and one keeps suspecting that the whole thing is a kind of tongue in cheek gag, (what else can we think when we witness a montage of Miss Dunne&#39;s sympathetic beatific gaze superimposed over a shot of a female prisoner being scourged?) By films end, she has renounced careerism in favor of marriage, (to crusty convict Walter Huston no less--and what kind of lunacy would ever conceive of pairing these two romantically?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irene Dunne completists will no doubt wish to see this curiosity, if only for the chance to hear her promise to rehabilitate a cocaine addict under her charge: &#34;I&#39;m going to get you off the snow cold turkey&#34; !!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if nothing else such sordid goings on, do present her light years from her usual milieu of operatic trills, furbellowed chiffon and strawberry phosphates--cocaine addiction not being the first subject one associates with the irreproachable Miss Dunne.

After spending half an hour examining Rumors, a gay bar located outside Tupelo, Mississippi, SMALL TOWN GAY BAR shifts focus to the murder of Scotty Weaver in Bay Minette in order to demonstrate the risks run by the interview subjects. But there is a problem here. Bay Minette isn&#39;t near Tupelo, as the film implies. It isn&#39;t even in the same state. It is actually about three hundred miles away in coastal Alabama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Malcom Ingram doesn&#39;t exactly rush to point out this fact, nor does he bother to mention that while Bay Minette itself is little more than a wide spot in the road, it is actually about two deep breaths away from the major metro area of Mobile, Alabama--which has a noticeable gay community, quite a few gay bars, and even a congregation of Metropolitan Community Church. If Ingram is disingenuous on these points, one has to ask if he is on others as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking as someone who was born, raised, and continues to live in Mississippi, I have to say that I find most of SMALL TOWN GAY BAR a lot of hooey. Neither Meridian nor Tupelo, the communities upon which Ingram focuses, are as rural, small, or as isolated as he would have you imagine, and gay bars are indeed more common in the state than the film implies. That said, Ingram rather blithely ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean an absence of a gay community, and in doing so he demonstrates a rather profound ignorance of southern culture, which tends to hold those who frequent bars--be they gay or straight--in low esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMALL TOWN GAY BAR is, in my opinion, an instance in which a film maker came to his subject with a personal agenda in hand and then proceeded to film the agenda. Do gays and lesbians living in rural Mississippi face major, sometimes frightening challenges? You bet they do--but that&#39;s no excuse for fiddling with reality to such a degree. The DVD includes a commentary track and a number of deleted scenes, but I found the feature film itself so ridiculous that I didn&#39;t waste any time on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GFT, Amazon Reviewer

This (extremely)low-budget movie is compared to the great classic &#34;Silent Night Deadly Night&#34;, since it is labeled as a Slasher Flick. First let me say that I think that even &#34;Silent Night Part 2&#34; is better than this (that one was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie). &#34;Christmas Evil&#34; tries to get psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes insane,(a strong word), slowly (very slowly). He is irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of Christmas and at work he can&#39;t stand how the fabricated toys are made with such lack of quality and love. Dressed up as Santa he finally goes on a killing spree. Also a strong word, since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects. No tension, no thrills, no gore, no cast. For one exception that is: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing aside Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic &#34;The Green Mile&#34;. He still must be kicking himself these days for ever accepting the role. He truly is the only one who really can act, his supporting role is better than the main lead. (who also isn&#39;t that bad, but if you&#39;re overshadowed by a little supporting character, you&#39;re not great either.). And what about that strange ending ? (you have to see it, to believe it). &#34;Christmas Evil&#34; is downright boring, nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading. This is not a slasher. You wanna see a real Christmas slasher, check out the all time greatest: &#34;Silent Night, Deadly Night&#34;.

Anyone who has spent time working in a hospital or medical facility has got to appreciate this film. The plot is absolutely wild but entertaining from start to finish. The acting is superb. George C. Scott is the brilliant doctor but class A failure as husband, father. Diana Riggs, a sex symbol of the 1960s and 1970s (of The Avengers), saves him from himself. The surrounding cast is superb and the dialogue quite entertaining. I think I enjoyed the film more on viewing it the 4th., 5th. or 6th. time because I caught that much more of the richness of the dialogue and the interplay of the characters. Well worth seeing again and again. You just won&#39;t want to check in to a hospital in the near future.

Why did it sound like the husband kept calling her Appy ? It ruined a great episode and so I can only give it a 6. Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very Hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though I dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die. The more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/10 come on Yankies get your English up to par !

The word &#39;classic&#39; is thrown around too loosely nowadays, but this movie well deserves the appelation. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (possibly the world&#39;s best living comic actor), and the late lamented George Burns make for a comic masterpiece. It is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not death prevented Jack Benny from playing George Burns&#39; part, as had been planned. As it is, the reunion scene in Matthau&#39;s apartment is not likely to be surpassed as a sidesplitter. Definitely one of my desert island films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Enter!!!!!!!!!&#34;

This film was not nearly as much of a chore as I expected it to be. There are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO conspiracy paranoia-fest. Most of the acting is mediocre, but fairly typical for 1970s-style stuff replete with pregnant pauses. A photographer and a model witness some strange goings-on in the woods and soon fall victim to these same goings-on. Flying saucers are spotted, more people disappear - but is it the aliens or our own government&#39;s ultra-secret group of cover-up guys? Soon enough, a reporter and a &#34;UFOlogist&#34; (apparently modeled on the character of the writer-director) are drawn into this unraveling fiasco and become the target of the ultra-secret agents who are as menacing as they are improbable and witless. Then the fun really begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie, predictably, makes about as much sense as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but should be commended for taking itself so seriously. The camera work is OK for a low-budget film, the pacing is pretty good, the script is silly and absurd, and there are continuity issues which are fun to look out for. What are the few seconds of brilliance I mentioned? Honestly, I can&#39;t say much you without writing a spoiler. Suffice to say that the end of the film is, at least, worth fast-forwarding to if you can&#39;t take the middle.

Clint Eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993.Teamed with an absolute master of edge of your seat suspense,Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood delivers as only he can.Also,John Malkovich goes on my list of most effective screen villains in the history of cinema as the demented assassin.As for Rene Russo as Clint&#39;s love interest,I think Kirk Douglas said it best when he said,referring to his own career,&#34;I keep getting older,and my leading ladies keep getting younger&#34;.This film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going.Eastwood and Peterson should team together more often. Top notch movie.

Hi, today i looked this film because of the medium (5,6) IMDb rating. I thought it would worth viewing. Also the comments here were quiet good but after start watching this movie i quick realize that this movie isn&#39;t anyway near a 5,6 ! Its just boring. You can describe the movie with some words also its just the standard horror movie story with all the standard horror movie scenes. I don&#39;t know why people still like those films or why they vote such films better then a 1-3 in IMDb. Just some examples &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bunch of people arriving from somewhere or going / driving to anywhere. They meet somehow on their journey strange people but hey maybe they are just nice so hang out with them. Then a very important scene for every horror movie &#34;Oh my cell phone isn&#39;t working oh oh mine too .. is that strange but we don&#39;t need them so enjoy our ride ...&#34; uhhhhhh our strange person is a strange psychopath better we all sit back and scream a while till he starts cutting parts from us or killing some of us. After a while the bunch of victims get a weapon or chance to escape ofcorse they never think about running away or even kill the psychopath if they got the chance they just talk about what to do until the psychopath got his weapon back with any of the handful of standard tricks they got in those films and all running back as usual ... screaming ... some more to kill ... oh and in the end it gets really exiting sometimes the bad guy wins sometimes some of the victim can escape wow great movies. ... OK if i never ever saw a movie of that kind i would say it is a movie which can be watched but if anyone ever saw any movie of its kind it should be just a boring waste of time because nearly everything in the movie you know before you even watched it because it every time runs like the standard horror movie shematic. .... mmm maybe there is a windows program out there? Horrormoviemaker 2.0 ? You can just pull some adjustment buttons and get the new Shuttle, Saw45674, Jeepers Creepers kind of movie.

When I was a kid in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s anything connected with Disney was by definition great. What happened? They are able to get any actors and actresses they want, the best of their time. But somehow Disney manages to screw things up in spite of their abundant resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disney can afford the best writers, the best producers and directors, but still...they screw things up! This movie is crap. The sad thing is that I suspect Disney in their arrogance does not even know when a movie is good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is only due to the talent of the actors that I can even give it a 3 of 10.

I love documentaries. The Andy Goldsworthy doc was great.I looked forward to this one - but was very disappointed. I knew of Kahn and was intrigued by the idea of his lonely death in a Penn Station men&#39;s room. There must be a story here, I mistakenly believed.The only story here is of sadly deluded women who had affairs with an ugly little famous married man. In the absence of anything like an explanation for this guy&#39;s horrible behavior, we&#39;re given endlessly repeated clips of Kahn walking around and painfully long - supposedly contemplative - shots of his soulless buildings.Actually, some of the buildings are interesting but the thrust of the film asks us to think about the guy himself. The overwrought soundtrack references an emotional tug that is entirely absent from the film. Kahn&#39;s apparent gifts do not excuse his behavior or martyr his mistresses. This film seems to want to give Kahn the great artiste&#39;s free pass and thus make the director and his mother sympathetic figures - I don&#39;t buy it.

In 1970, feminists invaded the &#39;Miss World&#39; beauty contest in London and brought the occasion to a halt by pelting the stage with flour and eggs. Why? Because, rightly or wrongly, they felt the event to be demeaning and degrading to women. I offer no criticism of their actions. Its a free world we live in. What I want to know is: why don&#39;t their modern-day equivalents invade the studios where shows such as this are made and do likewise? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Sex &amp; The City&#39; is all about four self-absorbed women from New York: Carrie is a slave to fashion who turns into a pussycat when a man so much as claps eyes on her, Charlotte yearns to find the perfect man ( they don&#39;t exist, love ) so she can use sex to ensnare the poor devil, lawyer Miranda scares men away by wittering nonsense like &#39;out of touch with my emotions&#39;, and lastly we have Samantha, the living embodiment of the old Martini ad &#39;anytime, anyplace, anywhere&#39;. Feminists hold up these characters - particularly Samantha - as a shining example of modern-day womanhood. Well, if shouting rude words in busy restaurants is progress, I think the feminists should take a long hard look at themselves and what they&#39;re supposed to represent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had &#39;Sex &amp; The City&#39; been the creation of a man, it would have been pulled from the airwaves for being sexist. Instead, like &#39;Charlie&#39;s Angels&#39; before it, it has conned supposedly intelligent women into thinking it has acted as a positive force for good. There&#39;s something very clinical and cold-blooded about the show. &#39;The Benny Hill Show&#39; was sexist too, but at least it was funny.

As the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the opening sentences, you quickly gather that the actors are talentless. The script editor was probably dead and the director should be. To be honest I didn&#39;t manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress scuttling across the floor like a Shetland pony that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never, and I mean never, seen a film as sweaty as this one and I watch tons of crap films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turd.

Well, the episode I just watched had the older &#34;Gastineau Girl&#34; whining about why people keep mentioning her husband (Mr Gastineau, a famous American Football player apparently). She seems unwilling to accept that he&#39;s the only reason she isn&#39;t flipping burgers, she married someone famous and that&#39;s why she has cameras pointed at her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When challenged by an interviewer to explain what she actually does, she gave a wonderfully circular reason for why people should pay attention to her: &#34;I work really hard on my reality TV show&#34;. Then she said &#34;I&#39;m not a celebrity... I&#39;m a personality.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not quite sure who this series is meant to appeal to, except people who&#39;ve had all their intelligence removed. It&#39;s certainly no role model to anyone except gold-diggers as the two stars do nothing but spend money, and all it tells you about rich people is that they have no money problems.

Wow! After the first five minutes of watching this &#34;film&#34;, I was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain, and end my life. It&#39;s really hard to describe what exactly this film is about. I honestly don&#39;t know what kind of human being would even finance a piece of excrement. The film looks to have either been shot on video or 16mm. I normally don&#39;t have a problem with SOV movies, are shoddily made 16mm films, but this was just so awful. And where did they find these &#34;actresses&#34;? I have seen some bad acting, but this takes the cake. Watch the first 5 minutes and you&#39;ll see what I mean. BCI Entertainment should be boycotted for distributing this god awful sludge. This has to be the worst film I have ever had the displeasure of viewing. I want my 74 minutes back! If you are able to sit through the first 5 minutes, without either shooting your TV or committing mass homicide, then give a shot. After all, what have you got to lose?

I realize the line on my summary is not too polite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film written &amp; directed by Scott Caan &amp; starring Giovanni Ribisi,Don Cheadle &amp; himself runs a long 88 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a dog in this puppy of a movie., he is cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie opened in 2 U.S. theatres in late April 2007,for one week &amp; grossed all of $ 914. It quickly went to DVD in early August 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were only able to take about 40 minutes before we turned the DVD off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the type of movie that played on lower half of double bill. You saw the main film &amp; figured lets see what this one is like, You might have walked out before we shut it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 actors &amp; the young ladies in the film all have done &amp; deserve better than this..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ratings: ** (out of 4) 54 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10_

Despite a great soundtrack and the presence of the ever amazing Rappaport and Woods, this is another one of those moronic comedies where New York throws itself at the hero in an effort by the writer and/or director to show what a zany place it is. Yeah there&#39;s some other stuff in the movie that sucks too, but that&#39;s what&#39;s important. The trend for New York independent filmmakers seems to be &#34;I don&#39;t need to be talented, I have NEW YORK!&#34; Okay, to be fair, the movie has its moments. The flashback bit about why the one guy is called Wacky Jack was pretty amusing. The script isn&#39;t a story or a plot, it&#39;s a bunch of not-good scenes tied to each other by featuring the same character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the worst things is that there&#39;s no motive behind what the characters do. Uncle Sam has the kid deliver the drugs, why? If its so important why didn&#39;t Sam do it himself? Then the lead character lies his ass off in scene after scene with absolutely nothing to gain from lying. The guy falls in love with a flight attendant with neither of them having any reason to fall in love. The characters are a bunch of pawns for the writer to move around to see if he can get anything zany to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re easily amused or like watching bad indie movies because they make you feel smarter than watching bad mainstream movies, watch this. If you want to see what a GOOD light hearted crime movie looks like, watch Takeshi Kitano&#39;s &#34;Brother&#34;. &#34;Kicked In The Head&#34; is the perfect example of why so many people hate offbeat indie movies: A LOT OF THEM SUCK. And a note to the director: Don&#39;t be afraid to excite, amuse, enlighten or entertain the audience now and then. Being boring doesn&#39;t make you a better filmmaker than the ones who can interest me.

One of the finest films ever made! Why it only got a 7.6 rating is a mystery. This film is a window into the world of the black experience in America. Should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10. I recommend watching it with &#34;The Long Walk Home&#34; as a companion piece. If you think Whoopi Goldberg&#39;s work is about &#34;Homer and Eddie&#34; or &#34;Hollywood Squares,&#34; think again. Don&#39;t miss this movie, which should have won the Oscar. (And read the book, too!)

This has to be the ultimate chick flick ever. We taped it off the T.V. years ago and I&#39;ve watched it about 30 times over the years. I hadn&#39;t seen it for about 12 years and just recently watched this movie. I&#39;m not lying, I cried from the opening credits to the ending credits. This movie truly tears your heart out, even if you don&#39;t have children.

No words can describe my utter hatred for this appalling rendition of the BTK killer. Rating this film one out of ten compliments this truly disastrous excuse for a film. From start to finish, there was not one single highlight. The entire thing was horrendously put together; the script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, just to name a few. A number of scenes are literally laugh-out-loud-funny, for the atrocious way in which the entire thing is put together. This review may seem like an unjust and scathing attack on a low-budget film, but this is not the case. Just thinking about the movie I have just seen makes my blood start to boil. How this film was ever granted rights for production i will NEVER know. I am almost tempted to actually recommend BTK, because it is truly a stand-out in regards to how pathetic, and disturbingly awful it is. I can honestly say, in all my years of film-going, this is the WORST. MOVIE. EVER. I wasted over an hour of my life on this useless garbage, and would gladly have jumped off the nearest building beforehand, had I known what I was in for. ZERO out of TEN.

Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France from 1960-1980. Always strong at the box-office, and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies, mafia score-settling and World War II battles, Verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on Saturday night. He worked with the cream of the male actors of his day: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I... comme Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand. It&#39;s an oddly static film, taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms, containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Montand gives a good performance, if somewhat dry, and he is well supported by the other actors. I couldn&#39;t help wondering what Costa-Gavras could have done with this story, on the basis of Z (the Lambrakis assassination) and L&#39;aveu (the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists).

Oh yes, I admit I have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash. I can&#39;t say I was forced by aliens who pointed a gun at my head, tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned this awful excuse for a movie on. No I did it with free will. I deliberately tortured myself. Let&#39;s go through the fact here folks. - The acting is an insult to humanity. - The plot (if it exists) is ridiculous. - The character development is horrendous - The characters that appear in the movie are so clichéd you would &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recognize them in your average comic book. - The editing is sloppy and unimaginative. - The camera-work is low key. - The dialogue is simply the worst in cinematic history. - The directing: well let&#39;s say, I bet it wasn&#39;t Hitchcock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then to add to these facts, there was absolutely no talent involved wath so ever. The director must be smoking crack now to forgive himself for inflicting this poison to the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Passport to Paris is one of the worst movies ever made. PERMANENT!

The Woman In Black was a British made for TV movie which was first broadcast on the BBC on Christmave Eve of &#39;89, and again in &#39;92. I believe it made a round on American TV on A&amp;E. It was released on VHS in Britain in the early 90&#39;s but went out of print. A U.S. company released it on DVD later, but that version also sold out. According to the website of the author of the book, the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it won&#39;t be released again, and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out. I found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks. It&#39;s certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east, even though the DVD says, &#34;made in Canada,&#34; ha ha. But it&#39;s a good copy, and you can&#39;t really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare, out of print, and lost in legal disputes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the movie. It&#39;s a period piece set in the 1920&#39;s, with all the very authentic and quaint British settings of that time. The Woman In Black is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the movie is very low-key, but effective and scary. There is no self indulgent gore, violence or much at all in special effects, but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments. It&#39;s a chilling classic styled ghost movie. The movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930&#39;s except for the color. Without all the flash of all the modern horror movies, I&#39;m afraid this film will always just be a lost gem. For me, it places itself as one of my all time favorites.

I have seen this film 3 times. Mostly because I kept thinking while watching it, &#34;have I missed something here?&#34;. Is there some reason this film was made? Was it trying to say something and I just missed it? Well after 3 viewings I failed to come up with an answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the worst thing I can say about any film is that it bored me, and I did not finish it. I will admit there is plenty of eye candy and fast editing and hip music to keep my attention all the way through but is that all a movie should be? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not against extreme violence, it is almost non-stop, but it seems there should be some sort of inspiration. Something that is highlighted by it. The word gratuitous comes to mind but it is worse then that somehow. In the first part of the film we are all given insights into the motivations of the characters. And yes the 3 principles are very good in their roles. But the roles are completely unbelievable. So in the first part we get to know the characters, and in the second part most of em die and use sadistic glee in killing others. That seems to be the whole movie. And the first part has nothing to do with the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example. How could a nice smart guy like Zed agree to join a bunch of junkies and amateurs to do a job like this? It makes no sense. He is portrayed as smart, yet he goes ahead with this suicide mission. The fact that he survives is totally inconsistent with the rest of the hyper-real violence and mayhem. So what are we watching here a Hollywood romance with a happy ending or a super real, super violent blood bath? I recall having the same reaction to two other films this director was involved with: True Romance and Reservior Dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless dreck!

Ronald Colman gives a terrific performance as a stage actor who really gets into his work. When he plays Othello on the stage he takes on the persona with dire results. Good film with a great supporting cast. Well worth watching.

Normally, I have no problem with a movie or story with an ending that leaves you wondering to puzzle out what really happened, when it&#39;s done on purpose...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this movie really feels like they got all but the last 15 minutes done, then realized they had $5 left to finish on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it on TBS... I recommend you not spend money on it either. If you catch it on TV, watch all but the last 15 minutes, then walk away and make your own ending in your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the movie would have been better if they had simply got away, and come back with the State Poice of Feds only to find that the town and the car graveyard was gone, and by all appearances had never been there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Wish I had more thumbs, so I could give that movie 4 thumbs down!&#34;

Bruce Almighty, one of Carrey&#39;s best pictures since... well... a long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I have seen for a long time too... Morgan Freeman plays God well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes. The best scene in, it is where Jim is messing up the anchor man&#39;s voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating: 8/10

I can&#39;t believe that in the 34 prior comments, nobody mentioned that this film is a blatant rip-off of Born Yesterday. A man is hired to bring an ostensibly dumb blonde up to the requirements of a gangster. Hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. Gangster is left in the lurch. But Born Yesterday was an intelligent treatment whereas this is just so much fluff. Technicolor transfer to DVD is deplorable. Natalie Kalmus would be rolling over in her grave. Check out the paperboy. Recognize him? But, it&#39;s historically interesting to see the roots of Rock &#39;n Roll. Also interesting is Ewell&#39;s introduction to CinemaScope, a new format at the time.

I just watched this movie last night, and I HAD to put a warning out for anybody else considering to see this film. In a word - don&#39;t. I seriously feel like this is something that a screenwriting student would have written in a Quentin Tarantino/Eddie Murphy phase, i.e. every other word was a curse word. I don&#39;t have a problem with profuse cursing, as in &#34;Good Will Hunting&#34;, provided it helps to delve more into the characters. In this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an occassional *gasp* or laughter from the audience. The three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype, the wall street jerk, the coffee house jerk, and the &#34;I&#39;m-Not-Gay-Just-In-Touch-With-My-Feminine-Side&#34; slightly-less-of-a-jerk. You just don&#39;t give a damn about any of them! They are all shallow, unredemable losers who you WANT to see lose. For those who dare, this film does have a couple funny moments, the very beginning, and the very end. The toilet/vibrator scene is funny in a sick kinda &#34;Uh, yeah&#34; way. Really though, I would only recommend this film to my worst of enemies.

Imagine this: a high school. Except it&#39;s boarding school, and the kids don&#39;t have parents around. Oh, and it&#39;s in Malibu. And the kids are all thin, white, and gorgeous, with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the &#34;weird&#34; outcast. And there aren&#39;t any reasonable rules, like how they have co-habitation, nuclear weapons in their dorms, coffee stands, a sushi bar, and a complimentary laptop per student.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s the story: A girl, Zoey Brooks, attends PCA, a formerly all-boys school. Absolutely perfect in every possible way, she is smart, pretty, thin, athletic, creative, and everything a perfectionist wants to be. Almost all the boys in school want her, and every girl wants to be her friend. She&#39;s the one everyone comes to for advice, the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan, and is just wonderful. Too bad none of this makes her likable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are we supposed to believe that if we don&#39;t even come close to Zoey&#39;s perfection, we&#39;re bad people? In the show, nothing&#39;s her fault, and if anyone contradicts her, they&#39;re portrayed as the bad guy(Logan). He may be a jerk, but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her loyal group of blind followers are: Chase, the average dumb ass that has a secret crush on her, Michael, the token black guy (and the only decent actor on the set), Lola, a wannabe actress and anorexic, snobby airhead, Quinn, the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff, and Logan, the rich jerk who has a soft side. Yeah, this show basically spews out stereotypes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What ticks me off, though, is that they all try to pretend they&#39;re normal kids. They complain that Logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves, even though they already go to a too-good-to-be-true boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can&#39;t afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis, hardly have homework, and suntan almost every day. Wow, they have it hard! Any other problems? I&#39;m too good-looking, rich, and stress-free! I guess Zoey 101 (what&#39;s the 101 for, anyway?) is Nick&#39;s attempt at trying to portray teens realistically. Except they caught a glimpse of reality, didn&#39;t like it, and decided to give the kids lives like the asses on The Hills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, at least the set&#39;s pretty.

I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about, to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK. The movie was pretty terrible. All cliché, no real plot. Historical and technical inaccuracies abound. Look up the technical specs on DE 529, or any Everts class Destroyer Escort, and you will see what I mean. I now its black history month in the US, and Im going to be called a racist just for saying this, but the history of this ship is not that great. They did some escort work, chased a &#34;submarine&#34; that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed. Sorry, but black people did a lot more in WWII then this silly movie gives them credit for. This movie makes them look like whiners. Let the name calling commence, I can handle it.

Joseph Brady and Clarence Doolittle are two sailors, who have a four-day shore leave in Hollywood.Joe knows everything about girls and can&#39;t wait to see Lola, while Clarence is shyer and needs some advice from his buddy on how to meet girls.They then run into a little boy, Donald Martin, who has ran away in order to join the navy.They take him home and meet his beautiful aunt Susan, who wants to be a singer.Clarence wants Susie to be his girl, but his shyness gets in the way.But he doesn&#39;t feel shy with a waitress, who comes from Brooklyn, like he does.Soon Joe notices he&#39;s in love with Susie.The boys are in a fix when they lie to Susie on meeting with a big time music producer they don&#39;t even know.As they are in a fix with their feelings.George Sidney&#39;s Anchors Aweigh (1945) is a great musical comedy.Gene Kelly is top-notch, once again, in his singing and dancing routines.Frank Sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from Brooklyn.Shy isn&#39;t the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Frank Sinatra, but he plays his part well.Kathryn Grayson is fantastic as Susan Abbott.We sadly lost this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of 88.The 9-year old Dean Stockwell does amazing job as the little fellow wanting to become a sailor.Jose Iturbi does great job performing himself.It&#39;s magic what he does with the piano.Edgar Kennedy plays Chief of police station.Sara Berner is the voice of Jerry Mouse.There&#39;s a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers.Just look at Kelly and Sinatra performing &#34;We Hate to Leave&#34;.It&#39;s so energetic.&#34;If You Knew Susie (Like I Know Susie)&#34; is quite funny.It&#39;s a nice moment when Frank sings Brahms&#39; Lullaby to little Dean Stockwell.It&#39;s lovely to listen to Grayson singing the tango &#34;Jealousy&#34; .The most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world, and there Gene sings and dances with Jerry Mouse.Also Tom Cat is seen there as the butler.They originally asked Mickey Mouse but he refused.The movie was nominated for five Oscars but Georgie Stoll got one for Original Music Score.Anchors Aweigh is some high class entertainment.

I had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of overworked tumbleweeds (probably left over from a bad western) blew across the scene. The bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the obligatory opening stranger-turned-human-sacrifice for no apparent reason lowered his rear view mirror to see a shadow in the back seat. For the next five minutes over the opening credits we are treated to an overhead shot of the car rocking back and forth and only the dramatic made-for-TV-movie music informs us a killing is taking place, not a make-out session. For the next 27 or so hours we are treated to two idiotic psychotics who for some reason seem compelled to drive through the desert Southwest together, going after each other like a demented Abbot &amp; Costello. Even with the &#34;shocking&#34; twists at the end, we are merely left to shake our heads and wonder if the producers and director/writer feel as ashamed and embarrassed as they should for creating this inconsistent, incoherent nonsense.

This is the worst movie I have seen to date. 85 minutes of utterly bad acting,(half the cast seem to be suffering from Asperger&#39;s syndrome) ghastly wigs, strange make-up (including tide lines around wig areas) and holier than thou characters with holier than thou dialogue that makes you want to puke. One comical aspect of this film, if you have the patience to watch it, is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes the unfortunate cast appear in from scene to scene - was this film backed by a catalogue manufacturer of desperately dodgy pastel casual wear? Were the cast paid in clothes for their efforts? They certainly did not deserve paying with anything else! This appalling effort of a film delivers a rambling plot in the first half, blending into an equally confused arch Christian biblefest in the latter. The entire cast and production team should be burnt at the stake, or at the very least crucified!

&#34;Lion King 1 1/2&#34; is the funniest non-theatrical release from Disney. I recently saw this movie again after not seeing it in many years. I remember first time I saw it I didn&#39;t had any expectations at all and were pleasantly surprised by this watchable and highly entertaining movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it better than &#34;Simba&#39;s Pride&#34;? In many ways, yes. Though &#34;Simba&#39;s Pride&#34; wasn&#39;t exactly bad, it did suffer some problems: lack of an good script and bad characterizations, which made impact of what otherwise a okay film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway: It&#39;s nice to see Timon and Pumbaa&#39;s personalities blossom again in the way that we (or certainly me) loved about them in this film; in &#34;Simba&#39;s Pride&#34; they were completely annoying and I didn&#39;t liked the &#34;Timon and Pumbaa&#34; series neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film could easily have been a stupid one, but fortunately the filmmakers didn&#39;t took the wrong turn and instead focused to make this film at times extremely hilarious. There are a few jokes that adults can enjoy on their own. The score is quite good. There are two new songs, which are catchy and two new characters, Timon&#39;s mom, (voiced by recognizable Marge Simpsons&#39; Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max, which are enjoyable. The friendship between Timon and Pumbaa are touchingly portrayed. The emotional scenes are well integrated in the comical story and doesn&#39;t feel out of place, which it could have easily done (especially in comedies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is there something that distracts this picture from getting 10 votes from me? Yes, there is. Although they fortunately doesn&#39;t impact too much, but I&#39;ll mention them: 1. Many of the scenes from the first film are used in this one. Personally, it was weird to see the old scenes integrated with the new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. During the climax, some of the jokes becomes lame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Storywise, this is Timon&#39;s story and although the filmmakers try to integrate his tale with Simba&#39;s, it makes the screenplay feel a little rushed at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, those details doesn&#39;t impact this otherwise amusing movie. It is the only really acceptable Disney sequel, which should be in every movie collection.

Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm&#39;s owner (Jim Bacchus). It&#39;s not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton&#39;s beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian&#39;s motives for wooing her. However, Brian does come up with a great security device. It&#39;s called CHOMPS, which stands for canine home security system. The device, which looks like a dog, is actually a computer controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and emit siren sounds to capture burglars. The rival owner sends two bungling spies (one is Red Buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS save Norton security? This is a fun family flick from the old school of good, clean entertainment. CHOMPS is, of course, a real dog, played by the adorable and talented Benji. In fact, Benji has a duel role, as Brian has a &#34;real&#34; dog named Rascal, too. Just watching this little dog in action is pure joy, as he is able to scale walls, &#34;pull&#34; trucks, and operate machine buttons to capture the bad guys. The human cast is also quite nice, with everyone giving upbeat performances that are infectious. Costumes, scenery, and production values are good, too. Although you may have trouble locating the film, it would be well worth the effort to secure a view for your closest loved ones. CHOMPS is a wonderful, wholesome diversion from the world&#39;s woes.

CAUTION: SPOILERS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this film moved a bit slow at times, the brilliant scenery, richness of the characters and powerful themes make `Morte a Venezia&#39; a rewarding experience. I have not read Thomas Mann&#39;s book, but I am certain that Visconti&#39;s visual splendour, musical score, and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The study of Gustav von Aschenbach alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behaviour and passion. This tendency is demonstrated in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes Music as being both mathematical--i.e. quantifiable--and emotional. This conflict arises again in the scene where young Tadzio is alone playing `Fuer Elise&#39; in lobby of the Hotel and Gustav recalls his visit to a bordello where he is drawn to a prostitute who plays the same song. In his flashback, after paying the prostitute, Gustav is clearly physically seized by the consequences of his actions. This reaction acts as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that Tadzio represents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, Gustav is forced to make his biggest decision: stay in Venice and resign himself to his lust and temptations? Or flee Venice to save his own life? His early attempt to flee Venice at the train station resulted in a futility and foreshadows the outcome of prolonging his stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complimenting the captivating character interaction, Visconti&#39;s powerful scenery (especially of Venice at Dawn and the final scene of Tadzio walking into the water and pointing to the horizon) renders this film a true masterpiece.

The mystery and its solution was a great noir conceit. I do have some questions though, maybe I wasn&#39;t paying enough attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who killed the neighbor and why? Who killed the replacement girl and why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And some minor quibbles, they should have shown the stopoff at the hotel for the switch. Not that they should have shown the switch, but they should have shown Jim and the girl going in the hotel, Jim going to the bathroom, coming out and being told by the bartender that his girlfriend went to the car without him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then, Jim getting back in the car and seeing the sleeping woman, and little girl in his back seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would have given the viewer a sporting chance at figuring out the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I taped it though, I&#39;d like to see it again.

Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD. The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere. It was well shot, but, then again, it is a big budget movie. It was too predictable, even for a chick flick. I even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end, the only thing I didn&#39;t know was how. Too politically correct. Very disappointing. The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful. But, if you want that, watch National geographic. I love Lane, but I&#39;ve never seen her in a movie this lousy. As far as Gere goes, he&#39;s a good actor, but he had movies like this, so I&#39;m not surprised. An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.

Well this is the best comedy movie i have ever seen... My both Favorite actors did good job. Salman khan and Aamir khan rocked. Hope to see Andaz Apna Apna part 2 soon as i heard they will come back with part 2 as well. i have request to those who haven&#39;t watched it yet. please buy DVD and watch it u wont feel bored. i am watching this movie 1 times a week. All other was also good in this movie. Paresh Rawal, Shakti and others The music is also good it have also nice songs. there are some sense which will kill u from laughing Salman khan did very nice role and also Aamir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so must watch movie excellent job by actors and director..

The premise is ridiculous, the characters unbelievable, the dialogue trite, and the ending absurd. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe me, I&#39;m a fan of Kevin Kline, but watching him do a Pepe Le Pew accent for 2 hours as a supposed Frenchman is not nearly as amusing as it sounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For her part, Meg Ryan is once again as perky and adorable as a (take your pick): kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you happen to think is the cutest creature on earth. She also bears not the slightest resemblance to a real human being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie strikes me as an opportunity seized by buddies Lawrence Kasdan and Kline to vacation in Paris and the south of France while being well-paid for it. So I can&#39;t really blame them.

Yes, Keaton looks like he really did enjoy making this film. With a skip in his step in his tailored pin-striped suits, he&#39;ll remind you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is the young hood who only does it to pay for his mother&#39;s high-priced medical bills &amp; to send his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to law school. No one even knows Johnny Kelly IS Johnny Dangerously until later on in the film. Joe Piscopo is Vermin &amp; doesn&#39;t like Johnny one bit (&amp; I don&#39;t like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a nice singing/dancing routine while Johnny revels in it. I love the part when they&#39;re in the ever-changing getaway car! The cop who&#39;s &#34;calling all cars&#34; is the Skipper from Gilligan&#39;s Island! See this one for 1930&#39;s gangster laughs! The gags in this film are hilarious but you have to catch them or you&#39;ll miss them! Look in the background of every scene.

Horrible waste of time - bad acting, plot, directing. This is the most boring movie EVER! There are bad movies that are fun (Freddy vs. Jason), and there are bad movies that are HORRIBLE. This one fits into the latter. Bottom Line - don&#39;t waste your time.

As with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s SOYLENT GREEN has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is . Overpopulation means there`s too many people to feed ? I was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies . Stalin`s policy in the Soviet Union in the 1930s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was Mao`s rural policy in China which led over 30 million starvation deaths in the 1950s . And let`s not forget the great famines in the horn of Africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation . You might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on Earth , Hong Kong and Macau , have never suffered a famine in modern times . Likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn`t strictly down to overpopulation - it`s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside ( It`s a symptom of industrial progress - not of too many births ) so the image of the streets of New York city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don`t be fooled into thinking SOYLENT GREEN is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because I consider this to be the best ecological film of the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;70s . It plays on the contempary audience`s knowledge of the world where Sol and Thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit , brandy and fresh meat . Thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky , puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line &#34; If I could afford it I`d smoke two , maybe three of these a day &#34; . But it`s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that`s memorable as Thorn gazes at the images of wild animals , flowers , running water and snow covered mountains , a world Thorn`s generation has never known . This is a very haunting scene which makes SOYLENT GREEN a very memorable film , combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of Edward G Robinson as the wise old Jew Sol Roth

What can I say about Kramer vs. Kramer? On the surface it&#39;s rather simple but underneath it deals with emotions greater than life itself. It delivers many fantastic moments, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. You sympathize with the characters and you care about them. Many films fail at this, Kramer vs. Kramer is a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think everyone would agree the acting is superb. Once you watch Kramer vs. Kramer, for some time the acting in most other films starts to feel plastic and unemotional. The actors seem to get along well with their roles and the characters really live on the screen. There&#39;s some beautiful chemistry between them. I think the best performance in the film comes from the young Justin Henry. He&#39;s different from any other child actor I&#39;ve ever seen. He&#39;s amazingly natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there&#39;s some kind of neurotic beauty in Meryl Streep. And Dustin Hoffman delivers one of the best performances of his career! The story is very well written. It&#39;s simple but complicated at the same time. The concept is the simple part, the feelings associated is the complicated part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#39;t seen this film yet, you&#39;re definitely missing out! See it now!

I&#39;ve been intrigued by this film for a while, in part because of the extremely high score here on IMDb -- a 9.0 average with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of any accessible silent film! How had I not heard of this film before this website? Well, you can&#39;t always trust the ratings. This is actually a very good film, preserved quite well if the fine VHS transfer I rented is any indication -- excellent acting by the principals, especially William Haines as Brown, and good location work at Cambridge with some fine action footage in the climactic Harvard/Yale football game -- but the story must have seemed a hoary chestnut even in 1926. Obnoxious, self-centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place, becoming in the process a caring, self-sacrificing friend; I doubt people in 1926 found much that was really exciting in the last few reels, the predictability factor is high. Still, it starts out very well, and is certainly deserving of being remembered, if not praised to the heavens. Maybe the previous 350 voters are mostly Harvard men...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT Now 600+ voters and the score has actually climbed to 9.2! Seriously, folks, there is ballot-stuffing going on here - I defy anybody to explain why this is a better film than &#34;Metropolis&#34; or &#34;The General&#34;!

Kurosawa is a proved humanitarian. This movie is totally about people living in poverty. You will see nothing but angry in this movie. It makes you feel bad but still worth. All those who&#39;s too comfortable with materialization should spend 2.5 hours with this movie.

Rob Schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements, facials and performances of &#34;not humans&#34;. This time he is The Animal. Marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day, nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked, so Marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man. But on his way to the crime scene, he crashes with his car and gets really damaged. He doesn&#39;t remember what happens and at the next ordinary day, his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts. Of course, we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings, are useless. She is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative characters. The negative character, is destiny if I could use this metaphor. Marvin should find out, how to become a normal human being again. By the way-his animal instincts, helps him in some situations. Schneider&#39;s performance is a so-so. The movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies, called mindless fun as I have written above. So watch it for the monkey style Rob Schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that Schneider appears in. He is a great comedian but this is not his best movie.

Of all the films I have seen, this one, The Rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. The direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain. &#34;How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy&#34;? Gary Busey is know for his &#34;B&#34; movies, but this is a sure &#34;W&#34; movie. (W=waste).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take for example: about two dozen FBI &amp; local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. Inside the jeep is MA and is &#34;confused&#34; as to why all the cops are about. Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, MA being killed straight off. The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough. Truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle.

I really enjoyed this episode, which was a great surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have acquired. From a pure writing perspective, &#39;The 16mm shrine&#39; is an absolute treat, with fantastic dialogue and character analysis, typical of Sterling. In particular I really enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode, tackling themes of existence and reality, whilst balancing it with more psychological topics such as denial, pride, and desire. &#39;The sixteen-millimeter shrine&#39; is an episode about how these ideas based around an unwillingness to accept change can seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the ever-changing world. It is also a fantastic example of cerebral Twilight Zone; one that explores the mind rather than the world outside it. These elements all come together very nicely to create a thought provoking and incredibly interesting 25 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The episode is not without its faults however, which mainly lay in Lupino and Leisen shoes. Ironically, I felt Lupino was unconvincing throughout, with only a few scenes that could count as memorable. This of course being an absolute shame considering how well Sterling had written her character. Furthermore Leisen didn&#39;t seem to know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes having them stand around on set doing next to nothing -which probably explains why accepted the poor performances from Lupino half the time-. Thankfully Balsam does a good job of covering up a lot of weak spots, helping redeem the show from an acting perspective at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said previously however, if you&#39;re a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction, this shouldn&#39;t be as bad as it&#39;s sometimes made out to be. In addition to the writing that I mentioned above, the episode also features some fantastic photography (it still amazes me that the show looks this good nearly fifty years later!) and decent enough set-design. Overall &#39;The sixteen-millimeter shrine&#34; is a great episode and above all is certainly one to make you think.

I had been amazed by director Antal&#39;s Kontroll back in 2003. His first American project, Vacancy, was less impressive but a decent start. Armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above the level of a B movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver. Antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick. Then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn&#39;t really deliver in that department either. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you are left with is one implausible situation after another, a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money. If you look past the sharp cinematography, cast and the tight music score, you&#39;re left with what could have been a below average direct-to-video featuring Van Damme or Seagal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time.

First of all,the whole idea of remaking a classic such as &#34;Psycho&#34; is nothing short of ludicrous.A lot of time and effort was wasted here.I am sure they are smart enough to know that they could not improve on the original,so they must have had a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock on their minds.However,the idea that began as a well intentioned tribute, results in being a slap in the face to the horror master.This movie is poorly produced,poorly acted,and unnecessary to begin with.The original classic stands well on it&#39;s own,even after 40 years.The event of Hitch returning from the grave and coming after the people responsible for this piece of trash is unlikely,but if I were them,I would sleep with one eye open just in case.Don&#39;t waste your time.

Anyone with a young boy in the house who won&#39;t watch black &amp; white movies should put this on their television set. When the child walks by, wondering what all the on screen shouting and shooting&#39;s about, tell him this is a picture for adults and that he isn&#39;t big enough to watch it yet. That&#39;ll hold him there for a few minutes; director George Stevens and his team will keep him to the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my father did that to me, anyway, and I&#39;m the better man for it. This classic adventure yarn, set in India during the British occupation, features a trio of Army sergeants who find their tight union facing dissolution as one prepares to marry his sweetheart. Help arrives in the form of a vicious Thuggie revolt that the soldiers find themselves united against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Gunga Din&#34; was one of the great movies to come out of Hollywood&#39;s finest year, 1939. Even more than most great movies from that Golden year, it is entertaining in a very immediate and accessible way. The theme music is instant hummable nirvana. While shot in California, the camera work (the only thing in &#34;Gunga Din&#34; that got so much as an Oscar nomination) has a windblown grandeur that feels very much like the Raj of a hundred years before. The battle scenes are shot in a very realistic manner, not too violent but very messy as people fall and shoot and run in all corners of each frame in a way that feels real, not staged like some Cecil B. DeMille Biblical slaughter fest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script doesn&#39;t just set up action scenes, it also develops the relationship of the three sergeants with great dollops of humor. The main focus is on Sgt. Cutter, chasing after tall tales of golden treasures. It&#39;s a rare actioner for Cary Grant, and his lightness is just right for a film that never takes itself seriously even as it develops taut suspense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anchoring the trio is Sgt. MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), who dotes over his elephant Annie and tries to protect Cutter from his own hare-brained schemes. He&#39;s just as funny in his own way, leaving Sgt. Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr., displaying some nice Errol Flynnish dash) as the one with the love interest and grounding enough to know he needs to chuck his boyish pals and grow up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If &#34;Gunga Din&#34; was a Lifetime movie, it would be about Joan Fontaine&#39;s efforts to save her man from his two loser friends and their skull crushing hijinks. But since it&#39;s a guys&#39; film, the accent here is on how the threesome must stay together and save Ballantine from a fate worse than death, not only marriage, but as Cutter indignantly exclaims several times, the tea business, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The political correctness police are hard on this film, not so much for the gender issue but the idea of British soldiers saving poor Indians from the vicious Thuggies. It reeks of colonial apologia. Thankfully, this film was made back when, and the producers thus felt no need to spell out the obvious liberalism at the heart of the film, that these three sergeants, so full of derring-do and false racial pride, have to be saved along with the rest of their army by a humble bhisti that only one of the three had any time for when he sought their approval. After all, for all their swashbuckling glory, the film&#39;s true sacrifice involves the title character, played so heart-wrenchingly by Sam Jaffe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back when this film was made, movie mogul Jack Warner had a saying: You want to send a message, use Western Union. Still, it seems like the messages were flying fast and furious in &#34;Gunga Din.&#34; I watch the film now and wonder if audiences back then were meant to wonder what Gunga Din was really up to when he led Cutter to the golden temple. Was he really plotting revenge against his British overlords? Would he have been justified in doing so, especially given MacChesney&#39;s cold treatment of him? When Col. Weed delivers that eulogy, the poem by Rudyard Kipling on which the film is loosely based, was it with a nod in the direction of imperialism&#39;s folly, of lording it over someone who proved &#34;a better man than I am&#34; in the end? What did they make of the Guru&#39;s great speech, delivered in perfect clipped English: &#34;You have sworn an oath as soldiers to maybe die for a faith, which is your country, England. Well, I can die for my country and my faith as readily as you...India, farewell.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the same character also instructs his brutal followers: &#34;Kill for the love of killing! Kill for the love of Kali! Kill! Kill! Kill!&#34; Which means we are allowed to hate him and root for the British, and save the questions about what it all means for later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What &#34;Gunga Din&#34; means to me, most of all, is the quickest, surest 90-minute thrill ride on video. Cutter never found his golden temple, but there&#39;s one for all of us watching &#34;Gunga Din.&#34;

I just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it. It still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost wrote Bonnie Hunt a letter to tell her how much I love it. David Duchovny&#39;s grief scene is so flippin real!!! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite line is when Duchovny says &#34;I miss Elizabeth but I ache for Grace&#34;. Oh man! I&#39;m crying just thinking about it. ALSO... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are sooooooooooooo the perfect Chicago area couple!! I know them I swear! I&#39;m related to them I&#39;m sure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is in my three times a year rotation!!! I&#39;d watch it once a week but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;d get too used to it!!! I always want to make it a special day when I watch it!!

How this has not become a cult film I do not know. I think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Runaway Car&#34; attempts to pass itself off as a fast-paced thriller, but taking the quality of acting (good God it&#39;s bad), the storyline, the practicalities of the car&#39;s demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh. And laugh you will. Films are made to entertain us, and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a film&#39;s worth. This film is the pinnacle in entertainment, I laughed from beginning to end. At one point I got short of breath and nearly choked, it really is that funny at some points. When the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook didn&#39;t rip the car roof to pieces, I was laughing hysterically. But when the baby starting swinging around in the air, nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree, tears were running down my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played Jesus in Madonna&#39;s &#34;Like A Prayer&#34; video. He seems to get everywhere.

When I saw that this film was only 80 minutes long, I thought we were in trouble. Condensing the gigantic W. Somerset Maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen. But you know, the movie&#39;s not half bad, and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve heard many film buffs complain that Leslie Howard was a wet noodle of an actor, and he was, but I can&#39;t think of anyone more suited to play the role of Philip Carey than a wet noodle, for that&#39;s certainly what Carey is. Howard plays him well, which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly, then finally take him out and buy him a spine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, and then there&#39;s Bette, as the girl with whom Carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him. I didn&#39;t know what on earth the appeal of Mildred was in the book, and the movie stays true to that detail. But as played by Davis, she does become the most fascinating character in the story, and if she&#39;s nasty and unlikable, she&#39;s at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time. Davis&#39;s performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting, much as Brando&#39;s would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out &#34;Stella!!&#34; in that little-known Tennesee Williams play, and it&#39;s not hard to see why. Davis is intense to the point of scary. She makes no effort to wring any sympathy from the audience, and she allows herself to look ugly and most unglamorous. Her appearance when Carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed disease (though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it&#39;s an STD) is shocking. Of course, it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the Production Code went into effect; if it had been made a year later, you can bet things would have been a bit different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, much of the novel, and many of its most interesting parts, are left on the cutting room floor, and the story really does become about Carey and Mildred and not much else. I found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of Maugham&#39;s novel, but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now, so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: B+

If you thought Herbie trying to kill himself by driving off a bridge in &#39;The Love Bug&#39; was daft, wait &#39;till you see him acting horny in this bewilderingly silly second sequel. Dean Jones is back as the driver who competes in the Paris to Monte Carlo rally; this time his sentient VW falls in love with another car in the race, a Lancia driven by Julie Sommars. By this point in the series the energy and charm is lacking even more than in &#39;Herbie Rides Again&#39;; the movie is overlong and threadbare, although it&#39;s watchable thanks to the return of Jones&#39;s typically likable performance, a few funny bits, and the cast&#39;s frantic mugging.

I actually liked this movie until the end. Sure, it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. Until the end, that is. For her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch-up to the other classically trained students, what does the main character do? Wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition? No. She tortures and butchers the great sensuous Habanera from Carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable Brittany Spears-wannabe pop song. My ears bled! And, in the supreme moment of horror, her teachers gave her a standing ovation! Any teacher not in a Spears-induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot. Save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!

The image of movie studios being financially-driven instead of creatively is not without truth (in fact, it&#39;s more true than false). This begs the question why Castle Rock Entertainment allowed Kenneth Branagh to create a full-length, uncut version of &#34;Hamlet&#34; with his complete creative control among other things. Of course, Branagh had to agree to some concessions (a star-studded cast, and a 2.5 hour version for wider release), but why would the film studio allow Branagh to spend money on a 4 hour version that they knew few would see? Could they have, at least in this case, had enough respect for the material and Branagh&#39;s vision to create something for only a few people? That is not a question that I can answer. Whatever the reason, this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching &#34;Hamlet.&#34; Everyone knows the story, so I will not spend much time on that. However, unlike other productions of the play, stage included, this is a completely uncut production, which has never been done before. According to some, Shakespeare never intended for the play to be produced uncut, leaving the decision of what to include to the director&#39;s discretion. That being said, I have no doubt that had he been able to see it, the Bard would have been overjoyed with Branagh&#39;s production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is top-heavy with film stars, although most have mere bit parts. All play their parts equally well. I would have thought Branagh too old to play the part of Hamlet, and while he still may be, his performance more than makes up for it. Hamlet is a complex part, displaying every emotion from grief to anger, happiness to madness, and everything in between. Branagh nailed it. Derek Jacobi is terrific as the wily Claudius, whose deception and treachery sets all these things in motion; his unique voice is perfect for the role. Julie Christie is also very good as Gertrude, Hamlet&#39;s caring mother who doesn&#39;t realize what is going on until late in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The classical actors are cast in bit parts (Judi Dench is on for all of 60 seconds and has no lines), but at least they&#39;re in it. Surprisingly, no one takes this to heart; everyone gives it their all, and it shows. Special mention has to go to Jack Lemmon and Billy Crystal, who are excellent. Robin Williams is a little too silly, but he&#39;s not bad (his part is pretty small anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, this is undeniably Branagh&#39;s show. He adapted one of the most famous plays in history, and in so doing, he took on a whale of a project; it&#39;s impressive that he got it done, but the fact that the film is this good is a monumental achievement. What I really liked about this film is that you don&#39;t have to be a Shakespeare scholar to enjoy it. As most people know, Shakespeare is difficult to digest, but Branagh and his cast understand this. &#34;Hamlet&#34; is still immensely enjoyable to just sit and listen to the actors deliver the brilliant dialogue and excellent acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must see for anyone and everyone. It may be four hours long, but it&#39;s definitely worth it.

It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino&#39;s most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven&#39;t hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&amp;A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&amp;A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily Mr Tarantino&#39;s best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino&#39;s own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez&#39;s From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt&#39;s performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune&#39;s blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad &amp; the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough&#39;s Great Escape leader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger&#39;s Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT.

I saw this important intense film tonight. Its Richard Gere and Claire&#39;s Dane&#39;s most important and best work. Gere deserves an Oscar for his fine portrayal of a man being forced into early retirement as a sex offender registrar administrator. Claire Danes is riveting as the woman Gere handpicks to replace him - a woman he tries to teach all he can while investigating one final case in which Gere&#39;s character is convinced one of those he is charged to monitor may be holding a young girl hostage. The subject matter is shocking, sex offenders and those who monitor them, but this film will not soon be forgotten. I know I will be haunted by Gere&#39;s portrayal for a very long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins portrayal of a serial killer has a screen portrayal terrified and so engaged me. The film opens with a shocking statistic so don&#39;t miss the opening credits. Intense and memorable. Richard Gere&#39;s finest role proving the man can act. Danes can as well and both do extraordinarily well in this often challenging film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a gutsy film and Gere gives a multi-layered deeply felt performance. Just give him the Oscar now...he deserves it!

Although allegedly autobiographical, this movie demonstrates very little insight both into the protagonist&#39;s psychology (resulting in a flat, fragmented characterization) as well as into larger-scale historical processes, and my hope of either learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary Iran remained unfulfilled. Instead, I found my sensibilities somewhat dulled as a succession of bearded Islamic villains replaced each other taunting, torturing or killing the wantonly victimized prototypical middle-class Iranian whose Western cultural sympathies were patent (and whose exoneration the movie quite blatantly seeks.) The deeper understanding the movie does seem to demonstrate is that of the mass-media market, as it serves to nourish prevalent occidental folk-ideologies (i.e. a &#34;crowd pleaser&#34;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What redeemed the movie from being outright boring was its creative animation - genuinely minimalistic imagery which, nevertheless, always kept the screen rich, expressive and unambiguous - no small fete for which I do give it some stars.

The movie opens upon Julian Sands, lying on his back, a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it, about two feet above him. That was so provocative, and I thought, &#34;Here we go! A good vampire movie!&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then it died. That was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination. It was slow, uneventful drivel thereafter. I was vastly disappointed, as my previous experience with Sands&#39; acting was quite enjoyable. However, this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even Julian Sands&#39;s questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rates a 1.1/10 from...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Fiend :.

I&#39;ve seen a few of Mr. Boorman&#39;s movies and didn&#39;t like much of them. Not that they are bad movies, quite the contrary are good movies, but not content I personally found entertaining. However I think Where the Heart Is, although made to cater to the less than art savvy American audience, is masterful as satire, and as social commentary of the times it was made in. I&#39;ve had to replace this movie in my collection at least a half a dozen times, since every time I loan it out to someone I know could appreciate it&#39;s artistry on all its levels, my copy fails to come back home to me, lol. The last time took 7 years to replace it since it was out of print for VHS sales, has never been made as a DVD that I know of, and had to wait till one of the premium cable channels ran it before I could tape it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite aspect after the nail-on-the-head social commentary is the paintings by Timna Woollard. I&#39;ve searched for 15 years to find anyone or anywhere that could lead me to where her work is available for sale. Or better yet a copy of the paintings in the movie without the ending credits rolling over them. I have a room in my house that I dedicated to putting copies of her paintings in, and no one seems to know if it ever was released as a coffee table book, or video aquarium, or as a documentary of her work. If anyone does know of where I can acquire any sort of copy of Timna&#39;s work or where her studio is in England, please do not hesitate to contact me via email.

I first heard about this film about 20 years ago when I was a kid in grade school(!), it just so happened that I was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day, and under the entry for movies (or cinema, I don&#39;t remember), were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental, and one of them shown on the page was a still for OffOn. It really intrigued me, since it stood out the most on the page (it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 18 or so years later, the public library here where I live had available for checkout the whole 4-DVD set of &#34;Treasures of American Film Archives&#34; released by the National Film Preservation Foundation. So when I was reading the notes on the DVD cases for the set, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the discs. After all these years, I could finally see the film! After viewing it, it slightly wasn&#39;t was I was expecting it to be (it tended to be a more organic-looking film, not that that&#39;s a bad thing, but I was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic), but it was still an impressive film, IMHO, considering the techniques Scott Bartlett used to make the film, including hand-tinting the film itself, and using video equipment for some of the film&#39;s scenes (filmed off of a video monitor), giving it a more distressed, lo-res look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong, the techniques used in this film were quite ground-breaking for 1972. That&#39;s why it&#39;s still one of my favorite short/experimental films, and a creative inspiration for me as well...

This film uses all art-house clichés (slow pace, long static shots, minimal amount of dialog) to try to hide the fact that there really is nothing worth watching here: There is no plot to speak of, the characters are dreary (female lead) or cliché (Tersteeghe&#39;s character), and they do not ever talk to each other about anything that concerns their rather uneventful lives. The film is centered around a woman who finds out about her husbands adultery. Instead of confronting him, she half-heartedly takes revenge by committing adultery herself. After a fight and a reconciliation with her sister - who knew about the adultery without telling her - she asks her husband to stop cheating on her. They seem to be re-united as a family. Two other story lines - the planned move of the woman&#39;s elderly father with his young wife to Guernsey and the rivalry with the woman&#39;s sister - do not offer any interesting developments. The suicide of a colleague of the woman that seems to set off events in the film is not a subject in itself. For 2005 - or any other year for that matter - this is not enough to make an interesting film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, what little possibilities for dramatic development there are in the script are not used or are consciously avoided, as when both the woman and her sister mark a particular piece of furniture from their fathers house which is going to be sold because of his planned move. Both sisters want this particular piece and given their rivalry in the past - over much more important things than furniture: men - this could in theory lead to a confrontation. Or the matter could be resolved by one sister giving way to the other. Either way, this would not be a very interesting or original development of the story but at least it would constitute some development. The film clearly sets this situation up (with both sisters looking intently at each other during the marking and one sister having mentioned she does not want to draw straws) but it cheats us out of any resolution: the scene simply ends and how this - in itself rather dreary and materialistic - issue is solved, is not shown. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although almost completely absent, the dialog that is in the film is excruciatingly flat and tepid. For example, when during a visit to Guernsey, the 2 sisters address their rivalry it is in a three line dialog that has a childish &#34;yes it is - no it isn&#39;t&#34; ring to it. The fight and reconciliation scene with the 2 sisters is completely without dialog - giving a highly artificial, overly stylised and unrealistic impression and considerably reducing its impact. The way the woman finally - finally! - addresses her husbands adultery in a single line of dialog has to be seen to be believed - and is at the same time completely unbelievable. The husband does not seem to have any noticeable reaction or if he has any, it is not shown. The woman does not mention her own adultery to her husband. The scene showing the woman, husband and their young son asleep on an airliner, watched by the sister is possibly meant as a happy end, but the way the characters addressed the issues of their lives in what went before makes this unlikely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of its slow pace, uninteresting story, leaden direction and absurd lack of dialog, I found this film an example of everything that can be wrong with an art-house movie and a complete waste of time.

Spoiler below, but read on or you&#39;ll never know the horrible fate that awaits all planing to rent &#34;Rodentz&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a moonlit night, in a remote research laboratory, a major medical breakthrough is about to have deadly results. A chemical compound that was created to &#34;hunt and destroy&#34; deadly cancer cells has leaked from the hazardous waste disposal system into the building&#39;s basement. Now, the rodents involved in the laboratory experiment upstairs are not the only rats in the facility that will become the altered species. Professor Schultz, a leading bio-researcher, has just determined that the addition of a new enzyme now enables his &#34;hunt and destroy&#34; formulation to regenerate for the length of time necessary to neutralize deadly cancer tumors. When three varying degrees of the new mixture are administered to three different rats and the rest poured down the faulty &#34;Waste Hazard&#34; sink, shocking side-effects result in a night of terror.....right.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is probably the worst film I&#39;ve seen this year. Everything about it screams &#34;Low-budget!&#34;, from the horrendous acting to the special effects which are some of the worst I&#39;ve ever seen. The characters are clichéd morons and act in stupid, predictable ways: walking down dark hallways alone, looking for a cat, tripping and falling so the &#34;rats&#34; can catch up with them, boarding themselves up in a small room, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some films are cheaply made, this film really takes the cake. Every possible corner is cut, everything from reusing earlier shots, filming the &#34;Lab&#34; hallways from different angles to make it look bigger (That reminds me--why were only TWO guys working in this freakin&#39; massive building?!?!?!?), to music and special effects that could be done on a children&#39;s workshop PC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings me to the worst aspect of this steaming pile of dung--the special effects. Just horrendous. The computer generated rats look so fake and stand out in every scene so even the dumbest of film buffs could see they are computer generated. And that giant rat suit--OH MY GOD!!!!!!!! seriously, are we supposed to believe that freaking beany baby is a monster? Just pitiful........On the better side, some of the gore looks pretty cool, especially considering the budget. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors all suck. no one involved with the production cared or knew what they were doing. I&#39;ve wasted enough time with review, just take my advice, it&#39;s garbage. 1/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the DVD: The transfer sucks, the audio is passable and there&#39;s a commentary track on the disk by the director and two of his friends, who say they had absolutely nothing to do with making the film but were there to ask questions and make comments. All three of these sub-human primordial slime are so incredibly stupid that they should be institutionalized before they can harm themselves or others. I don&#39;t want to waste any more of you kind reader&#39;s time or mine, for I am starting to remember more than I want to about this film..... DVD rating: 1/10.

I found the film Don&#39;t Look In The Basement to be very good, with some great characters in it. It is about a young psychiatric nurse called Nurse Charlotte Beale(Rosie Holotik),who is going to start work at a isolated mental asylum. Whilst there, she meets various sorts of different characters including Dr. Geraldine Masters who becomes in charge of the asylum after the the owner of the hospital Dr. Stephens gets killed by one of the patients by hitting him with an axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favourite characters in the film are Mrs Challingham(Reah MacAdams), a very funny little old lady, Allison who is a nymphomaniac, and Sam(Bill McGhee) a young black guy who goes around all Day seeming to be in a world of his own all of the time. The film was a very low budget film but was still a really great film. I know that it was on the &#39;Video Nasties&#39; list back in the 80&#39;s but a did not think that it had a lot of gore in it, Alothough it did have some disturbing senses in it GREAT FILM RECOMMENDED!!!.

Interesting cartoon, included on the DVD of &#34;The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra&#34;. I especially like the way the color was used in the background art--very artistic for Columbia, whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget (and the results looked like it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wonder, however, how a certain... um, finger gesture... ever got past the censors. Granted, the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in 1937 than it is today. You&#39;d think someone besides the animators would have noticed, though--especially since it&#39;s seen three times in the scene in question! And based on the context, I suspect that its inclusion was intentional, something the animators slipped in just to see if the censors WOULD notice!

1. Aliens resemble plush toys and hand puppets, while having arms that don&#39;t function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Aliens mastered intergalactic space travel, but they don&#39;t know how to push an unlocked vault door open, yet can push open a door being held shut by five people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Old Security Guards know how to get a hold of C4, and are just waiting for the right time to use it, say, when they are suddenly fired for no explainable reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Apparently, US Army boot camp, in the 80&#39;s, involved several sessions of &#34;garden tool combat&#34;, including the pirouette spin of death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. To impress your prudish girl friend, you have to &#34;save the world...err...neighborhood&#34; from aliens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. All women are sluts, either openly or secretly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Scummy night clubs look like bad diners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. &#34;Scummy&#34; waitresses double as dancers for The Fontanelles (how did they get talked into this?) who can only do bad 60&#39;s dance moves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Army privates secretly dream of being Rambo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Grenades apparently have a setting for &#34;flash-bang&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. Being burned alive apparently only leaves one with minor burns on their arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. US Army Staff Sargeants apparently happen to always be in the area and do nothing about aliens in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13. Aliens apparently always &#34;go home&#34;, which means back to the vault they were un-locked in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14. Aliens are attracted to bright lights, which apparently means in the Los Angeles area one would assume, the protagonist&#39;s house is the most brightly lit thing in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15. Showing 16 parking scenes in a movie makes the audience clamor for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16. Vans from the 80&#39;s apparently have horrible suspension systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17. Comedy is supposed to happen in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18. Horror is supposed to happen in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;19. Spoofs and homages are supposed to happen in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20. This film cures insomnia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;21. Apparently, garden tools make electronic keyboard noises whenever they are used, not just in fights (tell me I&#39;m not the only one who noticed this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simply truth is this film just came out wrong. Period. There isn&#39;t much meat on the bone, nor does it do anything really well. Even average. It&#39;s just bad. However, I&#39;ve seen far worse, and the rake fight scene is pure comedy gold, intentional or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10 - Jaws 4 was worse then this. At least the film never took itself seriously.

hi i am john and i would like to tell you all that my dog was in this film at the baiting screen he was the pit like one, that was going to bite the man chained up. my dogs name was Colin and he stayed away filming for a week for this film. he was also in other things like crime watch uk and some other small parts. he won some dog shows but he has passed away now i miss him he was a great, true and loyal dog and we had some great times together but he got cancer which could not be treated so i had to get him put down that was the worst day of my life i hope this gives you some thing to look for in the film if you watch it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks all

(spoilers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shoulda figured. The dvd didn&#39;t even show the time or how long it was. I thought Wild Cardz was the worst anime movie I&#39;d ever seen. This one is much worse. Makes no sense. Thrown together plot. All so we can see oversized breasts on a figure that doesn&#39;t support them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had to of been a student film. That musta gotten a C grade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 6/10 (until I found out it wasn&#39;t going to end.) the ending made no darn sense&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replayable: 0/10

Walter Matthau and George Burns were a famous vaudeville comedy act, Lewis and Clark, who haven&#39;t spoken in over 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took it personally and has held a grudge ever since. Such is the premise of this hilarious Neil Simon play made into a movie. Of course, what makes it so good is Matthau and Burns in their prime, and the material is funnier than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines as Matthau&#39;s nephew and agent. There&#39;s even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film, and character actor Fritz Feld starts it all off with a &#34;pop.&#34; Rosetta LaNoire, who started out in the 30s in theater with Orson Welles and later was Grandma on &#34;Family Matters,&#34; is great in a small role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with it (and maybe I&#39;m being too picky and/or serious) is the way Matthau treats Burns when they first meet. Granted, he&#39;s had a lot of resentment festering in all these years, but some of the things he does would be considered rude or just plain bad manners taken out of context. Also, I&#39;m used to seeing Matthau act that way in other movies, but not to George Burns. And, Matthau&#39;s bellowing tends to get a little old. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you need a consistently funny film to help and forget your troubles, put in &#34;The Sunshine Boys.&#34; They&#39;ll lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and way of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benjamin: &#34;You have to slide it.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthau: &#34;Wait, wait. I think you have to slide it.&#34;

This movie was quite a mess. There wasn&#39;t anything really going for it. The only character that had any appeal was Bobbie Phillips&#39; Maya and she wasn&#39;t even worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is standard, double-cross the double-crossing double-crosser. With a few too many double crosses to make any sense. Sometimes that means it &#34;keeps you guessing&#34; in this case it &#34;keeps you waiting&#34;. By the end I just wanted everyone to get thrown in jail or shot.

I liked this movie very much. Although this movie doesn&#39;t boast of big (or even known) names, its very charming. Its one of those feel good types where you know that everythings gonna be just fine in the end. My favorite scene is with the baby elephant part. I rate this movie at 7.5

I usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review but in this film there&#39;s really not much to talk of. Just a mish-mash of other FAR better sword &amp; sorcery epics. Lack of cohesiveness runs rampant as does banality. Even the main villaness refusing to wear clothing other then a loincloth is pretty boring as she pretty much has a chest of a young boy.Mildly amusing in it&#39;s ineptitude at best and severely retarded at it&#39;s worst. Lucio Fulci was scrapping the bottom of the barrel here and it shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: D- &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DVD Extras: Posters &amp; Stills galleries; Lucio Fulci Bio; and US &amp; International Theatrical trailers &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Candy: Sabrina Siani is topless throughout (some may consider that appealing, I did not); various extras are topless as well

This is a fabulous film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The plot is a good yarn, and is imaginatively told in a series of flashbacks and alternative points of view. What was deliberate, and what was coincidence? Who is in love with who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You get the chance to put yourselves in the shoes of each of the characters in turn (sometimes literally), and this helps define each character to a satisfying depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With a bit of effort following the twists and turns, you can understand each of the characters; and key events in the film are reshot from the point of view of different people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Take the opportunity if it comes again to your arthouse cinema; it looks good on the big screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; More than keeping you guessing, the plot twists to such an extent that you just sit and watch what unfolds - I defy anyone to predict!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But more likely you will need more than one viewing - I saw this at the pictures on its original release three times, and it got better each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The acting was very good, with a standout performance by Romane Bohringer as Alice torn in three directions by the three other characters in the ensemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A classic. The second-best film of the 1990s.

There&#39;s some nice scenery to look at here,if you can keep your eyes open long enough to see any of it.I&#39;m a big fan of slice-of-life movies,but these people are just plain bland.Although there&#39;s nothing political here,the entire film can be looked at as a political statement,in that it shows how Communism destroys the individual,making everyone the same bland animal that just spends its life sleeping,eating,and occasionally making love.

This 1973 remake of the classic 1944 Billy Wilder film, &#34;Double Indemnity,&#34; is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script. This grade-B TV fodder also illustrates the folly of remakes in general. While Hollywood has gone after greedy executives that colorize black-and-white films and sought disclaimers on wide-screen movies that are shown in pan-and-scan versions, the industry has ignored the hacks that insist on taking a classic film and diminishing it with a shoddy remake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step in producing a bowdlerized version of a classic is to edit the script. The Billy-Wilder-Raymond-Chandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a specified time-slot with room for commercials. Then update the production with bland, color photography, smart, upscale sets, and TV-familiar actors. Thus, the brand-new &#34;Double Indemnity&#34; eliminates the atmospheric black-and-white film-noir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original. Gone are the dusty, shadowy, claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists&#39; desires to escape their situations at whatever cost. Gone are the close bond between Keyes and Neff and the erotic attraction between Neff and Phyllis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look of Jack Smight&#39;s take on &#34;Double Indemnity&#34; is more &#34;Dynasty&#34; than film noir. Phyllis Dietrickson has a designer home to die for, and Neff&#39;s comfy pad would be hard to afford on an insurance salesman&#39;s salary, not to mention the sporty Mercedes convertible that he drives. Neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a paltry $200,000. If not money, then perhaps murder for love or lust? Not in this version. Richard Crenna shows little interest in Samantha Eggar, and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister. Crenna fails to capture the cynicism of Neff, and his attempts at double-entendre and sexual suggestiveness fall horribly flat. Eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind. Only Lee J. Cobb manages a creditable performance as Keyes. Director Jack Smight and his three principals have all done much better work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no conceivable reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule. There was no conceivable reason to resurrect this dud on DVD and package it with the original film except to fill out a double-disc package. The only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting, lackluster direction, and TV grade production values. The 1973 &#34;Double Indemnity&#34; should be titled &#34;10% Indemnity,&#34; because viewing it only underscores the 100% perfection of the original movie.

This review may contain some SPOILERS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when you thought they didn&#39;t make them so extremely bad anymore, along comes Rae Dawn Chong as a space vixen and Willie Nelson as a Native American witchdoctor! It&#39;s even worse when you factor in that these two are the BETTER aspects of `Starlight,&#39; a film that should only be viewed for laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chong is an alien sent to Earth to seek out the only remaining half-breed, part man and part alien. Apparently, the Earth is in dire straits. Something is wrong with the genetics of mankind, and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland. Only by duplicating the DNA of the half-breed can the kindly alien race save the planet. Don&#39;t ask me how that is, since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution, which is caused by humans. You would think Earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures, not saving them! Anyway, the half-breed turns out to be Billy Wirth, a man living in a small Southwestern town and is part Native American from his mother&#39;s line, despite the fact that his mother is a red-headed Caucasian and his grandfather is Willie Nelson. Wasn&#39;t this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic Carmen Electra bomb `The Chosen One&#39; such a howler? Chong arrives in her ship just as Wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend. Before you can say utter the word `hogwash,&#39; Chong is revealing her secret to Wirth, who isn&#39;t surprised for a moment, and spreading the word to Wirth&#39;s family. Chong also makes pals with Wirth&#39;s mother, who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years. Well, this is because Wirth&#39;s father was an alien that abandoned her. Of course, he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to Earth for Wirth so he can use Wirth&#39;s DNA to make the people of Earth his slaves. (Huh?) His laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture Wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie. Not only are they boring, but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ideas might be nice on paper, but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity, particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien. But the effects are the bane of the movie. The opening scene involves Chong on her spaceship, communicating with her superior, someone who we do not see but that Chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light. They use no spoken words, but telepathy, so we are treated to subtitles. Trouble is, both Chong and her superior&#39;s subtitles both look alike, and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually `speaking&#39; at any given moment, which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish. The spaceship is the worst effect to come out of Hollywood this side of an Ed Wood film. Now, I am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this, but these effects really got to me. The most offensive was the most simple one: a fake night sky. The stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone. Most notably are the moments where Chong tells someone she comes from Pleiades, and we get a shot of the seven stars. Thing is, the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie, but any stargazer knows that Pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations Perseus and Taurus, and the cluster doesn&#39;t take up much room in the sky at all. These effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment. Be careful, for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have Willie Nelson turn into a human spotlight and . . . Oh, it has to be seen to be believed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starlight, star bright; Last star I see tonight; I wish I might, I wish I may; not have to watch any more of this trash today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zantara&#39;s score: 1 out of 10.

&#34;Icky Flix&#34; is an excellent starting point for anybody with even a vague interest in the Residents. Most of their classic videos are present (although &#34;Earth vs. Flying Saucers&#34; and &#34;Don&#39;t Be Cruel&#34; are curiously missing), and the &#34;concentrates&#34; of their various CD-ROM projects offer tantalizing glimpses into how the orbed ones have been spending their time since they realized MTV was no longer putting them in heavy rotation (or, indeed, showing videos period).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the videos on this compilation feature striking imagery and idiosyncratic music (with a choice of the original tracks and newly-recorded ones). And two of them -- &#34;The Third Reich &#39;n&#39; Roll&#34; and &#34;One Minute Movies&#34; -- are in the Museum of Modern Art&#39;s permanent collection. Check out this DVD and find out why.

With Al Jolson at the height of his popularity and Warner Brothers&#39;s the Jazz Singer having been the highest grossing film of 1927, it was inevitable that the other studios would churn out a few vehicles for their own Jolson-esquire characters. But while the Jazz Singer was a sensation for its being the first part-talkie, the Matinée Idol lacks the singing voice of its star (the now obscure Johnnie Walker), and has to make do with just his visual antics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Matinée Idol was an early directorial assignment for the renowned Frank Capra. Capra&#39;s first couple of full-length features for Harry Langdon reveal a very showy, excessive style, which made Langdon&#39;s already mediocre slapstick almost unwatchable. A couple of pictures later and Capra has learnt to ease off a bit, with some fairly regular and decent camera-work. However he still shows no aptitude for shooting physical comedy. The longest comic routine - the stage performance - seems to have a few good gags, but it&#39;s all cut up into lots of different camera angles, and there is no chance for the comedy to flow naturally from the performances. Theoretically, a good portion of the jokes are in the intertitles, but there are far too many of these and none of them is especially funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, Capra would eventually mature into a fine dramatic and romantic director, and you can see him beginning to develop in this respect. He cuts down the line, closing in on Walker and Bessie love in the scene where she first lays eyes on him in his Don Wilson get up, neatly establishing the wordless connection between them. Then there is some beautiful and tender framing of the couple in their scene together at the masquerade, which is all very reminiscent of the love scenes in Capra&#39;s early 30s output.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johnnie Walker, Columbia&#39;s answer to Al Jolson, is not an exceptional talent. His comic timing is good but there is nothing to make him stand out. Bessie Love on the other hand is a pretty good actress too, with a very expressive face. Kudos to her for getting involved with the physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys. There&#39;s also a good role for Lionel Belmore, that rotund and jolly character actor who seems to turn up in absolutely everything in the late 20s and early 30s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Matinée Idol is one of those pictures that has gained more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director later having made a handful of masterpieces. In and of itself it is a very uninteresting piece, and like most of Capra&#39;s work before he met Robert Riskin, a disappointment.

I didn&#39;t expect a lot when i went out to see this, but my god what a disappointment. The original was kind of fun within it&#39;s genre, but this is so bad, i felt abused when i left the theater. There&#39;s no plot, it&#39;s not funny, it&#39;s not enjoyable to watch, it&#39;s straight out embarrassing. After an hour i hoped my patience would be rewarded but now i regret not leaving the theater. Do yourself a favor and ignore this one, see it when it comes to the small screen. Or see it on budget DVD, whatever you do don&#39;t waste any money on it. Don&#39;t say i didn&#39;t warn you.

This movie has been made by one of the most absurd humorists in Canada, Yves P. Pelletier. I was shocked for a second that he made a ROMANTIC comedy, but knowing he was a heavy cinephile, was seen in every local festival and in the local cinematheque, I had a positive feeling about this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hell, I was right. Right off the bat, the scenario (written by Pelletier himself) is a bit twisted and hard to follow, but, in Pelletier&#39;s fashion it&#39;s a one-of-a-kind 90 minutes jack-in-the-box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loosely inspired and mostly transformed allusion to Dangerous Liaisons (by Laclos) &#34;Les Aimants&#34; consists of a twisted game of writing notes on the fridge. Throughout the movie you&#39;ll get the occasion to find out who&#39;s who and who&#39;s writing to who on that goddam fridge....which pops up in an interesting love affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great storyline, great photography, great quotations of other movies. Should we ask more for a first movie?

Powers Booth is hypnotic as cult leader jim jones who led his Peoples Temple followers from 1953 until 1978 when he led them in a mass suicide in 1978 where over 900 died. A very well done movie which may seem a little dated due to the 70s time period but well worth the time 8 of 10

The season finale sent mix messages, I felt feelings of joy, and also feelings of being lied to and deceived. Roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire season nine was a lie because her husband, Dan, had died. She also admits the family never won the lottery, and what season 9 was a lie just being how she wished or wanted it to be. I&#39;m still confused about when she said Becky ended up with David, and Darlene with Mark because Becky and Mark admit to being pregnant. So I believe that is just how she wanted it to be, but it wasn&#39;t. So the season finale was good, but sent mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the show. :)

I watched this movie the night it premiered on MTV. Usually to me MTV Movies are kind of stupid but this one was so good. Summer Phoenix is an amazing actress and I thought that Nick Stahl was good too. If MTV started showing more movies like this I would probably enjoy the channel a lot more.

I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the film has stuck with me through the years. It&#39;s not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting, it&#39;s about the educational purpose, and the message behind that is the most important. It&#39;s not a sin to have a child when you&#39;re a teenager and still in high school, and it&#39;s not really a bad thing, either, but it is a problem. Tons of girls I knew are all having children now, and I guess they never watched this great movie, and if they did, they clearly didn&#39;t get the message behind it all. It&#39;s about not taking chances when you&#39;re in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. It&#39;s not a myth. You don&#39;t necessarily lose out on your dreams, but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie has a clear message behind it: JUST SAY NO!

God! Where do I begin? From start to finish, I could not help to hate this movie. Vines? Vines that make cell-phone noises?! Oh yeah, I&#39;m so scared - I&#39;m going to rid the weeds of earth! Come on people! The plot went nowhere, When the group discovered the ruin, and the village people (no pun intended) came to warn them and brandished weapons in front of their faces, don&#39;t worry, Amy (Jena Malone) was there to take pictures! That whole scene really had me wondering why she didn&#39;t take pictures of her beau, Jeff (Johnathon Tucker), sawing off Mathias (Joe Anderson) legs. When the idiots first threw down the rope after Mathias, how the rope was at least ten feet from the ground, but how it eventually was able to be a mere two to four feet from the ground. I cannot begin to cover everything that was wrong about this movie, there is just too much to cover. I will say the graphics as far as the gore were terrific, but it amounted to nothing since the acting and script were so terrifically bad.

Oh so beautiful, oh so tearful and so gut-wrenching. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes everything seem so superficial, so pale, so meaningless in comparison. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sister Helen is not a real saint. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a real human - flawed, raw and blunt, but passionate and with a heart of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found most interesting is that this handful of wretched, miserable people found meaning and laughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I loved most is how the documentary portrayed the polarity of human nature.

This documentary follows the lives of Big and Little Edie Beale, a mother and daughter, who lived as recluses in their family mansion in East Hampton, NY from the mid-50s through the late 70s. By the time the filmmakers find them, the mansion is falling apart, and the women, one 78 and the other 56, share a squalid room. The older Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the younger is her first cousin. The women were originally going to be evicted from the house due to its decrepit condition, but Jackie sent them money for repairs so they could keep living there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At times this movie can seem exploitative, as neither woman seems in the best of mental health, but at other times, the movie is hard to look away from. &#34;Little&#34; Edie blames her mother for her current state, and her mother fires back that Edie was never going to be the success she thought she was. &#34;Little&#34; Edie often seems trapped in the past, focused on choices she made decades ago, and loves showing off pictures from her youth, where she clearly was a beautiful debutante. Her mother seems more resigned to her fate, to live out the rest of her life in terrible conditions. There are definite hints of the glamorous life both women once lead, from the pictures that show a happy family, to the grand portrait of the older Edie next to her bed. From what we see of the house, most of the rooms in it are empty, the walls are cracking and falling apart, and &#34;Little&#34; Edie leaves food in the attic for the racoons to feast on. And of course there are numerous cats running around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At its heart, this documentary is incredibly sad. While neither woman seems particularly depressed by their lot in life, the squalor they live in is utterly awful. It&#39;s not particularly clear if there is even running water in the house, and you get the impression that they have essentially been abandoned by their family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as a documentary, the film is a wonder to behold, and is highly recommended.

A film that reveals the unease of modern men and women in life when confronted to death. We are beyond the simple religious belief in the afterlife, and what&#39;s more in any kind of hell or heaven. Religion is declared dead. Yet human beings are more obsessed than ever by death, especially since we can push it away for quite a long time. What&#39;s more the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. That was quite typical of the end of the 20th century. Today things are changing, especially when the president of the United States himself, Barack Obama, in a public speech to journalists speaks of their search for truth and qualifies that truth as being of course relative because it is more a quest than a final end, objective or achievement. The film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thinking that was starting to evolve into a truth obsession, an obsessive conception that truth was unique and irreversibly reachable. Post modernism had not reached Hollywood yet, though today it seems to have reached the White House. So some young doctors and medical students decide to go into death and come back. Technically it is possible but the result is not surprising. It reactivates old guilty feelings and frustrations that had been buried into the unconscious. One has to do with a drug addicted father of a Vietnam veteran who commits suicide, another with a young boy who was stoned to death by some others the death tripper included, another still with a young black girl who was victimized and bullied in grade school out of racism, sexism and hatred if not fear in front of her shyness. It is so naïve that you could cry out of shame for these young adults who are highly qualified and behave like babies who are crying for their bottles of edulcorated fruit juice. The film though is interesting but in something quite different. The setting and the shooting and every single detail or treatment of any detail is baroque, morbid, decadent, quite in the style of &#34;Death in Venice&#34; or Greenaway, or some other works of art that deal with making friends with the basic enemy that death is. Of course that does not save the film but at least that makes it worth watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID

To start out with, the script is immitative and inane. The characters are shallow and formulaic. The plot has arbitrary reversals and non sequitors. Baldwin&#39;s direction is terrible -- these actors could do better on their own. The jokes and wisecracks fall flat. The shoot out scenes are clumsy and incredible. Baldwin directs himself as the wise courageous hero but spends most of his time in power struggles with women, particularly with the caricatured repressedwoman in their tunnel team who is always asking for and denying reassurance. The conductor suffer from absurd incompetence, being unable to effectively employ a pistol he has come by.Anomalies: a hooded man bristleing with guns stalks through a railroad car, startling people. The next time we see them they are going about their business sitting in their seats, talking, eating, reading, knitting.In the New York subways folks sometimes come on the train to do some musical or dramatic number --- maybe that&#39;s what they thought the &#34;happening&#34; was.

This kind of &#34;inspirational&#34; saccharine is enough to make you sick. It telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth. It removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it. The big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car; I guess you&#39;d need such prompting to feel if you&#39;re stupid enough to watch a film as simple-minded and sappy as this. Streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it&#39;s just that---a display, switched on and off like a light. Because I can&#39;t for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film. Even though it&#39;s based on a true story, and an inspirational one at that I&#39;m sure, the set-up, execution and performances play like a third-rate TV movie or half-witted high school drama.

again such kind of zero-budget digital-video cam trash. and again I fell into this trap cuz the title had &#34;zombie&#34; in it (german title: ZOMBIE ATTACK!) the story: on halloween some people visit the &#34;museum of the dead&#34;, it&#39;s a trap, a crazy doctor wants to kill the people, everything connected to some aztec-cult. so they fight against some zombies in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ultra cheap scenery: some corridors with black tape on it. a few dilettantish drawings and a few skulls as you can find them in every fun-shop. no actors, just low-grade models waking around with absolutely no idea what to do. no effects. laughable make-up, your local hobby-make-up-zombie-fan will do it better, some time it looked as if they had not enough money for enough colour, otherwise they just could not do it like this, man, they have to realize the looks of their &#34;zombies&#34;. some laughable martial-arts fights with the zombies, slow-motion. just, when the director wants to have it scary he uses some standard digital-video-cam effect where everything is flackering. unbelievable! 0 out of 10!

So many fans, so little to show for it. I know, I know, these words are gonna find me in a great minority. A lot of people really liked Good Will Hunting. But seriously please, great film making, not even close, and let&#39;s put the blame where it belongs... in the writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I know they won an oscar for it, and boy did they look good emoting on the screen. But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with lots of cursing in it, and a slightly bigger budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this movie does show, is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take manure, feed it to you, and make you believe your eating bon bons. And that&#39;s exactly what the studio did with the film. They created such high faluttin buzz around it, that people believed, and wanted to believe it so much --- that they saw brilliance where there was none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I know some people think it&#39;s a great movie, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a horribly bad movie, I like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies, and also to some great Made for TV movies (although, not HBO films, HBO films are unusually better than Good Will Hunting would ever be.) It&#39;s just a nice, little film, with some good performances, Robin Williams was not good in it, they just gave him the oscar cause the&#39;d been itching to do it for a while. And of course, the Miramax public relations machine secured Ben and Matt their screenwriting oscar... but come one people... there&#39;s better movies out there thatn GWH.

Like most people, I was interested in &#34;More&#34; solely because of the Pink Floyd soundtrack, which has turned out to be the only Pink Floyd album that I still listen to after all these years. It was quite a surprise to run across the film in a local video store, in a digitally remastered version. It was an even bigger surprise to find that it is a pretty good movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visually it is quite beautiful, especially when the two main characters are cavorting on the rocks on the Spanish island of Ibiza. And the use of the soundtrack music, which as far as I can tell is exclusively by Pink Floyd, is excellent. It was a joy to watch the film with my copy of the album alongside me, mentally ticking off each track as it was used in the film. Dave Gilmour&#39;s brief &#34;A Spanish Piece&#34; was the only one I didn&#39;t hear, and several tracks are used quite prominently, especially &#34;Cymbaline,&#34; &#34;Main Theme,&#34; and &#34;Quicksilver.&#34; That latter track is tedious on the soundtrack album but works very well during the title sequence of the film, resurfacing at least once later on. Maybe now I can appreciate it on the album, now that I have some visuals to accompany it in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot of &#34;More&#34; is a little hard to take at times, especially in the early going, when the film appears to be merely a vehicle to demonstrate the hipness of those involved in making it. But eventually the film proves that it has much more than that to offer, as the plot becomes more focused. Why does Stefan take heroin? Why does ANYBODY take heroin, fully knowing the possible consequences? The film does not attempt to answer that question directly, but Stefan&#39;s heroin use seems a logical extension of his single-minded pursuit of pure pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this film to any Pink Floyd fan who has an appreciation of the vastly underrated &#34;More&#34; soundtrack. I also recommend it to anyone who has an interest in sixties counterculture and how it was portrayed in the media. I have no idea how realistic this movie is, since I am too young to have experienced the sixties firsthand, but it does seem to capture the spirit of the times in a way that no other movie does.

I had high hopes for this production, being one of my favourite works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, a lot of it is reasonable: Helen Baxendale is not a bad Lady Macbeth, but lacks the devilry which the original character is infused with. Many of the minor characters do well, and the Scottish settings are superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big disappointment to me is Jason Connery in the title role: he seems to be reading his lines off a cue card with the wrong glasses - surely for the first time, as well. He can do so much better. Any production when compared to the sublime Ian McKellen (Macbeth 1979)who to my mind gave the gold standard performance, is going to struggle to be appreciated, but I actually fell asleep and had to rewind this one before I could get through it - hardly a great sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, one to Avoid.

I caught this movie a few years ago one night, and it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. However, since it is supposed to be an action movie, I cannot give it more stars since the humor was unintentional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chuck Norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the road to see his family, and within the first five minutes the conflict arises which leads Chuck to seek vengeance for the rest of the film. Good thing too, &#39;cuz the sub-par acting by everyone involved was starting to get old very fast. Actually, the judge was pretty good, but I can&#39;t really describe what makes him work, you&#39;ll have to check it out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the custom van Chuck Norris drives is hideously classic!

When I began watching I thought I was watching some pro-Koresh amateur documentary. However, I had never seen 3/4 of the footage they used. They interviewed people saying that the FBI/ATF instigated all these things, which sounded so far fetched, but then followed in up with FBI video and testimony. I was amazed. The documentary followed up with the senate investigation after the fire, and after seeing the interview and video footage you will be shocked at how the Senate and Attorney General turn their backs on Davidians basically to cover up the aggression by the FBI/ATF. If you start watching this you must finish it. Otherwise you will think it is propaganda of something like that.

A total and absolute waste of time. Bad acting. Bad story. Predictable. Simple. Pathetic. After a while I was only watching to see what happens, since I&#39;d already invested my time into it. Totally surprised Mrs Forlani played in a weak movie as this. Honestly - just don&#39;t bother. A total and absolute waste of time. Bad acting. Bad story. Predictable. Simple. Pathetic.

How many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us, I suspect. Shall we dance? is not a movie about dancing. It is about learning about ourselves, recognising what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day Mr Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy. he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons. He is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule. He hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a hilarious scene in the mensroom at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are interrupted practising some dance steps. There are many other funny and warm-hearted scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is not a fairytale, but it leaves the viewer feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie helped me to understand the Japanese people a little better. It is a warm and very worthwhile film to see.

Richard Widmark is a tainted character in this movie. He is a professional pickpocket. He&#39;s been in prison three times, yet at the beginning of the film, he tries to make it four. Thelma Ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody. Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a period piece during the McCarthy era where the Red Scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite nicely. What is unusual about this film is that Peters &amp; Ritter are both victims of violent beatings in an era where women were seldom more than sex objects in films. This is what makes this film noir as women often got different roles in this type of film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by Fox as the under card for double features in the theater. The sets show it is a limited budget film. The script made J Edgar Hoover mad because patriotism is given short shrift. Hoover wanted it changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, it became a B under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953. The script &amp; acting in it are better than other big features were that year.

I have to admit I have a particular penchant for the humor and story telling style of British movies, though not all of course, succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film made me think, and left me in the end with a quiet smile on my face. Its about character development and relationships, truth and lies, and whether love is sometimes simply not enough. Some very nicely understated acting from all the participants, especially the two leads, Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a lot of fuss made about Gosford Park, but with this piece I feel Fellowes has actually produced a better movie, though it has not been a mainstream release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An intelligent mature story about real people who are undeniably flawed, but also capable of acts of genuine graciousness.

What&#39;s up with this movie? Does Mr. Lyne and his writers think that a sado-masochistic fling between two screwed up Yuppies can carry a feature length movie? Maybe if it had some comedic elements (which is doesn&#39;t, at least intentionally), or there were some additional dramatic elements (which there are not), or maybe if it was hardcore. No, it&#39;s simply the history of the affair; a chronology of a bunch of R-rated trysts. Ho-hum, who cares? &#34;Nine ½ Weeks&#34; deserves every Razzie nomination it got. It&#39;s a loser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way, what&#39;s up with Roger Ebert and his rave review? Where was his head back in 1986?

Who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accidental killing of a security guard... characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them... and better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A red toolbox of death? Please....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hypothermic weak thugs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting from hell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy, thriller, voyeurism and... female ... (uhm) Rambo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable and it&#39;s an insult to any thinking person. Do not watch, walk away it&#39;s more horrible than you may imagine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on top of it all it&#39;s trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it&#39;s violence...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs Montford: Shoot &#39;Em Up was fun and funny, this is just pathetic and terrible. Good luck next time. :-(

Having not seen all the films released in 2002, I can&#39;t say that this is the best film of the year. I can say that it is the best film I have seen all year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most American films featuring black people either obsess over the American preoccupation with &#34;race relations&#34;, or fall into the cliches of the inner city ghetto, with every sterotype imaginable spouting ebonic-phrased slang. Antwone Fisher stands proudly alone in this regard: race is irrelevant, save for one fight that may, or may not, have been provoked by a racial slur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antwone Fisher&#39;s story is one that should find resonance with any empathic individual. He is understatedly, and thoughtfully, portrayed by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, while obviously using his star power to have the film made, sticks to the background for the most part, and allows the film to be the Antwone Fisher story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a time when BET, and popular culture in general want to maintain the ghetoization of a large number of Americans (and Canadians too, you know), this is a film that speaks to the humanity in all of us. I just hope that the non-Black audience will go see this film for that humanity, rather than avoiding it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the movie whom they can identify with. That would be a sad commentary on race-relations in North America in and of itself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

First a quick &#39;shut up!&#39; to those saying this movie stinks. You can&#39;t go to every movie expecting &#39;Citizen Kane&#39;. This was actually a fun movie. Jason Lee is good in everything he does. The only flaw in this movie is, I don&#39;t think there was enough chemestry between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should have dwelled more on that. Other than that, the movie is good fun. Selma Blair needs to eat something. She&#39;s worrying me. But she still looks beautiful. So yes, I recommend this movie for a date or light saturday afternoon fun. Go see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RATING: **1/2 out of ****

Pretty awful but watchable and entertaining. It&#39;s the same old story (if you&#39;ve lived through the 80s). Vietnam vets fight together as buddies against injustice back in the States. A-Team meets Death Wish, my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time goes on, the soldiers go home, and years later a friend is in trouble. No, wait -- in fact, the friend is dead and it is his dad that&#39;s in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, is killed by an exceedingly horrifying (super pointy) meat tenderizer as he tries to defend his father&#39;s small store from the local &#34;protection&#34; gang despite being wheelchair bound from the war. Desperate for help, the father talks to Sarge, the leader of Joey&#39;s old unit from Vietnam, when Sarge shows up for the funeral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and the old gang saddles up for the city. You can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that drove me crazy is that Sarge keeps haranguing his men about planning, and about how they&#39;re really good at what they do when they plan ahead. But Joey wouldn&#39;t have been put in a wheelchair by a gunshot in Vietnam in the first place if the unit hadn&#39;t been messing around! Then when things are going really well in the city as they battle the gangs, they do it again. For no reason at all, they completely bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present. Phh!!!! I raise my hands in disgust. Foolishness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a suspicious moment when all present members of the unit make sure to try out the heroin they snatch from the gang to make sure it&#39;s real. EVERY single one of them. Hmm....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are you going to do? Keep watching, I guess. The movie isn&#39;t too horrible to watch, but it IS a tease. There are all these climactic moments when nothing actually winds up happening. The most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the movie -- the explosives in Vietnam, Joey&#39;s death battle, and the gang brutally kicking an innocent teddy bear aside (poor Teddy!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my main beef with this movie is that I feel let down by it. Even the confusing subplots with &#34;mystery helpers&#34; and their bizarrely cross-purpose motives wasn&#39;t enough to save it at the end. But someday maybe it&#39;ll all come right and they&#39;ll make a sequel. Ha ha ha ha!!!

Alfred Hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of:he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main subject of this Bullock vehicle ,all the ideas,almost everything was already in Hitchcock&#39;s classic &#34; Rope&#34;:the two students who commit a gratuitous crime, Nietsche&#39;s philosophy,and the clues that the boys disseminate ,the Master was the first to transfer them to the screen.And with an eighty-minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Murder by numbers &#34; does not take place in a single room,like &#34;the rope&#34; ,mind you.And ,what a supreme originality,it pits two cops against the evil youngsters;and ,you would never guess it,these two cops are very different:actually,Bullock plays the part of woman living like a man ,and her partner (Chaplin) is as shy as a clueless girlie.The two boys&#39; performances are not really mind-boggling ,not as good ,as ,say ,that of Edward Norton in &#34;primal fear&#34; .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well,you know ,&#34; Rope&#34; was so good ....

STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Dial (Wesley Snipes) is hiding out on his ranch in Montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist. Then he&#39;s approached by the agency again to travel to London to have another go. His target has been apprehended there and is under heavy police protection- but they don&#39;t want him merely to capture their man- they want him taken out. All goes well but then the mission gets botched and when a senior police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, the blame falls at Dial&#39;s feet. Hunted like an animal, he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who&#39;s dealing with issues of her own and becomes his unwitting sidekick as he goes about clearing his name and working out who betrayed him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This latest Snipes straight to DVD escapade came out of nowhere, with a minimal of publicity even for something so small time (I don&#39;t recall seeing any advertisements or trailers for it anywhere.) With this in mind and after Snipes&#39;s history of duff DVD efforts, this might have seemed like one which Snoop Dawg would tell you to drop like it&#39;s hot. But I felt compelled to give it a go anyway. It doesn&#39;t rank among his worst, but it doesn&#39;t reach any higher than the standards of some of his better ones (The Detonator, 7 Seconds, says it all, really), either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, at best, mildly suspenseful, with a minimal of action, naff all in the way of cool dialogue and Snipes not exactly at his best in the lead role. Likewise, in a main supporting role, it&#39;s quite clear Dance has only showed up for the pay cheque as well and this is generally one that none of the cast are going to shout for the hills about on any of their CVs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says a lot that by the end the only &#39;contract&#39; that&#39;s keeping you interested is when Snipes&#39;s will end with Sony and with it an end to any further sub par EL DVD action films. **

This movie was astonishing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary, and the acting spectacular. At first I thought this wasn&#39;t going to be that great because of a summary, but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie, it struck me that I was dead wrong. I literally cried about four or five times in this movie, and despite this, I must&#39;ve watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week! No, the song scenes were not as awesome as they could&#39;ve been, but the plot is what really gets you. American or Asain, I would recommend this to anyone--and I have now. I guarantee that after seeing this one, you&#39;ll get the best out of it, and its plot. I hope you feel the same, and write a rave review too!

Arising from characters previously developed in a series of much-lauded shorts, THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT is about as far from run-of-the-mill &#34;family fare&#34; as you can get: beautifully crafted and with witty dialogue and clever concepts, this really is a movie that will appeal to almost every member of the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story concerns Wallace and his dog Gromit, who live in a village obsessed with growing large vegetables for the annual fair and who operate &#34;Anti-Pesto,&#34; a humane solution to all those pesky rabbits that torment passionate gardeners everywhere. The business is a great success--but Wallace proves a bit too clever for his own good. When he tries to &#34;rehabilitate&#34; rabbits from their vegetable-crunching ways, he unexpectedly unleashes an ancient horror of legendary proportions: the Were-Rabbit! And suddenly no vegetable in town is safe! The movie is full of crazy inventions, unexpectedly smart dialogue, and references to everything from KING KONG to THE WOLF MAN--more than enough to entice even a jaded teenager--but the real charm of the thing is in its characters. The amount of personality the artists and animators can wring from bits of clay is amazing: they seem as fully alive as any flesh-and-blood actor. The DVD release (and I recommend the widescreen) includes a number of informative and entertaining extras as well. Greatly recommended! GFT, Amazon Reviewer

Though this movie is cheesiness at its best, it is pulled off perfectly. This movie, without a doubt, has to be considered a modern classic. There are basically two kinds of movies I like - movies with depth (chick flicks, if you must - I blame my wife for this) and mindless comedies where I can sit back and relax. This movie is a perfect example of the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release. Considering me to somewhat shallow, he said to me, &#34;You&#39;ve got to see this movie. It&#39;s just your type of movie.&#34; Foregoing the insult, I started watching. I know they mentioned The Ramones a million times, but when you actually see them, I said, &#34;Hey, it is The Ramones.&#34; My friend replied, &#34;I don&#39;t know they were a real band.&#34; I had my moment of glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie, though now somewhat dated, is a must see for Ramones fans - or anyone else for that matter.

For every fan of coming of age tales, this 3 hour adaptation of the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Waters novel is pure fun. Cinematic nods to Baz Luhrman&#39;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kinetic style, as well as to all those prim and proper period pieces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ever present on the BBC (where you&#39;re likely to have seen almost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;every prominent member of this cast). It&#39;s rather bawdy and over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the top in spots, but that&#39;s just what the novel called for. The cast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is appealing and, in the cases of Anna Chancellor and Hugh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonneville, perfect. In the case of Rachel Sterling, as our heroine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nan, you simply must overlook the fact that she&#39;s far too pretty to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ever be mistaken for a boy and run with it. It&#39;s a fantasy, after all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some fans of the novel may be put out by the various changes in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;character (particularly that of Jodhi May&#39;s character, Florence), but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the changes all work toward the greater good of this teleplay and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;provide an overall high quality entertainment value.

As listed and stated in many previous comments, this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients to its credit. Indeed, more than 20 years after it was originally transmitted, it is still watched, and watched again, and has a huge global fan-following, something which must indicate that the makers of this series undeniably got something right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The root of the series&#39; brilliance and remarkable appeal has however got to be that it rests on wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters  all of which are brought to life by marvellous actors. The characters are wonderful in particular because of their complexity. In contrast to many other Robin Hood adaptations, and indeed many other film and TV-productions in general, the good guys in this series often make mistakes and can be seen to have apparent flaws, while the baddies, although put forward as evil and ruthless, frequently can be understood and even on occasion seem quite sympathetic. This very much makes Robin of Sherwood into a story about multifaceted, REAL people  rather than of good and bad people  something which very much adds to its uniqueness and remarkable appeal. Also, although very much being an action-packed series featuring numerous amazing stunts (which are remarkable in themselves seeing as this was made long before today&#39;s computer animation, green screens, and so forth. Thus, behind every one of those endless guys falling off castle walls, horses, and catching fire, there actually is a real person who at some point DID fall off a castle wall or a horse or catch fire), there is always amazing dialogue going on between the different characters in each episode. In the final analysis, however, it is generally the series&#39; baddies  Nickolas Grace as The Sheriff of Nottingham, Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne, and Philip Jackson as The Abbot Hugo de Rainault  who get the very best lines and who more than often steal the show with their arguments full of wit and cant. &#34;It&#39;s a wedding, not a celebration!&#34; is just one of their many timeless &#34;pearls of wisdom&#34; which seems to follow one through life :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 years after the fact, it is indeed hard to believe that Robin of Sherwood was originally something made for television  and apparently not with a great deal of money  in order to provide fleeting Saturday afternoon amusement for small children in Great Britain. Filmed in beautiful locations, with clever, amazing scripts and featuring remarkable stunts and fantastic actors  many of whom give the performance of their lives in this show  this in numerous ways seems to be more professionally made and have more production value than many a Hollywood film.

Continuing with the exclusive film programme about complicated relationships in some European courts, last night in the Schloss theatre was shown &#34;Anna Boleyn&#34;, a film directed by the great Teutonic film director Herr Ernst Lubitsch. The film depicts the terrible story of the Queen consort of the British King Henry VIII. She was executed by her husband ( well, not exactly, the King ordered the executioners to do his dirty work) not to mention that this marriage caused an important political and religious historical event, the English Reformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film stars Dame Henny Porten, Germany&#39;s first screen superstar during those early years and Herr Emil Jannings, Germany&#39;s fattest actor in that silent era. Both play their characters in a suitable way; Dame Porten as an innocent aristocrat who becomes progressively interested in the power that the court offers her and Herr Jannings as the unscrupulous, whimsical and womanizing British monarch, a character very suitable for this German actor who overacts appropriately, given the extravagance and excessive personality of the character himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the early film period Herr Lubitsch was known for his outstanding costume films, colossal productions with big budgets ( &#34;Anna Boleyn&#34; cost about 8 million marks, a fortune even for this German count ) taking great care in magnificent decors as can be seen during the coronation procession in Westminster Abbey scene which employed 4.000 extras ( idle Germans of that time were used, causing revolutionary workers to create a fuss when German President Friedrich Ebert visited the set during filming).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the spectacle, one of the most important aspect of this and every film of Herr Lubitsch, even during his epic period, is the complex relationship between the main characters. We experience a game of different interests, double meanings, and the complicated art of flirting but what is treated lightly at first ends in tragedy. The importance of those historical facts is brought to bear in an effective way but Lubitsch is really more interested in the changing relationship between Henry VIII and Anna Boleyn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, if you&#39;ll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must take care that one of his fat and rich heiress doesn&#39;t lose her head for this Teutonic aristocrat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/

Peter Watkins&#39; rarely seen Punishment Park is a brutality-laced, uncompromised political weapon set across a never ending desertscape. An unapologetically left leaning anti authoritarian abuse fest, the escapades at first appear to be so over the top militaristic and sickening that it could come off as some distant fantastical dystopian alternate history, one Harry Turtledove would even enjoy. But once we delve deeper in and really pay attention to the abhorrent diatribe spouting out of those presiding over the tent topped tribunal, as well as the shotgun toting guards overseeing the bloody affair, our eyes are truly opened. Suddenly we realize just how prescient Watkins&#39; film-making is, as much of this is the kind of neo-con talking points about youth culture and the legality of divergent thought tossed around by politicians today. Granted, much of it was drivel pouring out then as well, but it really shows us how little has changed, and informs of how, in some ways, we are closer to such a world where Punishment Parks would be a real and frightening operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main players in nearly every scene are seasoned non actors, mostly chosen for their rash political views and desire to get them on camera. This lends an unprecedented heap of authenticity to the entire experience as we never, even for a second, question the reality of all the chaos. Shot documentary style with 16mm film, this appears like a gritty documentation of some despicable government test project that was classified until found years later. At least it appears to have that history to it now, maybe not as much when it was (barely) released. But this gives an added weight to all the proceedings and helps draw you into this incredible not-so-alternate universe of torture for convicted dissidents.

This movie isn&#39;t about football at all. It&#39;s about Jesus/GOD!! It&#39;s the same kind of sappy sanctimonious religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who wrestle for Jesus, or pump iron for Jesus. Yeah, Jesus was totally buffed, liked contact sports, and definitely owned a full set of dumb bells. DUHHH! This movie should have been entitled &#34;Hiking for Jesus,&#34; or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to convert people to Christianity, and to pander to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the lamb. That the title is derived from the Bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his Bible and asking Jesus for help. The recent sports movie &#34;Invincible&#34; was 100 times more inspiring than this was, and Jesus wasn&#39;t even a factor. It was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any broad appeal as an inspirational sports movie is ultimately lost amidst all of the blatant Bible thumping and sanctimonious religious propaganda. One gets the impression that the sole message is the only way you can succeed and make positive gain is if you accept Jesus as your personal savior. But this is simply not true, and is therefore a lie being perpetuated by those who believe that it is true and want everyone else to believe it. The image of the winning athlete thanking Jesus when he wins comes directly to mind. What does he do when he loses? Does he curse Jesus? Of course not! When he loses Jesus isn&#39;t responsible. Jesus is only responsible when he wins. And the logic goes round and round and round, and it ends up exactly where the true believer needs it to be, every time!! I had to hit pause when the scene with the coach receiving a brand new truck came on so I could stop rolling on the floor laughing my ass off and catch my breath. Materialism is not what Jesus taught. I find it odd that most so called &#34;Christians&#34; seem to either forget or ignore this message from their &#34;savior,&#34; especially when I see a Jesus fish on the back of a huge gas guzzling SUV that passes me like I&#39;m standing still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another message this movie implies is that Jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world. The final scene where the insecure and unsure kicker boots a 51 yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a spoon religious red flag on this turkey. I only gave it three stars because the guy who played the black coach could actually act.

After I got done watching this movie I was so upset that I had wasted 2 hours of my life. That&#39;s 2 hours I&#39;ll never get back. Ugh. When you start this you might think &#34;Wow this is really good!&#34; But rest assured that first impressions mean NOTHING. I was so excited about this movie until the dumbest ending I have ever seen. This movie is simply pathetic. The acting is bland, the story line is anything but original and there&#39;s nothing especially unique about this except that it&#39;s the WORST MOVIE EVER!!! DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! WARNING!! DUMBEST MOVIE EVER YOU WILL BE SORRY IF YOU WASTE 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS!!! 1/10

I thoroughly enjoyed Carmen, better than Original Sin (Angelina Jolie &amp; Antonio Bandaras), which share some thematic similarities, and which I also enjoyed very much. I felt the acting was stronger here (Paz Vega displayed a wider range, has more fire; and Sbaraglia was also great). Overall, their acting was more gritty, more believable (less dreamy than Original Sin, and both actors here had less &#39;celebrity status&#39; and &#39;pretty face&#39; to depend on to make the movie work. Vega definitely sizzles, as to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Vincente Aranda has also built a detailed world (again, better than Original Sin) that lets you feel the grime and the daily goings-on of archaic Spain - for example, people unloading goods from a cart on the street, workers changing the candles of the street lamps, all in the background of the action. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst I greatly sympathize with the recent idea of redeeming our femme fatals (like Brian de Palma&#39;s Femme Fatale), Carmen is a poignant, modern take in the tradition of the noir classic Double Indemnity, and is a delightful pleasure to watch. This is another fine example of the triumph of daring European cinema over glitzy and safe Hollywood fare.

i enjoyed this film immensely, due to pungent scenes (humorous as well as ironic, some even &#34;tragical&#34;), believable performances, witty dialogue and a heartfelt rendering of what it´s like or rather c a n be like to be hetero- and/or homosexual &amp; on the lookout for fulfilment of your desires. i´m aware of the paradox here: homo- a n d hetereosexual.... this is something the film tackles on end, but never uses for caricature. if you´re as open-minded as the people seem to have been who made that film, in the end it won´t matter to you if those who lie in each others arms are of the same sex or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;mr. smith&#34; from the matrix gives an admirable turn as a gay houses-salesman with &#34;strange&#34; appetites here, but that´s not the only thing to marvel at. enjoy.....

This film certainly wasn&#39;t very sophisticated. No, the humor was in fact pretty dumb now that I think about it. But, also while I think of it, I did laugh--proving decent comedy doesn&#39;t need to be very deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fatty Arbuckle is the definite star of this short, despite Buster Keaton&#39;s appearing in the film as well. He is the butcher in an old-time grocery store. A lot of silly stuff occurred in the store and I think I laughed the most at the coffee grinder sequence--you&#39;ll just have to see it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, later, Fatty&#39;s girlfriend is forced to go to a girls&#39; school and because he can&#39;t stand to part, he dresses in drag and infiltrates the school. Arbuckle is one ugly woman! So, for silly and unsophisticated fun, see this film. It won&#39;t change your life and is a very slight picture, but it&#39;s also fun.

An interesting companion piece to true documentaries of John C. Holmes. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t deal with what ultimately killed Holmes, and it certainly could have benefited from doing so. Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg got the most praise for this, but I felt the true stars were Julianne Moore as the cocaine-sniffing mother wannabe, Don Cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as pornstar/stereo-salesman in some wild getups and William H. Macy, who&#39;s wife is the ultimate slut. Not to mention a nearly unrecognizable Alfred Molina. Macy&#39;s new year&#39;s eve bash and Cheadle&#39;s chance for a better life after a donut shop robbery gone wildly wrong are probably the two best scenes in the movie, or at least the two best shot. What this movie does best is show how power can easily corrupt in its various forms. However, none of the characters apparently learn anything from their dark downward spiral as they all rebound and return to their normal lives.

Being a wrestling fan, movies about wrestling generally suck (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura story) but this one isn&#39;t the worst I&#39;ve ever seen. Yes its bad but its better than some of the others I&#39;ve mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hulk Hogan stars as basically himself and for some reason, a rival network wants to beat him up because he doesn&#39;t want to be on that network. Let me explain it so everyone can understand....picture USA Network having Rip...and TNT will go to any lengths to get him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this make sense...no? Well don&#39;t feel bad because it doesn&#39;t make sense. Nor does it make sense to have a legit ex con have a REAL fight with Rip at the end of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of this movie makes much sense but compared to other wrestling movies and later Hogan films its not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 out of 10

I followed this entire series when I was a child in grade school, by choice, not because it was required for school. I used to read the plays at the pace of the series. The experience gave me a life-long love for Shakespeare and history. It even gave me a bit of an acting bug, although at an amateur level only. Whenever I read any of Shakespeare&#39;s history plays, the images that come to mind first are from this black and white production, seen on a big &#34;furniture&#34; TV set with a rabbit ear antenna, with all the &#34;ghosts&#34; and wobbles that go with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the sets were minimal, if I remember correctly, that was totally irrelevant because the acting was so good. At the time I had no idea who any of the actors were. Now I see that many of them have become well known over the years. I particularly enjoyed Hotspur and Hal, whom I now see were played by Sean Connery and Robert Hardy. I would dearly love to see this available in video, especially since many of the plays are seldom performed and even fewer are available on video. It would be valuable also as a document of mid-20th century televised play production.

Only one word can describe MR MAGOO - slapstick. Unfortunately this isn&#39;t no AIRPLANE. Looks can decieve, and that&#39;s exactly what MR MAGOO does. Based on the old cartoon, Leslie Nielson plays Magoo, a bumbling near blind man whop stumbles upon a pair of jewel thieves. Now he must hunt them down using...blindness basically. And that&#39;s all this film plays off. The blindness of MR MAGOO. Now maybe if they had some funny jokes involving this, but pretty much it&#39;s just one of those &#34; droopy dumb grin on your face because you&#39;re too ashamed to admit you payed to see this&#34; films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But MR MAGOO isn&#39;t as bad as it&#39;s hacked up to be. It&#39;s at least got some funny jokes, and it&#39;s good wholesome fun for the whole family (Nielson tried to make a &#34;NAKED GUN&#34; for families in MAGOO, but it&#39;s no where near as good as that). So see it once, you might hate it, you might love it, whatever. I personally didn&#39;t hate it, but I sure didn&#39;t like it, or even rate it &#34;okay.&#34; 2/5 stars for MR MAGOO-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JOHN ULMER

I bought this film as I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin &amp; Patsy Kensit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off let me say the acting is not of a high standard. Stephen Baldwin makes his character look almost retarded at times and at other times morose. Patsy Kensit is so-so but not too convincing in some scenes, and the supposed poetry she spouts in a particular scene in her Hotel Room is utterly meaningless rubbish. Ms Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here but ultimately I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this film. Ms Rubins Character is at first innocent, then sexy, as she plays Stephen Baldwin&#39;s Character (Travis)for a fool. The supporting cast includes Adam Baldwin(no relation to his more famous namesakes) &amp; M.Emmet Walsh who has appeared in many films, also I noticed Art Evans who was one of John Mclane&#39;s allies in Die Hard 2. The Movie is decent and there are a few nude scenes with Rubin &amp; Kensit, a bit of action but this is certainly not a fast moving or intelligent thriller. There is a particular scene when they are in the car about to commit a crime and Stephen Balwin&#39;s character is wearing sunglasses and when you see him again, the area around his eyes etc is painted black instead, then the sunglasses reappear later when they are leaving the crime scene and police are in pursuit, a very obvious error in editing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are fans of either of the ladies or either Baldwin then you may find something to like here, but others should steer clear. This is a reasonable but unremarkable thriller and not really worth more than a couple of dollars if you want it.

The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. Fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this, using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s really rather messy though. Fellowes doesn&#39;t seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged. Rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialogue is inconsistent, stagey here, vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional cliché-landmine. Though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can&#39;t create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. There&#39;s also a very prosaic, dare I say it British feel to the filming. I didn&#39;t want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation, I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally it is, in fact, the story which lets the rest down. Just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances and John Warnaby&#39;s ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m disappointed; not that it&#39;s bad, but that it could have been much better. 3/10

This is an excellent film. The aerial scenes were well-done. It was also the right balance of war and love. The film gives meaning to the phrase, &#34;Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.&#34;

A potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak script which throws all credibility out the window leaving the actors very little to work with. Roth covers it up as best he can by being all mouth; Hurt has about as much menace as a fluffy bunny and Stamp can&#39;t seem to decide whether he&#39;s playing an ex-London crook or some toff straight off the playing fields at Eton. As for poor Laura del Sol she does what she can but her character is no more than every northern European&#39;s idea of the stereotypical Latino woman who&#39;s all pouts and hot temperament. If you&#39;re a fan of any of the main actors don&#39;t disappoint yourself or fool yourself (as I suspect many of the other reviewer&#39;s here have done). Watch it by all means but stay critical; you know these guys can do better.

I felt like I was watching the Fast and the Furious again, but with different actors and a little bit different plot. I will say the cars in the film are very cool. So, if you like fast cars, then you will probably find this movie mildly entertaining. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I&#39;ve seen her from Days of our Lives. She is a really good singer, but too bad they gave her such lousy songs to sing in this movie. I mean songs about cars; not exactly what you would here on the radio. Since it is a Hollywood film, you have to give this story a little lee way, but in real life I don&#39;t think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race car, fix a car engine, and be a lead singer. It&#39;s just all very silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another side note, any one willing to wager 25 million on a car race is a nut. But it was kinda of cool at the end when Natasha stops right before the finish line and screws Michael over. Priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for car freaks. So, if you like fast cars, then I&#39;d recommend this.

Brides are dying at the altar, and their corpses are disappearing. Everybody is concerned, but nobody seems to be able to figure out why and how this is happening, nor can they prevent it from happening. Bear with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this, as he is extracting spinal fluid from these young women to transfuse his ancient wife and keep her alive. Continue to bear with me. Finally, the authorities figure out that somebody must be engineering the deaths and disappearances, but of course, they can&#39;t figure out the improbable motive. Let&#39;s just ignore the ludicrous pseudoscience and move on... If you can get through the first twenty minutes of this mess, you will be treated to Lugosi whipping his lab assistant for disrespecting one of the brides he has murdered, explaining that he finds sleeping in a coffin much more comfortable than a bed, and other vague parodies of real horror films (the kind with budgets and plots). Anyhoo - a female journalist follows her nose to the culprit (and remarkably the inept police are nowhere to be seen!), and then the fun really starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography and acting are OK. There are a lot of well dressed, very good looking people in this film. The directing is fair, and the script is a little better than the material deserved. Nevertheless, this film fails to sustain the interest of all but the most hardened b-film fan. The best thing about it.... It does eventually end, but not soon enough.

Watching Fire and Ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year. It wasn&#39;t at all a bad movie, certainly not average, but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and one-dimensional (which, perhaps as based on Frank Miller&#39;s comic book, was the right decision to go with). But its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that jolt of a 14 year old feeling watching beefcake men fighting in bloody sword-led combat, with the occasional freaky creature or super-hot female to go with the painterly surroundings. While I would probably re-watch Fire and Ice before 300 again, they both aroused that similar feeling - the exception this time being, naturally, that it&#39;s Frank Frazetta, the infamous artist and designer of countless paperback books and comics, collaborating with director Ralph Bakshi, in what isn&#39;t typical Hollywood fare but something for the die-hard fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time (it may now be coveted nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their Masters of the Universe VHS tapes back in the day) is the possible cons mentioned before and, maybe, that you will see something somewhat unique. Fire and Ice isn&#39;t even the only Bakshi rotoscoped feature, but it&#39;s possibly the most fluid- if not quite my personal favorite- of the few he made, and he and his team create a whole striking world that&#39;s part pre-historic, part out-of-this-world fantastic, and part medieval, and all touched up with a painters hand with respect to the backgrounds, the skies and grounds. There&#39;s a slight drawback for Bakshi fans in this facet of character design; Bakshi went as far as to say it&#39;s more Frazetta than him. This may be true, but it doesn&#39;t make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we don&#39;t see people killed or gutted in quick or slow motion (my favorite was the momentary skeleton-guide- how they rotoscoped that amazes me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it. If you&#39;re already a die-hard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two warring factions or a &#39;damsel&#39; or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or yada yada, so suffice to say it&#39;s about, well, Fire against Ice, with characters named Nekron and Darkwolf (the coolest male of the lot and most comic-book in appearance) and Teegra (the typical hottie who&#39;s almost *too* perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure). What the plot does do, as an asset, is allow a series of cliffhangers and suspense bits around the action, the progression of the danger in the oncoming big battle, like when the ogres are hunting after Teegra and have to contend with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree trunks and lakes. And per usual for Bakshi, he conjures up some craziness (if not quite his usual inspired lunacy) in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material. If you&#39;ve seen Wizards, you&#39;ll understand what I mean to a lesser extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#39;re an animation buff, seek this out right away for some &#39;old-school&#39; (i.e. 1980s) action and incredible design. For everyone else, it&#39;s... good, not great, as I would say without fault about its logical 21st century extension, with some alterations, 300.

This movie is simply awesome. It is so hilarious. Although the skating and other montages are played out, the comedy is awesome. Raab Himself and Brandon Dicamillo are hilarious. There will be moments when you can&#39;t breath you&#39;re laughing so hard. Plus, there are scenes that you can watch hundreds of times and still laugh. This is one of the funniest comedies I&#39;ve ever seen.

Watching It Lives By Night makes you wonder, just who in the world greenlit this crap. A newlywed couple go spelunking on their honeymoon, get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people. And where exactly are they? They&#39;re in the desert, then they&#39;re skiing, then they&#39;re in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby. The town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against whiny doctor boy. The ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There&#39;s no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with anger. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston did the effects for this movie. I guess you have to start somewhere.

What can i say about this movie that hasn&#39;t been said hundreds of times before? It&#39;s an American Classic. It has spawned dozens of imitators. Or none. Midnight Madness is one of kind. From the ridiculous opening montage/music to the Bonaventure HOtel, I was hooked. Leon made us all feel so young and carefree. One question though, how did he have those two hot hookers with him all the time? And how did have the time/money to arrange such an event? The cast is top notch. David Naughton is at his best here. His tight yellow sweatshirt is disturbing. His little brother Michael J Fox(in his first starring role), is a real brat. There is also Naughton&#39;s love interest and a dork and the obligatory black dude in a fisherman&#39;s hat on the yellow team. Michael J Fox does bad things like try and steal cups of beer at the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery and runs away to Flounder&#39;s van. Flounder&#39;s team gives us the most comedy. What exactly is the deal with the blond on that team? Is she dating Flounder? Or Melio? Or Blade? Yes, the Mexican gentleman&#39;s name is blade. The other guy on the Flounder team has the best lines of the movie, i won&#39;t pomp them here. The Meat Machine team is a bunch of drunks. My personal favorite is Armpit. But the silent black man is great too. The other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians(two of which are 450 lb twins).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the ending from the start. But that doesn&#39;t matter. This is the 80&#39;s me-genre at its finest. Don&#39;t rent this one, BUY it. and Buy it now.

Yes i really found this film distasteful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#39;t like the Sandra Oh character, she really annoyed me. It is unlikely she would be accepted into rural Italian life due to the fact she is non-white. this was a bit of PC nonsense. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the film is also offensive to Italian men. For instance, the one man she (Diane Lane) has an affair is turns out to be a caddish cheat. But guess what: at the end your typically plasticky American brick-head turns up, all cheesy white smile and tan, and she finally finds what she wants all along: a real American man, and now she has colonized another part of the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, this film is quite racist in its depiction of Italians and the way it subjugates them as either smarmy lotharios or backward peasants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the photography was good but the film and its attitude were trash.

When I watch a low budget film I know what to expect. I expect the acting not to be as good (budget reasons), I expect the lighting not to be as good (budget reasons)I expect the sound not to be as good (budget again). Stop judging these low budget movies like a big budget film!!! I&#39;m a filmmaker myself so I understand the budget constraints on a low budget film. Stealing locations, shots etc... the list goes on and on. I don&#39;t want to say all the acting was bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is a natural. Not sold on Carl Washington yet. He has to understand that every line is not important, some are throw away lines. I say if a film makes you want to see what happens next, it&#39;s a good film. I liked this movie. I gave it an 8. I wanted to see what was gonna happen next. Great job Quiroz brothers!

The movie Razor Blade Smile has an interesting title as well as leading role. Now most may not like this movie for the plot and acting was a little cheap, but that is the appeal of a movie like Razor Blade Smile. In a way it was suppose to be bad movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you watch this movie all the way through the end you&#39;ll see it is as I said a cheap vampire flick with a little humor. (Also how they manipulated colours in a few scenes is very interesting.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion this movie is a type you rent and laugh at with your friends and enjoy it for what it is. For no movie is throughly bad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Lilith Silver says: &#34;Humans just don&#39;t smile enough...&#34;

1st movie comment ever! I&#39;ll start with saying &#34;Come on! Wasn&#39;t THAT bad... was it?&#34;... No it was&#39;t that bad actually. I laughed and giggled enough times through the movie so I cannot say with hand on my heart that it was rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s completely different, this and Epic Movie (Epic Movie sucked bad.. doh!). &#34;How so?&#34; people would ask. I&#39;ll tell you how. This movie is not as nearly as pointless, not to mention that the stupid (and I say stupid because it is, but being stupid makes it funny) stuff that happens around and with the characters is actually enjoyable in this movie. Not the best around but hey... what would you expect - look at the poster! Some people said it was stupid, I find that when writing a comment one should be more objective (my own opinion) but yeah, of course it was stupid, it&#39;s a movie about &#34;stupid&#34;! Look, I&#39;m not telling you to go and watch the movie now or else you missed the event of the century. What I am telling is that, if you happen to see the movie somewhere, please don&#39;t carve your eyes on the opening credits. See what it&#39;s all about - who knows, you might like it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4/10 for not being so bad and making me laugh and some unexpectedly good sex-related jokes.

After high-school graduation, best friends Alice and Darlene, decide to take a trip to Thailand. Whilst they are there, they meet a charming Australian guy named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asks them if they want to take a weekend trip to Hong Kong with him. They agree. At the airport though, they are get busted for smuggling drugs and then get convicted for 33 years in a Thai prison for something they say they haven&#39;t done. Not really knowing what to do they end contacting Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. Word has it that if you have the money he can help you. Things start of well, but they still can&#39;t get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is really good because it doesn&#39;t let on what&#39;s going to happen and it&#39;s interesting all the time. I couldn&#39;t believe the ending though. It was one of those endings where you don&#39;t know the 100% truth, but you still kind of know what really happened with Nick and the drug smuggling because of the &#39;owning up&#39; etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both give quite good performances here. Beckinsales performance was a little weak though. Both Danes and Beckinsales characters friendship is good but could of seemed stronger. Paul Walker even has a small uncredited role here. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I give it a 7/10.

The Capture Of Bigfoot is one of the silliest and worst movies of all time. I love Sasquatch and Bigfoot movies but this one is just a sheer waste of one&#39;s time.Terrible, terrible, terrible!I watched this movie last night, and it was all I could do to finish watching.I understood that this weird crazy man wanted to capture Bigfoot,but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie.It did have some amusing parts though.There was this very cheesy and corny disco club with very bad disco dancing that seemed to go on for far too long in the movie.I think the director was trying to fill time.The worst thing was the way the Bigfoot looked.The obvious man in a suit looked like a pink faux fur Bigfoot.It was laughable.If you want to see a very bad Bigfoot movie, then I suggest that you purchase this movie.Personally, I wasted my time and my money on this one!

The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick. Sadly it&#39;s closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements. It starts off with some divers who get attacked and we see a bit of blood, but that&#39;s the only blood in the entire film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Evil Below isn&#39;t the worst around, but for a horror film it is tediously boring. The acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads. There&#39;s a few nightmare sequences where it just seems like the director didn&#39;t know what to do. I manged to sit through it all (just about) but I wouldn&#39;t recommend this film to ANYONE. Horror fans might want a copy for the cool VHS cover, but it&#39;s best left at that.

This is a ripsnorting, old-fashioned adventure yarn. I understand that by today&#39;s political standards, the treatment of the Indians was unacceptable. But this moving isn&#39;t about politics. It&#39;s about action, dialogue, comradery, acting, direction, music, and photography, and it&#39;s marvelous on all these factors. Grant, Fairbanks, and McLaglen are electric together, and Jaffe is superb. This is the ultimate buddy movie.

I just recently saw this movie in hopes of seeing an accurate portrayal of the bloodiest battle of the 20th Century. I got what I had expected and so much more. Just to think I came across this movie by luck, before I had never even heard of it. It&#39;s a German film made in 1993 so I suppose I can&#39;t be surprised that it&#39;s almost completely unknown to the modern American audience. It&#39;s a shame cause this really is a remarkable film, I dare say that its as good if not better then Platoon, Full metal jacket, Apocalypse now, and All quiet on the western front; all of which are iconic war movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1942: World War II is in full swing. Nazi Germany has over run Mainland Europe and parts of North Africa, then Adolf Hitler orders the full scale invasion of the Soviet Union. A fateful move that ultimately dooms Nazi Germany to defeat. In the early stages the invasion goes well and the German Armies conquer large sections of Soviet territory, but a critical battle ensues at Stalingrad, A city that hold great symbolic &amp; strategic value. The battle soon turns into a blood bath of epic proportions, a nightmare for both the German &amp; Russian soldiers fighting. On the verge of taking the city the Germans are suddenly counter attacked by the Russians who end up cutting off the entire German 6th Army inside Stalingrad. To make matters worse, the Russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the Germans. This entire battle is seen through the eyes of a few young German soldiers fighting for survival not only against the Russians and the harsh winter conditions but also against their own Sadistic officers who care only about medals &amp; glory and the generals who have little regard for the average foot soldier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is going to haunt me for a while. The German Soldiers the film concentrates on are so young and naive, then their humanity &amp; sanity are stripped from them and you really do feel sorry for them cause their not the demonic Nazi&#39;s often portrayed in film. Everything they were fighting for is no longer important, and everything they believed in was shattered, and after fighting a gruesome battle against the Russians inside Stalingrad we see them further deteriorate with the onset of Winter causing many to freeze to death. The Battle &amp; Winter scenes were like a horrible nightmare but it also felt so real. It&#39;s amazing, in the beginning we see strapping young men in the prime of their life, and at the end they a shells of their former selves stripped of everything. After witnessing so much carnage these men just loose their will to live on, it was really sad. When there is finally a moment of hope they are betrayed by Hitler who ultimately abandons these men to a horrible death, which is just another one of Hitler&#39;s crimes abandoning the men who fought for him to be slaughtered by the Russians. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good Anti-War film depicts the horrors of war and that&#39;s what this movie does. The battle for the tractor factory sequence Is the closest thing that comes to hell on earth, but that&#39;s really what The Battle for Stalingrad was like. The German &amp; Russian soldiers were depicted with humanity, it was only the bad apples (specifically on the German side) that doomed the men. Bottom line is this film is amazing cause we see how men breakdown physically &amp; emotionally during war. We all have our limits and these men were pushed far beyond their limits in the most deadly battle of our time. What the average foot soldier endured at Stalingrad was beyond imagination. Even if they had survived everything they had seen &amp; done would have scarred them for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stalingrad shows us why War is Hell, and what exactly hell looks like.

Without a doubt, Private Lessons II is the greatest movie I have ever seen. A Japanese import (poorly) translated into English, its a joy to watch. Not much of it makes sense, but that doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s the greatest comedy around without ever being intentionally funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is rare and unavailable on video, but I have caught it a couple of time late, late at night on pay cable. My taped copy has been watched dozens and dozens of times as I slowly, person-by-person, introduce this film gem to the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joanna Pacula plays the tutor/lover to Ken, our hero. (She apparently was just working for her check.) Ken is played by Goro Inagaki, of the Japanese pop band SMAP, who gives it his all and has great hair through out the movie. Stacy Edwards, of &#34;In the Company of Men&#34; fame, shows up in the movie too and is probably happy that she found other film work afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes at least three viewings to sorta figure out what the plot is. On repeating viewing you can enjoy elements like the abnormal amount of vases Ken has in his house (at least 50) or that Ken is wearing a shirt with embroidered husks of corn in the movie&#39;s finale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is predictable, but highly quotable. My friends and I reenact entire scenes. Yes, it sounds like we&#39;re lame losers and we are ... but we&#39;re lame losers who have seen &#34;Private Lessons II.&#34; Be one of ten people in the world who have seen this movie. You&#39;ll thank me for it.

As a former Erasmus student I enjoyed this film very much. It was so realistic and funny. It really picked up the spirit that exists among Erasmus students. I hope, many other students will follow this experience, too. However, I wonder if this movie is all that interesting to watch for people with no international experience. But at least one of my friends who has never gone on Erasmus also enjoyed it very much. I give it 9 out of 10.

We brought this film as a joke for a friend, and could of been our worst joke to play. The film is barely watchable, and the acting is dire. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving a substandard performance. The plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on. It tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just terrible

I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on. It brings back happy times for me. I grow up in a big city in the mid-west. It reminds me of when I was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same. It makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost. The big mama&#39;s of day are under the age of 55. Will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other. I hope that I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past. The music was great in this movie. I truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters I would have paid to see it. As I viewed the movie for the second time I figured out who life this movie was about. He did an superb job in writing and producing this film. I guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you. As soon as I can I will be obtaining a copy for my home use. I alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than. Thanks for such a great movie.

Brilliant actor as he is, Al Pacino completely derails Revolution  his Method acting approach is totally ill-suited to the role of an illiterate trapper caught up in the American War of Independence. Much of the blame should be attributed to director Hugh Hudson (yes, the man who made Chariots Of Fire just a couple of years earlier  talk about a come-down!!). One of the many jobs of a director is to marshal the actors, coaxing believable performances from them, but in this case Hudson has allowed Pacino to run amok without asking for restraint of any kind. It&#39;s not just Al&#39;s career-low performance that hinders the film though: there are numerous other flaws with Revolution, more of which will be said later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Illiterate trapper Tom Dobb (Al Pacino) lives in the north-eastern region of America with his son Ned (Sid Owen/Dexter Fletcher). He leads a simple life  living off the land, raising his son, surviving against the elements. The country is lorded over by the English colonialists, but during an eight year period (1775-83) a revolution takes place which ends with the British being defeated and the independent American nation being born. Dobb gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are conscripted by the Continental Army  swept away by events they can barely understand, the Dobbs finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another. Tom also falls in love with Daisy McConnahay (Natassja Kinski), a beautiful and fiery woman of British aristocratic ancestry. Their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to start with the film&#39;s flaws? Most key actors are miscast  Pacino has been criticised enough already, but Kinski fares little better as the renegade aristocrat while Donald Sutherland is hopelessly lost as a ruthless English soldier with a wobbly Yorkshire accent. Robert Dillon&#39;s script is muddled in its attempts to bring massive historical events down to a personal level. At no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the American Revolution as a backdrop, or an epic war film with a handful of sharply drawn characters used to carry the story along. As a result, the narrative falls into no man&#39;s land, flitting from &#34;grand spectacle&#34; to &#34;small story&#34; indiscriminately and meaninglessly. John Corigliano&#39;s score is quite ghastly, and is poured over the proceedings with neither thought nor subtlety. Hugh Hudson&#39;s direction is clumsy throughout, both in his mismanagement of Pacino and the other key actors, and in the decision to use irritatingly shaky camera work during the action sequences. The idea of the hand-held camera is to create immediacy  that feeling of &#34;being there&#34; in the confusion of battle and musket fire. Like so many other things in the film, it doesn&#39;t work. The one department where the film regains a modicum of respectability is the period detail, with costumes, sets and weaponry that look consistently accurate. But if it&#39;s period detail you&#39;re interested in a trip to the museum would be a better way to spend your time, because as a rousing cinematic experience Revolution doesn&#39;t even begin to make the grade. Nothing more than a £18,000,000 mega-bomb that the ailing British film industry could ill afford in the mid-1980s.

The Regard of Flight and the Clown Bagatelles as performed by Bill Irwin are some of the funniest (both in terms of physical comedy and verbal and visual gags) performances I&#39;ve ever seen. My father taped this special when it first aired in the 80s and my family has loved it ever since. We quote it back and forth fairly constantly. It&#39;s a crying shame that copies are not readily available for purchase. I have a bad VHS copy that I acquired from a specialty distributer a few years ago, but Mr. Irwin&#39;s performance deserves a proper DVD treatment with a restored version of the original performance and interviews with the performers/producers as well as more examples of modern clowning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Irwin&#39;s talent deserves more exposure to mainstream audiences than it has enjoyed in his limited wide release appearances. I share &#34;The Regard of Flight&#34; with friends quite often and though I am always greeted with a small amount of skepticism when I mention that it is a mixture of clowning and vaudeville I have yet to have anyone come away from seeing it without loving it. In case the powers that be ever happen upon this IMDb listing, please consider releasing this and other Bill Irwin work.

I missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on ABC website during the summer of 2007. I am absolutely crazy about the show. I think the entire cast is excellent. It&#39;s one of my favorite show ever. I just checked the ABC program lineup for this Fall and did not see it on the schedule. That is really sad. I hope they will bring it back ... maybe they are waiting until Bridget Moynahan has her baby? Or is it only my wishful thinking? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks, similar to mine. I certainly hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up.

I am only 11 years old but I discovered Full House when I was about five and watched it constantly until I was seven. Then I grew older and figured Full House could wait and that I had &#34;more important&#34; things to do. Plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too &#34;girly.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and I once again became addicted to it. Full House has made me laugh and cry. It&#39;s made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the world of Full House plus a mom. I have heard people say Full House is cheesy and unbelievable. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. The three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times. What&#39;s any more real than that? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything the show has lifted me up when I&#39;m down and brought me up even higher when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness. I have howled like a hyena at the show and gained a massive obsessiveness over Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course Hilary Duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the cutest babies I have ever seen. They are great actresses and seem to be very nice people.)

-only few can understand Leland&#39;s character, and to do that u most likely are inborn to see both sides of life,and to face this reality is very hard and can lead some few to bad acts(like Leland&#39;s character does)but for such sad and real reasons that his intentions were good,in the sense that the intention to save another from physical or mental(in this case)pain over long time. and it is really sad how mostly everyone in this movie makes mistakes in it, but the one character to make one through good intentions is killed by it. the lesson of this movie is for the unique person to see,realize,face and make right of the real life situation u see and to make right,or inspire one who can make right of a wrong situation. but before that...u have to see both sides of something and rationalize it for the sake of long peace,and tranquility of all human life.aka-Don&#39;t BE IGNORANT

witty. funny. intelligent. awesome. i was flipping channels late one night years ago. came across this and a wildfire started. i was staying up late every night and taping it for everyone i know. a few. like 3 people out of the almost 100 people i made watch this didn&#39;t think it was as awesome as i did. the others were laughing out loud so hard they were crying and thanking me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. run don&#39;t walk. watch this and enjoy. intelligence and humor. it&#39;s a win-win situation. i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need more of....sanechaos.

Its not sophisticated, and nobody in the credits had a great career, but taken as a whole, because there are no famous personalities; the film seems more realistic than some high budget, well cast films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A film made for a few bucks, that is worthy of watching should give hope to all those would be film makers and wantabee actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this film is it was made in the worst possible time. TV was taking over the revenues of the film industry, and this film could have easily been shown on TV. In 1950, all the fare on TV would qualify for a &#34;G&#34; rating. The film industry began to make more &#34;adult&#34; films that could not be shown on TV during the days when TV wouldn&#39;t dare show the sex and skin of today&#39;s commercials.

I just saw this at SIFF, and I absolutely loved it. There were parts where I laughed so hard I couldn&#39;t catch my breath. The script and direction by Glenn McQuaid are fantastic. I can&#39;t wait to see more from this talented young man. The performances make the movie. Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are just delightful as the graverobber Willy and his apprentice Arthur. Ron Perlman turns in a fantastic performance (as usual) as a less-than-sympathetic jailhouse priest. Bonus: Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! As always, he balances menace and humor perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a style of horror comedy that really hasn&#39;t been seen since Vincent Price did &#34;Comedy of Terrors,&#34; &#34;The Raven,&#34; and &#34;Theater of Blood.&#34; The movie is genuinely scary in places, then it&#39;ll suddenly flip back into hilarious mode, keeping you totally off balance. Some parts are scary and funny at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only afford to see three movies at SIFF this year, but even if the other two are awful, &#34;I Sell The Dead&#34; was worth the price of all three. I&#39;m going to be looking for more movies from Larry Fessenden&#39;s Glass Eye Pix. He&#39;s giving the horror genre a much-needed kick in the butt.

Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy stars in this, one of his weakest werewolf films... but bear with me for a moment. Most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title, THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN, and there have been many home video versions of it over the years. If you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot though, the most workable edition I&#39;ve seen of it goes by the title THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS, and it&#39;s an unedited and complete European version which restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from FURY&#39;s print. It is also letterboxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet only to find out that he&#39;s contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife has been having an affair. He takes care of her and her lover while in animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman doctor and her female assistant. Apparently, the doc attempts to &#34;tame&#34; the werewolf, and there is a very strange sado-masochistic love scene between her and the hairy and fanged Daninsky who is under her trance, at least in the original version. Ultimately we get two werewolves for the price of one as Daninsky battles a she-wolf! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem with the movie is that the director (according to Naschy&#39;s claims) was often drunk, and the results are indeed rather incoherent. When watching THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS copy, it&#39;s not quite as difficult to make out what&#39;s going on, though the editing remains atrocious in spots. Worst of all is occasional non-matching footage of Naschy&#39;s ravenous werewolf swiped straight from another previous film (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka &#34;FRANKENSTEIN&#39;S BLOODY TERROR&#34;) and mixed into this one without any sensible reason! The wolf&#39;s clothing changes from black shirt to white and back again, as does his demeanor; one moment the wolf is walking around lethargically in a hypnotic trance from FURY, next he is growling and running around savagely from BLOODY TERROR. Really bizarre.

Rented the video with a lot of expectations, but it was a disappointment. The story didn&#39;t make sense, the plot was very weak and the special effects.. well, I think even I can do better with my home computer. Sorry. Missed a change here.

&#34;Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels&#34;... &#39;nuff said. Just don&#39;t be expecting anything along the lines of &#34;Devil Went Down To Georgia&#34;, ol&#39; Charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that&#39;s it for lyrics. Hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY film) and who doesn&#39;t love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen? The box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that &#34;you can lose your life-- or your mind!&#34;, but mostly it&#39;s two couples trekking through the sticks and &#34;acting&#34; natural. Love that hermit.

This first installment of Crispin Glover&#39;s personal magnum opus asks you to think a little, and so can&#39;t be recommended for any viewer who doesn&#39;t want to sit and puzzle over Glover&#39;s imagery or follow the surprisingly simplebut weirdly obfuscatedthread of his narrative. To the more casual viewer, yes, it&#39;s probably going to come off as a confusing mish-mash of odd, startling, and disturbing imagery for imagery&#39;s sake. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get the sense that Glover doesn&#39;t mind that this is the case, and he&#39;ll almost as gladly listen to why someone hated the film as to why they enjoyed it. Glover&#39;s innate eagerness for and about his work and how audiences interpret it is strongly communicated not only through the film itself, but also through the unusual question and answer sessions that he frequently conducts following showings; he clearly hopes that people will continue to think about what he has presented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The easiest way to interpret and dismiss the film is to label it as Dada or nihilist, a juvenile attack on the modern movie industry from an actor who&#39;s worked both without and within. But there&#39;s a reason why Glover performs his slideshow before showing his movie, and it&#39;s not only to sell books; his books juxtapose and create a narrative from images and text that Glover pieced together, and What Is It? does similarly with imagery drawn from Western culture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Is It? is an endearing and compelling film in ways one hardly expects while viewing. Much has already been made about Glover&#39;s use of actors with Down&#39;s syndrome, and indeed that is one of the most initially striking aspects of the film. So jarring, in fact, that many seem to interpret it as some sort of far-reaching crusade to see a more realistic and/or dignified portrayal of the disabled in movies and televisionor, on the absolute other end of the spectrum, as a kind of direct exploitation of the disabled. But it&#39;s not either, and maybe that&#39;s part of what makes this film so uncomfortable for many: the underlying agenda is not a political one or one of hatred, but one of looking beyond the mainstream culture into a kind of outsider ugliness. It&#39;s not a film about Down&#39;s syndrome, but it is a film that is owned by the actors with Down&#39;s syndrome who appear in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m the sort of person who is entirely gung-ho when it comes to ugliness and strangeness being portrayed so starkly that it is beautiful; happily for me, this is pretty much exactly how What Is It? presents itself to viewers. Glover uses the strange images of snails, death, and the disabled in part because he wants his audience to feel discomfort at either the sheer oddness of the imagery or the visceral reaction one has to the dying screams of an anthropomorphized snail. In some ways, the weirdly compelling (and occasionally downright grotesque) elements of What Is It? remind me of the work of the painter Francis Bacon he of the infamous popes, yes, and the odd distortions of the human figure that inevitably make viewers cringe and want to look away. Like Bacon&#39;s paintings, Glover&#39;s film manages to be opulent and humble, grainy and polished, chaotic and well-realized and the contradictions help to make it all the more disconcerting. But still this is not an entirely serious film, and it largely manages to sidestep the greatest pitfalls of pretension through the use of humor that, for the most part, derives from the use (and juxtaposition) of familiar items, images, and names of popular culture. And when What Is It? is funny, it is very funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, What Is It? is an impressive first film from Glover as a director and writer, and his presence as an actor in the film proves not to be nearly the distraction one might expect it to be. Watching it is like being an observer in the kind of dream that isn&#39;t exactly good or bad, but just strange and that leaves you feeling slightly grimy when you wake up. If that&#39;s the kind of art you enjoy, What Is It? is likely to exceed your expectations and be well-worth the effort of catching it in the theatre, along with The Big Slide Show and Glover himself. All in all, it&#39;s an experience you&#39;re unlikely to forget any time soon.

This could be difficult to for some people to get into, being used to Hollywood production styles. The directing is uninspired, apparently simply a filming of the stage set-up, and the audio quality is bad here and there (the rustling of people&#39;s clothes occasionally competes with their voices, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends and I started watching without knowing what to expect, and the first scene almost put us off. It seemed very stagy and cheesy. Then we picked up on the tone of the content, and really started to enjoy ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very funny, despite some corniness. Definitely give it a chance if you appreciate great dialog. Also, Helena Bonham Carter is adorable, of course.

This movie stinks! You will want back the two-plus hours it takes to get through it. Sliding Doors, w/ Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda &amp; Melinda tries to do much much MUCH better. That movie was clever, witty, and well-acted. I cared about what happened to both Gwyenths -- or rather the characters she played -- and the performances by supporting cast were fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where as Melinda &amp; Melinda is tiresome, the dialogue is contrived and I could have cared less about any of these people -- least of all Melinda. One Melinda is so dysfunctional -- her first glass of wine is at 10 a.m. -- and so melodramatic she is laughable, and not in the comedic sense. The 2nd Melinda is fine, but forgettable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woody Allen&#39;s previous ensemble movies worked because, I&#39;m guessing, he spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented. One piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this screenplay in two months: you can tell. And while Chloe Sevigny is talented -- those around her are not, not enough to be a whole presence. The movie ends up being Chloe Sevigny and a bunch of other people you know you&#39;ve seen in other movies but can&#39;t quite remember which ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad, very sad.

Now any Blaxploiation fan will recognise the ingredients: big Afros, topless babes, surreally bad fashions and some &#39;jive&#39; talk. In this case add in a lead who can&#39;t act, a plot that makes little sense, editing by someone with no hands who has been blindfolded and the most god-awful fight scenes and you have &#39;TNT Jackson&#39;. Not quite bad enough to be good, but not good enough to be bad, this is a wonderful mess from start to finish. I especially loved the endless continuity errors and the lead&#39;s white stunt double.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so &#39;70s bad Far Eastern martial arts meets black power that it hurts, but boy it hurts so good! I am ashamed to admit that I almost enjoyed it.

Brit director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America, and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed; but this small film was where he started. And it certainly showcased his talent, with its striking black-and-white cinematography and achronological storytelling that prefigures his later &#39;Momento&#39;, albeit in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanistically, the plot reminded me of David Mamet&#39;s &#39;House of Games&#39;, but the film still feels fresh and sharp, right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected, but whose pointedness is unexpectedly delicious. The acting, on the other hand, is not quite in the same class - the film has a stylised quality, and possibly to a greater extent than the director intended. But it&#39;s still a fine debut, simultaneously claustrophobic and beguiling.

This movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate. My nieces have watched it non-stop since they&#39;ve gotten it, and as a result I&#39;ve seen it nearly 4 times all the way through. I can&#39;t get enough of it. The CGI images are great to watch, the humor is good, and the ballet portrayals are excellent. Although the story line has a few holes, no little girl will pick up on them, and as an adult, the movie is so charming that one hardly even notices. Just keep in mind that it is a Barbie movie, and, though cheesy at times, in my experience, this one lives up to the high standard which the other Barbie princess movies have set for it. I would recommend this to anyone who has a little girl who has always wanted to be a princess. It teaches a good lesson as well. Everyone is special and different in their own way, and everyone can make a difference.

A simple and effective film about what life is all about, responding to challenges. It took a lot of gall for Homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son, to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate. It took also three different challenges for Homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future. The challenge of the first ever man-made artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, a Soviet satellite, a milestone in human history, a turning point that Homer and his friends could not miss, did not want to miss. Then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds. Finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack, even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity, and even then Homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams. But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough. Homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need. If he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship, because his friends gave him precedence, his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate, thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes. It is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road. But the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man, like mining or football. The working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father. If the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day, the working class fate I am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap. Here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think. This might have been the fourth challenge Homer had to face: the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine &amp; University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne

The action scenes was quite good. But the plot of the movie, I would have to give it a score of 1 out of 10. It seems that the producers and director of this movie didn&#39;t thought about it carefully?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#39;t give much value and values to it&#39;s viewers except for it&#39;s violence. The entire story was about revenge. A boy witnessing a rape and murder. I would even recommend it to be banned. Those who watched it, you&#39;ve just lose some money. If you&#39;re thinking of watching it, watch something else. I would ask for a refund if I was on a movie theater. So for you guys and girls out there reading this article. Please don&#39;t waste time.

I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unkind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to it (to say the least)... but it was terrible. Really terrible. Badly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;acted, a witless script, cack handed direction... Watching this film was&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like watching a car crash- you want to look away but you keep staring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;because you want to see how messy it&#39;s going to get. Well, the car is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wrecked and there are no survivors. On the plus side, the cinematography&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was nice, made me want to go on holiday, if only to cleanse myself from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this unholy

The Greek locale for parts of the movie were very beautiful and the photography get all my votes and that&#39;s about the extent of my raves for this movie. I found that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes found so often in the American culture and were shallow and uninteresting. Susan Sarandon and Gena Rowlands are easy to look at but I found their characters very narcissistic and unlikeable for many other reasons. When Gena Rowlands sings at a party it made me wonder how this woman could think of herself as a competent star of the stage. I was tempted to hit the MUTE button until she finished singing. Molly Ringwald was herself and Raul Julia&#39;s character was so lecherous he was downright creepy. The movie was much too long for my liking and I could not sit through it again even at the point of a gun.

Opening scene &#39;explains&#39; why Hurt is later &#39;immune&#39; to the &#39;Contaminated Man&#39;. Too bad it doesn&#39;t explain anything else: How did he get whatever he &#39;caught&#39;/what was it/why does it work so fast. Then we go to &#34;Present Day Budapest&#34;. OK, was the opener in the past or the future? It turns out to be the past, of course, but for a minute it looks just as likely to be the nd of the movie moved to the beginning. Sorry, I should have paid closer attention, huh? Or maybe it&#39;s just badly done. Then a lot of confusion about the different jobs he&#39;s had in related fields, and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him. Aha! So the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects? He must have been one of the top guys, he&#39;s friends with the c e o of the Chemical company, for God sakes. Then there&#39;s the substance itself: Technically a poison, but it mutates in immune &#39;carriers&#39;, so we can have whatever we want; a poison, a disease, an allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. Magically, it&#39;s not contagious from one dying victim to another, only from the carrier. How convenient. Then there&#39;s the h a z m a t protocol: They jump into a situation without having any idea what&#39;s in store, or how prepare for it. Did the producers not have enough money to show a proper wash-down after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance? I kept thinking Hurt was going to die from bad cleanup technique, and the open scene would turn out to be the closer after all.

Has anyone ever read or heard comments by Scorsese or David Chase ( Soprano&#39;s Exec. Producer) about &#34;Death Collector/Family Enforcer&#34;? I bought the DVD after not having seen it for a while on cable (like 20 years), but having seen &#34;Goodfellas&#34; and the entire &#34;Sopranos&#34; run to date. In retrospect, both guys must have seen Death Collector/Family Enforcer and absorbed the flavor ,perhaps inspiring the tone for their masterworks, both of which the polar opposite of the romanticized Godfather trilogy. Being a Jersey guy, it is interesting to see how the Jersey meadowlands have evolved since the mid-70&#39;s. It is not the swampy dumping ground it used to be although once in a while a body will turn up in a local waterway. Also, it&#39;s a little bittersweet to seen a newly constructed World Trade Center in the across the river in the opening and closing scene. Who could have imagined?

The idea is nice. Bringing so many stars in one movie is great. But.... too many stories, too short and lacking really any sense. No connection between the scenes. There were some 3-4 brilliant stories... but these were out of 18. The frame reminded me of &#34;All the invisible children&#34; - a movie which I liked a lot. Compared to it, however, &#34;Paris Je T&#39;Aime&#34; lacks the intriguing short story, which develops - starts and has its end. And it lacks the topic connecting all those - children. I do not find Paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches together.Perhaps for people who know Paris it is interesting. Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it...

So this guy named George is sitting home alone on his birthday when two women show up. George&#39;s wife is at a hospital taking care of their son so when the wife is away George gets in the bubble bath and makes love to both of the girls. It isn&#39;t that great of a scene because it really doesn&#39;t show anything. After that the birthday boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still at his house. They make him a nice breakfast but George isn&#39;t hungry. George isn&#39;t very happy and he tries to ditch them but when he gets home the girls are still at his house. The girls have had enough with old George and no longer want to cook for them. They both turn out to be major psychopaths and use George in their little crazy game. I liked that the girls just did what they wanted and messed up George&#39;s house. George wasn&#39;t really that great to his two guests. When George said he was a married man, he really didn&#39;t seem to mean it. George looked like Tom Tucker on Family Guy. I was for the two girls the whole time.

Boogie Nights is one of the best films to come out of the 90&#39;s and I&#39;d go so far as to say it should be in the IMDb top 250. I can actually understand why many would dislike it, due to the subject matter. I personally feel however as many do, judging from the aclaim this film&#39;s received by viewers and critics that it&#39;s topnotch film making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The direction and acting in this film surpass good and reach the level of brilliance.There is not one scene in this movie that isn&#39;t amazing. The individual characters reach out and touch you. Given that this is a movie about the porn industry, one wouldn&#39;t imagine the sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity but they are. The direction is among the best I&#39;ve ever seen-and I&#39;ve seen a lot of films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film isn&#39;t about one particular personal individual&#39;s story, it&#39;s about many.It&#39;s a character study about people who have many layers to them and who maybe in an industry most would find alien but who still dream the same dreams and have both bad and good to them. Boogie Nights draws you into their story from the beginning, and though the film is long(I believe almost 3 hours) you honestly don&#39;t even notice. And when it ends you kind of don&#39;t want it to....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not easy to impress, meaning there aren&#39;t many movies I&#39;d give a 10 of 10 rating to but this is one. Beyond the multiple character study, is the use of music in the film. I have never, in all my years of seeing movies seen music tell a story as well as in this movie.There was such flawlessness to it, you know it&#39;s not something your gonna see everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt reynold&#39;s performance was perhaps the best I&#39;ve ever seen him do, and Mark Wahlberg is incredible(I&#39;m astounded there are still people saying he doesn&#39;t act well. I don&#39;t know how anyone viewing this could possibly think that)but the person who really surprised me was Heather Grahem(Rollergirl) who is absolutely fantastic in her role, in particular the one memorable scene with Burt Reynolds in the Limo, towards the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I&#39;ll echo other IMDb reviewers in saying this movie is not for everybody. But I still think this was topnotch.10 of 10.

Discovery Channel/Animal Planet must be ashamed of themselves. This Fantasy is modeled after the &#34;Walking with Dinosuars&#34; series. Even though this is 100% fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. Even mixing the fantasy dragons with T-rexs and the extinction of the dinos. Added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say Sci-Fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On its own the show is about an 7.5/10 far as entertainment goes. But the way in which it is presented I have to give it a 1/10. Don&#39;t get me wrong I have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong. I can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think this weakens the great &#34;Walking with Dinosuars&#34; series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini-series.

I loved &#34;Flash Gordon&#34; as a child and watching the series again on DVD brings back such fond memories. Each 15-minute episode features the adventures of our hero Flash, the lovely Dale Arden, and intrepid Dr. Zarkov on the planet Mongo, with Flash escaping death at every turn: The Shark Men nearly drown him, he faces the Fire Monster in the Tunnel of Terror, and he&#39;s in mortal peril in the Static Room! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are still fun: Buster Crabbe is every bit the blonde dreamboat hero and Jean Rogers is a delicate and beautiful Dale Arden. Princess Aura still plots to steal Flash for herself, King Vultan of the Hawk Men still has his booming laugh and angel wings, and Ming the Merciless, Emperor of the Universe, is still giving everyone the evil eye and the creeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serial probably wouldn&#39;t interest children today with its hokey effects - oh, that spaceship! - but it&#39;s a fun bit of nostalgia for those who liked it the first time around. The actors play it straight and don&#39;t play down to kids. I appreciate that young viewers were expected to read the chapter synopses which had pretty big words in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m glad this came out on DVD. It&#39;s a lot of fun to revisit this classic sci-fi serial.

First of all - I&#39;m not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70&#39;s when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home. At the time it was pretty risky to have a movie about a couple of young runaways who successfully setup house and have a baby on their own. I&#39;m not surprised the movie and Elton John&#39;s soundtrack are almost unknown today. The music is beautiful. It was unforgettable.

On Humphrey Bogart&#39;s first trip to Hollywood, he got his first leading man role in this B picture Love Affair. The first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or the two remakes that followed. It&#39;s not half as good any of those films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact Bogey is second billed to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she&#39;s been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father&#39;s best friend and financial adviser Hale Hamilton. It comes as quite a shock to Mackaill. She considers a show business career as a way for an income.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and he&#39;s designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors. Mackaill is willing to do it, besides she likes what she sees in Bogey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the cynical roles that Bogart later made a specialty, it&#39;s a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in Love Affair. The part doesn&#39;t wear well on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Affair is your average B program second feature, nothing terribly special about it.

&#34;The Long Kiss Goodnight&#34; is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller, and a career breakthrough for Geena Davis. The plot is very familiar to that of The Bourne Identity but so what. The fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plotline is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s directed with a slick sense of style and avoids most action cliches. Geena Davis is great as an action chick and gets past her usual &#34;good wife&#34; role. Samuel L. Jackson is good as usual as the supporting player. The film&#39;s baddie is overly cheesy though and you can tell what&#39;s going to happen to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It breaks away from the usual run-of-the-mill actioners such as Commando and On Deadly Ground and is definetly one of the best actioners in years. Good fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.4/10.

Wrestlemania 2 is the only Wrestlemania|thank god| to be held at three different locations, and While it was an interesting idea, it didn&#39;t really work. There are only really two matches that really struck out, with the rest being decent, or most of them, pretty terrible. There are some entertaining celebrity&#39;s on hand, like Susan Saint James, Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby, but the experience was a waste of time for the most part. The British Bulldgos Vs The Dream Team match, is worth the price of admission itself, but you can honestly see that anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nassau Coliseum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Orndorff Vs The Magnificent Muraco/W Mr.Fuji. For the time it had, and despite the crappy finish, this was surprisingly bearable stuff, with the crowd being really into it. Crowd chants &#34;Bullsh*t&#34; at the end. That being said it did nothing for either&#39;s career. Match ends in a double count out with them fighting outside the ring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intercontinental Championship Match. Randy Savage|C| Vs George &#34;The Animal&#34; Steele. Not that great wrestling wise, but heavily entertaining due to the antics involved, and some great comedy from Steele, besides savage can wrestle a potato and make it look interesting. Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes, for leverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 1/2 /5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake &#34;The Snake&#34; Roberts Vs George Wells. For a throwaway match, this was better than it should have been, but it&#39;s too short to make any impact what so ever. Roberts wins with the DDT, pulling out the snake afterwords, which disgusts Saint James.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 1/2 /5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boxing Match. Mr.T/W The Hati Kid&amp;Joe Frazier Vs Roddy Piper/W Lou Duva&amp;Bob Orton. A huge failure in my opinion. I was bored senseless throughout this, and while it may have been a marketing success, it certainly didn&#39;t succeed at entertaining me. Lot of Rowdy chants are noticeable as well. T wins by DQ, when Piper slams T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosemont Horizon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women&#39;s Title match. Fabulous Moolah|C| Vs Velvet Mcintyre. Ends too quickly, before it even gets a chance to start, making a record for quick pin fall, as far as Woman&#39;s matches are concerned. Moolah wins when she takes advantage of Velvet&#39;s missed splash from the top rope&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corporal Kirchner Vs Nikolai Volkoff/W Classy Freddie Blassie. Big pop for the Corporal. Stupid match up, with boring offense from both involved, while being much too short to matter. Corporal wins when he whacks Volkoff with Blassie&#39;s cane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battle Royal. William Perry and Andre get the biggest pops. This is pretty entertaining stuff, despite all the NFL talent involved. It&#39;s also noteworthy for Bret Hart&#39;s 1st ever Wrestlemania appearance. Andre wins when he chucks The Hart Foundation out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 1/2 /5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tag Team Titles. British Bulldogs/W Lou Albano&amp;Ozzy Osbourne Vs The Dream Team/W Johnny Valiant|C|. Absolutely tremendous match, that is one of the best wrestlemania matches of all time. You won&#39;t have time to catch your breath, with all the maneuvers on hand, and the excellent in ring psychology. This is pure wrestling at it&#39;s finest, you cannot call yourself a Wrestling fan, if you dislike this match. Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid collide&#39;s heads with Valentine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ricky Steamboat Vs Hercules Hernandez. Pretty decent match up here, with both men putting on solid performances. Hercules is a nasty brute, with above average skills, and it contrasted well with Steamboat&#39;s high-flying style. Steamboat wins with a high-flying cross body off the top rope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 1/2 /5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adrian Adonis Vs Uncle Elmer. Terrible match, with annoying comedy involved. The fans love Uncle Elmer, but I do not. Adonis wins with a top rope maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Funk Brothers Vs Tito Santana&amp;JYD. Pretty solid match here, with a lot of memorable bumps taken from Terry Funk|the one through the table was something else for that time|. I would have to rate this as my 2nd favorite. Funks win with help from Jimmy Hart&#39;s megaphone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan|C| Vs King Kong Bundy. Decent pop for Hogan. One of the most over-hyped matches in Wrestlemania history. Hogan can&#39;t wrestle worth a lick, and Bundy is not that great himself. The violence was brutal for the time, but Hogan&#39;s superhero act is kind of annoying, and there are too many boring moments. Hogan wins when he escapes before Bundy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line. Wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects. Die hard wrestling fans should see this once, but you really don&#39;t have too. There isn&#39;t enough here, to satisfy a true wrestling fan. Vince blew it on this one. Don&#39;t be fooled by the hype of the main event, it really is a boring affair, like most of the card. Not recommended, and ranks as one of the worst Wrestlemania&#39;s, outside of the brilliant tag title match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10

My mother and I rented this gem a few years ago while she was here visiting for Thanksgiving. I have rarely laughed so hard. This is a typical low-budget horror movie with dumb special effects, a worse plot, and even worse acting. But are you really expecting a classic when Linnea Quigley receives top billing? I thought not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this movie does have some entertainment value, I give it a 3 out of 10.

Edge Vs. Michaels-Boring in general (loved the sweet chin music into the chair) 4/10 Taker Vs. Heidenreich-One of the worst matches I&#39;ve seen, predictable as hell 1/10 Tripe Threat WWE match-Why do I watch them, nobody ever wins a championship at the rumble, its not the main event. Liked it when Show drove JBL through the wall. 3/10 World Heavyweight Championship-Pretty OK match, kind of more a beat-down by Tripe H than a match, but I was happy to see it after watching crap. 5/10 Royal Rumble-Good Rumble,Liked the brand showdown,the Hassan thing, and the end. 7/10 Overall still crap. Why does anyone watch the rumble???

&#34;May contain spoilers&#34; Sadly Lou Costellos&#39; last film has the distinction of being slightly better than Abbott &amp; Costello&#39;s last movie together &#34;Dance With Me Henry&#34;. This movie isn&#39;t all in all outright terrible it is an amusing career misfire. Dorothy Provine is nice to look at and makes the movie somewhat bearable. You can&#39;t blame Lou Costello for this because a major studio released it which meant somebody had to give it the &#34;green&#34; light. In my opinion Lou Costello was getting over problems of his own losing his son a few years earlier and the unwarranted attacks from the IRS. If you look at the last 3-4 Abbott &amp; Costello movies you can notice the magic was gone. Check out &#34;Dance With Me Henry&#34; now that&#39;s a painful movie to watch.

His John Dark-Kevin Connor fantasy adventures were a mainstay of Summer holiday movies in the days before Star Wars: they weren&#39;t masterpieces, they didn&#39;t boast state-of-the-art special effects, but they were exactly what an audience of kids wanted from a film back in the mid 70s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Earth&#39;s Core catches just the right tone for the appropriately named Burroughs&#39; pulp adventure about Victorian inventor Peter Cushing and the inevitable Doug McClure ending up in the underground world of Pelucidar and battling its evil telepathic fighting dinosaurs. This time the puppets are gone in favour of men in monster suits, which is a lot more fun if you&#39;re willing to suspend your disbelief, and if you&#39;re not there&#39;s always Caroline Munro&#39;s cleavage to look at. Aside from what may well be Peter Cushing&#39;s worst performance, an irritating but dottier rehash of his movie Dr Who (&#34;You can&#39;t mesmerise me, I&#39;m British!&#34;), it&#39;s easily the best of the John Dark-Kevin Connor-Doug McClure fantasy adventures, surprisingly well directed and boasting an atmospheric use of colour. Never especially good at exterior scenes, Alan Hume&#39;s photography gains immensely from the control a studio set gives him (the film was shot entirely on soundstages) to paint a luridly vivid world worthy of a pulp novel cover. Not high art but definitely great Saturday matinée fun.

Many consider BEAST STABLE to be the last of the &#34;true&#34; FEMALE PRISONER films, as it is the last of the series directed by Shunya Ito, and is followed by one other film (GRUDGE SONG) by a different director. I have not seen GRUDGE SONG yet (but soon will...) so I don&#39;t know how it stacks up to the previous FP films - but it will be interesting to see. The way BEAST STABLE ended didn&#39;t really leave a lot of room for another predecessor - but I guess I&#39;ll find out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This entry has Scorpion on the run from the cops, where she hooks up with a street-hooker who ends up pregnant with her retarded brothers child (oh yeah - that&#39;s no lie...gotta love these sleazy story lines). Scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old rival, but (as she is so good at...) ends up escaping and taking revenge on some people that wronged a few of her hooker friends...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with some other reviewers, that this one is a little slower at points and more &#34;serious&#34; then the previous two entries. The story is somewhat confusing and convoluted at times, but a lot of these 70&#39;s era pinky films are - and I still love them. BEAST STABLE is lacking pretty badly in the nudity area which was pretty disappointing - but I thought it strong in other areas - storyline, cinematography, some good sleaze,etc...Definitely worthwhile to fans of this sort of thing, or who have enjoyed the other FEMALE PRISONER films...8/10

Avida is a game of words mingling life and eagerness, but I personally think this movie was overblown by its ambition and does not make justice to its title. It gathers a set of awkward characters united by unbelievable links. Furthermore, the way everything is connected at the end is, in my opinion, a bit pathetic. What remains of it was a set of images... an interesting one, but not enough to make this a good movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this film is supposed to be a comedy, but I surely didn&#39;t noticed! The nonsense and caricatural nature of the movie is actually the only good thing about it, but when it drags on an on and on it becomes no longer bearable. I have to say I fought hard to continue seeing it until the end, and I am still not sure it was worth it...

Some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork - to be able to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with antagonizing pain and death.. I personally think that this movie is a disgust, which should have never been released. This movie is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come. The appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp for air but they set in your mind and it takes days to forget them. Such a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering.. &#34;Kill Bill&#34; would be another example but at least &#34;Kill Bill&#34; has its purpose, meaning, climax and resolution..

Everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. And were is all the blood and gore that was in &#34;Demons&#34; which is a good movie and it was not scary at all. My Brother said that this movie was bad but I had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good. When the movie was over I understand why my brother thought this movie was bad. The only plus in this movie was the music by &#34;The Smiths&#34; and &#34;The Cult&#34;, but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing. And I saw that it has been released four sequels after this film, I haven&#39;t seen none of them but can they be as awful as this one, I have no plans to see them but maybe I will see them some time.

This sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb. Nazis, occult , government conspiracies. I was expecting a low budget Nazi version of the DaVinci code or the Boys from Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead you get something quite different, more psychological, more something like from David Lynch. That was actually a plus. But the way the story is told is just awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the trouble is the casting. Andrienne Barbeau&#39;s character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid. She just doesn&#39;t do that well, even at her age, though she certainly tried. The actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy. Most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie, or at least acted like it, rather than simply being quirky. The only one that I thought did really well was the daughter, Siri Baruc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big part is the pacing. It starts off very slowly. So slowly you might be tempted to turn it off. But then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughter&#39;s suicide and the aftermath. But shortly afterward, it all becomes a jumbled mess. Some of this was on purpose, but much of it was just needlessly confusing, monotonous, and poorly focused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real problem, is it&#39;s simply not a pleasant movie to watch. It&#39;s slow, dull, none of the characters are likable. Overuse of imagery and sets. Some movies you see characters get tortured. In this, it&#39;s the viewer that does. It does have a few creepy moments, most notably the creepy Nazi paintings and the credits, but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome.

Except for the appearance of talented Austin Powers impersonator Richard Halpern, this pic was your run of the mill movie spoof. Dated movie references will not help audiences that may come across this endeavor in future. Watch for &#34;Groovy&#34; Austin Powers in the hot tub. It&#39;s a hoot and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor special effects are overcome by the appearance of numerous starlets in skimpy outfits, so at least that should keep one entertained (if that&#39;s what thrills you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my money, I would rent the DVD of classic spoofs such as &#34;Airplane&#34; or &#34;Lobster Man from Mars&#34;.

Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and the late Vic Morrow are the human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers about his brother&#39;s death. Mr. Sheen, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Morrow all turn in first rate performances in their respective roles; Ms. Phillips has the slightly less than enviable task of trying to spice up a made-for-TV movie (twenty-five years ago), by supplying the &#34;sex interest&#34; in an otherwise sexless film. The real star, however, is the &#34;California Kid&#34;; a 1934 Ford coupe, borrowed from &#34;Jake&#34; Jacobs, put before a camera and given a workout that&#39;ll leave the viewer panting, gasping and holding the edge of the seat with breathless anticipation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action scenes are spectacular, (although some of the dialog is a bit lame) making for a fine evening&#39;s diversion. This is how all &#34;car movies&#34; should be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to catch this one on the late movie channel; it&#39;s well worth the missed sleep.

WARNING **SPOILERS**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lord knows I have seen some bad movies in my time and this one makes me just as angry. This is an insult to people who ARE LOOKING for a bad movie. The &#34;story&#34; involves a stewardess who discovers her boyfriend (badly acted by otherwise great Robert Wagner) is a murder, thief, and just an overall puke face. After the Concorde takes off, he sends guided missiles to destroy the Concorde. So while the Concorde is traveling at the speed of light, our &#34;hero&#34; (played with utter stupidity, George Kennedy) opens the window in the cockpit then, sticks his hand OUT THE WINDOW to fire at the missile! I&#39;m no rocket scientist, but it seems his hand would at least get a wind burn. Then towards the final &#34;climax&#34; when the Concorde is headed for certain disaster and everyone will die, a passenger turns to his fiance and proposes marriage. A Priest just happens to be sitting in the next row and proceeds to marry them as the planes is crashing! (I&#39;m not making this up) Wow, the guy who wrote the script must have been sniffing glue for a week.

A young Korean artist lives in Amsterdam. She is a bit of a loner and has never had a serious relationship, insisting that she is &#34;waiting&#34; for the right person. She works in the public square, drawing portraits for passersby but, for herself, she also indulges in painting her favorite flowers, daisies. But, all of a sudden, she has a secret admirer. Flowers are delivered to her residence every day at 4:15, usually daisies, yet she can not catch the sender in the act. This is because, unknown to her, her beau is a Korean hit-man, and he wishes to remain hidden, for now. One day in the square, however, another attractive Korean man sits for the artist and happens to be carrying a pot of daisies. She concludes that he is her shy hero and, also, the man she has been waiting to find. This second gentleman, too, has a secret; he is an Interpol agent. The assassin can see everything that transpires in the square, due to having an apartment close by. Naturally, he is disturbed that another man has entered the young girl&#39;s life. How will this shadowy love triangle play out? This is a beautiful picture to watch. The setting in Amsterdam and the surrounding countryside is very, very lovely. Add in three most attractive young Korean actors and, visually, any viewer has a stunning panorama in front of them. The story is quite nice, too, being a mixture of drama and action, with a dash of the unexpected. Costumes are very fetching and the production values, high. In short, anyone searching for a quality foreign film with a compelling story and great scenery would find this movie a wonderful choice for a diverting evening. Should you have someone&#39;s hand to hold during the view, so much the better.

This movie follows in the tracks of The Riddle for an all star British cast in a downright awful movie! Poor cgi effects, poor editing, poor direction, a cast that i hope were well paid as this will be a nail in many a careers coffin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nigel Planer should&#39;ve donned his Neil wig once more &amp; gone out with a laugh at least!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was like a particularly long &amp; drawn out episode of &#34;Torchwood&#34; but without the camp fake Canadian doctor fella...it had the same overly dramatic music though, perpetually repeated, in a vain attempt to drum up some tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh the humanity!

with this ABC family attempt of the hit blockbuster &#34;cheaper by the dozen&#34; comes an obnoxious amount of corny dialogue, shallow plot lines, and cheesy comebacks. With about two good actors among many wanna-be&#39;s, this movie was a major disappointment. Its a Hollywood-wannabe ditto of an already bad plot. Then, because they needed a lot of actors, that meant that they&#39;d probably be more lenient. So the acting wasn&#39;t five-star. The plot moved fairly fast, and the twists were bad and had horrible timing. The junction of characters and the &#34;end relationships&#34; were also too mushy and clichéd for me. Spare yourself and rent something better.

War drama that takes place in Louisiana in 1971. It follows a bunch of recruits through basic training and then Tigerland--an accurate portrayal of Vietnam on American soil, before they&#39;re shipped over. It focuses on two men--Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis)...how they meet, become friends and deal with a corwardly squadron leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and a borderline psycho (Shea Wingham).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A surprisingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. He uses a hand-held camera throughout most of the movie and uses digital video for the combat scenes. It works very well--the film looks gritty (as it should) and uncomfortably realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Farrell successfully covers up his Irish brogue and adopts a pretty convincing Southern accent. His performance is just superb--he&#39;s an extremely talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, is not that good. He&#39;s tall, muscular, very handsome--and very bland. The rest of the cast however is just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was thrown away by its studio. It had no stars in it, a familar story and was considered &#34;just another war film&#34;. It only played a week in Boston! It&#39;s well worth catching on video or DVD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Farrell and Davis have a lengthy nude scene.

I didn&#39;t know what to expect from the film. Well, now I know. This was a truly awful film. The screenplay, directing and acting were equally bad. The story was silly and stupid. The director could have made a smart and thought provoking film, but he didn&#39;t. I squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where was the focus to the film? Where was anything in this film? Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. It was shabbily done and a waste of my money. Do not see this film.

Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady...it&#39;s hard to be articulate about something this good. There isn&#39;t one character that you don&#39;t instantly love to watch- Myronex &#34;Putney, there&#39;s trouble in the black room!&#34; &#34;My name is Rufus.&#34; The lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. &#34;Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!&#34; &#34;My organization is pro-integration...&#34; &#34;Where&#39;s Lopez? &#39;He&#39;s in my head&#39;&#34; They don&#39;t sound brilliant until you hear them in the context of the scene. ...This movie will eat your brain, it&#39;s too good. I&#39;ve read reviews calling this film racist, which couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. Every scene is gold, from the Etherial Cereal commercial to the Brothers In the Black Room meeting to that haunting trumpet in the closing scene. One word - genius.

If you like bad movies (and you must to watch this one) here&#39;s a good one. Not quite as funny as the first, but much lower quality. A must-see for fans of Jack Frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing.

Any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake. Alex Baldwin trying to imitate the late Steve Mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn&#39;t work. While Baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish. McQueen had charisma, never try to compete with a star. As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw enough said. McQueen looked dangerous, menacing and believable as Doc, the film had excitement and suspense,Baldwin and company made this into a comedy,I laughed the one and only time I saw this miserable film. And that dreadful hairstyle for Michael Madsen who is one of today&#39;s more exciting and believable actors! Did the makeup people have it in for Michael, what were they thinking.If you wish to see movie-making the way it was under Sam Peckinpah&#39;s direction Get the original!

Hey, remember when Hal Hartley was brilliant? What a time that was. I&#39;d say the Book of Life was when things really started going downhill, but I will say that at least he went uphill from this one. A movie that looks like it was filmed on someone&#39;s cell phone wouldn&#39;t have to be a bad thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog, but alas, those are missing, along with Hartley&#39;s spare, quirky dialog. In their place is tedious exposition on themes of Christian end of times and a trite story of a modern Jesus in a quandary, packaged in a trying-to-be-hip modern world where everyone looks like someone out of a Hal Hartley movie. While it picks up a little in its second half, it&#39;s never enjoyable, or especially sensible. What the hell happened to you, Hartley?

The definition of a vampire is an inhumane corpse supposed to leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living. Bakjwi nearly nails this concept on the head minus the cliché of pointy fangs and neck biting. Being an R rated movie, I knew this was actually going to pertain to vampires actually being vampires. Which means that the characters in the movie are going to do what vampires actually do without restraint and rightfully lack any glamorous moments in comparison to Twilight. Having viewed Chan-wook Park&#39;s preceding Oldboy, I had very high expectations of Bakjwi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I anticipated some awkward plot sequences with our anti-hero, known as Priest Sang-hyeon, and was very impressed by his performance as a holy-man who is forced into this quandary of being humane and obeying his thirst as a vampire. (SPOILER) After the initial premise of him surviving the defective blood transfusion, he starts to crave blood and discovers his super strength and his flying ability. The screen shots do his transition phase without overbearing on exposition. He starts drinking the blood of the dying and those who wish to be euthanized for moral reasons. The oft tragic and dysfunctional love affair the priest has with the manipulative Tae-joo is very riveting as they are played by The Host&#39;s Kanh-ho Song and actress OK-vin Kim. The special effects are properly placed in the backdrop and while it doesn&#39;t offer anything new in the ways of stunts and CGI, it didn&#39;t impose itself into the plot driven and character developed premise. The story and the pivotal plot points are very perverse and grotesque yet very original in its own Korean style. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#39;t many negatives I can say about Bakjwi. Sometimes I ask myself if the priests transition phase could have showed more of the priest having an emotional crisis with his transformation, but then again this would have made the movie 3 hours long. The movie was long to begin with. On the same token, vampires really don&#39;t have much in the way of expressing emotions to begin with. As mentioned before, this movie is very tragic, so don&#39;t expect anything hopeful while watching this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Bakjwi is delightfully dark, morbid and original. I strongly recommend this movie for serious viewers who are past the teenage phase of Twilight. This is definitely the Korean answer to the Swedish Let The Right One In, which is also a good movie.

Dudley Moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic. This film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli, and a few others, this film could have been a disaster. It is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood (the &#34;psycho&#34;-like music at the wedding fight), but the acting overcomes it. The character Arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comments. But he develops well into a more mature, well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will. The end is fairly corny, though. I wont give it away, but it could be improved. Worth seeing many times.

In Cold Blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry. Capote coined the phrase &#34;nonfiction novel&#34; to describe the book on which this film is based, and the spirit of that form was carried over into the film script, which he co-wrote. Despite the fact that we were well into the era of color film, Richard Brooks elected to present this film in black and white to underscore both the starkness of the landscape and the bleakness of the story. This is the first problem with the TV remake --color changes the tone of the story. In addition, the confinement of shooting a film for TV makes reduces the options of how the shots are framed and focused. As a result, we lose the dramatic clash which makes the second part of the original film (police interviews, trial, imprisonment, and execution) so claustrophobic. On the small screen, it&#39;s just another version of Law and Order spin-offs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollywood&#39;s search for scripts continuously takes it back to movies that were successful in another age. Usually, that&#39;s a mistake, and this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the actors are competent. The script is OK. The directing doesn&#39;t get in the way. It&#39;s just that the movie doesn&#39;t work as well as the original precision instrument. It doesn&#39;t hook the viewer into the ambivalence toward Smith and Hickock that the original film provokes. At the end of the TV version, we are left with the feeling: &#34;Ho hum, who cares?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the original first, on as large a screen as you can, then watch the TV version simply to understand why the first one was such an important film in 1967.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#39;t hurt to also go on line and read a bit about Capote and the original book. It will help you to understand the extraordinary effort he put into the material, and also some of the controversy surrounding both the book and the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually only gave this a 4 because I save the bottom 3 rankings for true bombs--the kind that enrage you about having been sucked into spending an

I can&#39;t honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of John Landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981 . I suppose you can&#39;t really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in London: An American tourist visits a famous European capital , he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague , he embarks ( Pardon the pun ) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession , he turns into a werewolf , he&#39;s visited by apparitions of his dead victims , etc etc . and reading the previous line I&#39;ve just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed . The difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the Landis movie is &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this Paris based movie there&#39;s no scenes that really stand out . There&#39;s no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he&#39;s going to get back home with no money or clothes , there&#39;s no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves and there&#39;s no spectacular climax . AAWIP does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour ? I&#39;m thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone he&#39;s got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms ! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there&#39;s no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up . You really do feel sorry for the protagonist&#39;s fate and dilemma in the London movie , here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script . There&#39;s also a large number of plot holes visible . Is this the first time The Lunar Club have carried out a massacre ? If not then aren&#39;t large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world&#39;s press ? Why haven&#39;t the police got leads ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone else has mentioned it and so will I - The visuals are poor . Look at the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower , it&#39;s painfully obvious that it&#39;s achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish CGI . I won&#39;t put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on CGI ( The major problem with AAWIP is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic ) but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation . To be fair it&#39;s reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didn&#39;t stretch that far . But at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didn&#39;t need to be made and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment

This is a weird and compelling film. The topic, about the atom bombs created at Los Alamos, NM in the USA and used on Japan during the latter part of World War II, is huge, and of course deeply disturbing. The film&#39;s plot takes on a lot of heavy issues and the actors have to carry much of the creative tension. I had never seen the film, or was much interested in it I have to admit, until I read the book &#34;Smoking in Bed: Conversations with Bruce Robinson.&#34; Robinson wrote the story and screenplay. I think the film was better than I expected from reading Robinson&#39;s point of view in the conversations about it, but I can see how he thought it got derailed. I think Paul Newman is pretty good, but is somehow at bottom, miscast. He&#39;s too Hollywood. At one point, a big, mean-looking guy storms into Newman&#39;s office and has such a striking presence, I immediately thought he should be playing the character Newman is playing. The other lead, who plays the head scientist, is also fairly good, but somehow not brilliant enough to portray the huge angst that goes with the part - the immense responsibility for creation of an ultimate machine of death and destruction. One of the more effective characters seems to be a composite personality, played by John Cusack. He is oddly affecting throughout, and in the end, is the character whose fate really hits home and who made me think most vividly of the fate of more than 200,000 Japanese people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

This picture was released in May of 1979 starring Playboy Playmate Susan Kiger as Honey Shayne, Playboy Playmate Lisa London as O&#39;Hara and Playboy Playmate Pamela Jean Bryant as Terri Lynn. In one of the most delicious sec comedies in drive-in history a bevy of bouncing young lovelies all come together in a tale of battling bikinied sorority sisters who will stop at nothing to bare everything. So what does H.O.T.S really stand for? You&#39;re going to have to watch the movie to get the answer. You see, the girls are having there problems with the society girls on campus that make them out to be nothing but sex craved maniacs. Therefore, the girls set out to discredit the society girls no matter what they have to do to get the job done. In addition, cut up in this mess is the Dean of the college who wants to dismantle the group of girls before they grow out of control. I loved this movie especially Lisa London. I thought her acting was fantastic and I&#39;m disappointed that she didn&#39;t get other acting jobs. Based on the three playmates alone I give this movie 10 weasel stars.

Every review I have read so far seems to have missed a crucial point. Shakespeare wrote for the accent and the pronunciation just as he did for northerners in other plays. The Scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and affects profoundly what is said and the way it is taken. So, listen again and note the difference. The play is well done and the rhythm of the words are so much better than that provided by people using received, polite, well- enunciated English. I am reminded of the time a teacher in a school in Leicester, unknowingly, asked me, age 14, to read a piece of Walter Scott which was written in the tone of the Border. I come from the Border and when I read it as it should be read it made all the difference.

Well to start with Rajkumar Santoshi is not a comedy film maker ,and this is really unfortunate because the only comedy film he has made is a masterpiece.This film is really funny .Loud in bits ,overacted in a few scenes but still the dialogues r really laugh riots and characters r really full of fun . Story line in simple a Billionaire&#39;s daughter come to India for marriage and Two young chaps r behind her ,the story has a twist as well with a connection of a Gangster .Aamir playing a street smart guy Amar has played his role with brilliance and Salman has played the role of an innocent stupid to perfection.Raveena has done fine ,but Karshima really turns irritating in some sequences .But real show stealer r Paresh Rawal and Shakti Kapoor ,they enter the frame and automatically u start laughing . Overall such an enjoyable film that u can watch it any no. of times without getting bored.

I once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar noise violation for sneezing after midnight - so, needless to say, I can easily relate to Polanski&#39;s &#34;The Tenant.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I also enjoy the film for other reasons. I&#39;m not sure that it works, on the whole - the Polanski character&#39;s descent into paranoia and madness, which takes up the final half hour or so, seems rather jarring and bizarre. Ebert, for one, was totally unconvinced, and he slapped the movie with a vicious one-star review. But I think that individual scenes and moments work beautifully, so even though I don&#39;t quite understand the whole film - what does Egyptology have to do with it, for example? - I still have an overall positive impression of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the obnoxious friend portrayed by Bernard Fresson, for example. God, how many times have I settled for having stupid friends like that instead of no friends at all! I love the movie theater scene - the funniest &#34;making out&#34; moment in the history of film, I&#39;d say. And boy, do I love Isabelle Adjani - she&#39;s so foxy in this movie, it&#39;s almost unbelievable. And she gives a great performance, as always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polanski is a good actor, too; I don&#39;t agree with the occasional disparaging remarks made about his performance here. His character is supposed to be low-key and thoughtful, so his low-key performance fits. I, for one, found him perfectly sympathetic - though he did lose me a bit when he started dressed in drag for no clearly discernible reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the movie&#39;s obscure. And slow. But it captures the alienating qualities of apartment living - something I&#39;ve done entirely too much of - so I dig it. It&#39;s funny how all you need is a common reference point, and suddenly a weirdo movie like this becomes deeply significant! Definitely worth picking up for pocket change on DVD.

(spoilers?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve heard some gripe about the special effects. But that should detract from the movie. THe movie is a suspense film. And it&#39;s very good at that. So from that stand point, this movie rocks. Franke rocks. Enjoy to one&#39;s plastic hearts content. So no complaints for this movie. Unless you watch the english dub, which is a total farce. It creates the illusion it&#39;s a B movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint I do have is the music video on the dvd. It doesn&#39;t say who sings it. I&#39;d love to know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: 10/10 Entertainment : 10/10 Replayable: 5/10

Spending an hour seeing this brilliant Dan Finnerty and his &#34;Dan Band&#34; perform their special on Bravo is the most enjoyable hour I&#39;ve ever spent watching TV. This young man (Dan) is such an incredible talent, as a singer, performer and even dancer. He can go from the cheesiest of ballad pop songs, all of which have only been sung by women, to hip-hop, rock, also songs written for women.. This guy can do anything. I&#39;ve seen him live at least 11 times, so I was not expecting just how well that his show would adapt to a television or film format, but all reservations went away instantly when the show started because of Dan&#39;s overwhelming star quality.Do yourself a favor and watch this, or better yet, buy it.

It&#39;s great to see Jorja Fox in a role where she gets to smile a lot. Also loved hearing her sing. Nice change to see her out of her CSI/West Wing/ER roles. The movie itself was entertaining, but it seemed skip some explanation in a lot of parts. Several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your imagination to figure out why. Each character was quirky though and in some cases, I couldn&#39;t wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next. This movie wasn&#39;t full of squeaky clean people, but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes, feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them.

I used to watch Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10. It was on right after Bay City Rollers. I saw it come on to Family Channel one day, and taped it for my then three-year old daughter. I&#39;d forgotten all the things I&#39;d loved as a child, the magic flute, the zoom broom, Witcheepoo&#39;s makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show is decidedly low tech. The mayor is surely a precedent to Mayor McCheese, and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes. But kids love this stuff. They would way, way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high-tech computer animation. There is (mild) slapstick, but no adult themes such as sex or people dying, and kids accept Jimmy&#39;s schemes. Kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire, and I loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought Witchypoo was flying overhead. The music is old, but you really get used to it, and my daughter really loved it. She used to sing &#34;different is hard, different is lonely&#34; in the car. My daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months, and it&#39;s still one of her favourites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is in the works. I really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don&#39;t do anything like computer-animating characters etc. I think a whole new generation would love Pufnstuf.

Dreadful horror sequel to &#34;The Howling&#34;. This picks off with Karen White&#39;s funeral (she was killed at the end of the first film). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee sadly) arrives there and tells Karen&#39;s brother Ben (Reb Brown) that Karen was a werewolf. He&#39;s going to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning) the head werewolf. Ben and a coworker of Karens (Annie McEnroe) join him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A terrible script, bad direction, inept editing and truly horrendous acting by Brown and McEnroe single handedly sink this one. The werewolf effects are mostly kept in the dark--for good reason! They&#39;re terrible when you see them. Subpar special effects also--although I DID like the cartoon lightning that comes from Danning&#39;s fingers. There&#39;s also a werewolf orgy which is particularly stupid and Danning takes off her top at least EIGHT TIMES during the closing credits! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few good things--I found the village in Transylvania amusing--it looks like it came from a Universal horror flick from the 1930s! There are interesting camera tricks between transition scenes; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good in this--but they can&#39;t save it. Really--WHY did they do this? Where that they hard up for money??? This is one of IMDb&#39;s lowest rated movies. That alone should tell you something. Supposedly Danning was horrified when she saw the movie--I can understand why! A must-miss.

This film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt. A triumph in the post-war period, it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema. Recently, it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most even-handed representation of soldiers&#39; integration into post-war life ever made (and that most definitely includes films such as &#34;The Deer Hunter.&#34;) I like it, but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tale is a simple one. Three very different servicemen who have mustered out after World War II (The Big One!) fly home to their Midwest town and try to resume, or create, civilian lives. One has a disability, one has a cushy job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to go on but determination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. Fredric March won the Best Actor Oscar for playing an old Sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for &#34;It&#39;s a Wonderful Life,&#34; which also deserved the Best Picture Award, but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. March has one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real WWII hero Pappy Boyington, and otherwise is solid but unspectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going against the grain here, but I thought that Myrna Loy, who played March&#39;s wife, was justly ignored by the Academy. I detected barely a hint of warmth from her. In fact, I kept thinking she was going to slap Frederic March for annoying her. She practically grimaced every time they were together. Something was definitely missing there, in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than joyfulness. I think all this nonsense about her being &#34;the perfect wife&#34; is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal. You may disagree with that, but the Academy voters apparently did not. She is a major problem with this film, terribly miscast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dana Andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero, then winds up behind the counter again, is amazing. He is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. But then he chances upon March&#39;s daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic turn), and fireworks explode. Both are great, but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film. Some moments of pure soap opera intrude, punctuated by the all-time classic line, &#34;I&#39;m going to bust that marriage up!&#34; The romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war, that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of uplifting, now we come to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic quality to his acting, or is it non-acting, that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then. Taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best in all cinema, is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. &#34;I&#39;m lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some of the boys.&#34; Truly great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film has some moments that soar. It also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps. Take the good with the bad and see this one for the high points.

For all its wonderful images, for all of its good intentions, this just comes off as yet another disgustingly one-sided, over-glorified, self-promoting propaganda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The message is simple, &#34;All Japanese fighting on the Kokoda Track were sadistic, malicious f*** sticks who enjoyed gutting every last Aussie troop, cutting their throats before beheading them.&#34; Not only does Kokoda pick up on &#34;Gallipoli&#34;&#39;s only flaw (that the enemy are faceless, nameless, and apparently inhumane), but manages to prove quite the opposite to Weir&#39;s masterpiece. Instead of giving us a perfect film with one flaw, we have a horrible mess with one redeeming feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s start off with this: we&#39;re, without any comfortable adapting to the characters, introduced to these apparently quite laid back, two-dimensional people who we never... EVER get to sympathize with. We&#39;re kept at such a distance that even when we could so easily relate to the characters, they find a way to keep us away. That alone is a sickening feature, as it drives us from the very plot, helps the horrible pacing to leave us with a lasting impression, and makes it so much easier to see the contrast between an overtly sentimental ending and an otherwise lackluster body of a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, it drags us through a painful journey (not just for us, but apparently for them) and just as it should end, we&#39;re thrown into another eye-roller of a skirmish that ends faster than it began. So, for the as yet STILL uninformed: when it should end, it starts up again, only to end when we expect more. S***! It&#39;s just a confusing and agonizing pace!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to the ultimatum: this is meant to educate us on the events of the Kokoda track. It doesn&#39;t come close. Not only does it detail a very small, insignificant part of the campaign (sprinkling a little &#34;mateship&#34; on top in an attempt to make it relevant), but it succeeds in doing the one thing a film as important as this should be does, it makes us NOT care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, my eyes were constantly glued to my watch the entire time. The audience around me, all proudly Australian, bickering as they came in about how great the film is going to be, groaned, moaned, and whined in disappointment as every one of the painful ninety-five minutes droned on (for a short running time, it felt like Apocalypse Now: difference being that Apocalypse Now was a good film and deserved the three hours it got) and on to the point where suicide could wholeheartedly be an alternative should it be mandatory for this film to be watched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, considering how much the TV has been advertising this trash, I&#39;d say it is mandatory, in a subliminal sense of the word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch if you like pretty images. Though you&#39;d do better watching The Constant Gardener or Gallipoli anyway, since they have superior cinematography and ACTUAL plots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: *

I must say that I am fairly disappointed by this &#34;horror&#34; movie. I did not get scared even once while watching it. It also is not very suspenseful either.... I was able to guess the ending half way through the movie... So.. what&#39;s left?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Ring&#34; is a trully scary movie... I wish other movies would stop copying from it (e.g. the trade-mark: long hair). Please give me some originality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not recommend this movie.

As far as the Muppet line goes, however, this is not the best, nor the second best. This was marketed towards the kiddies, but has some dark, and emotionally upsetting adult moments, to which parents may not wish to expose their children. One of which showcases Miss Piggy going &#34;postal&#34; in a jealous rage, which lasts basically throughout the duration of this work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, however, the story is progressive, and highly entertaining. One scene in which Joan Rivers and Miss PIggy go berserk in a department store is simply hilarious! And there are other parts of this work which contain the same level of levity and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this very much, and enjoy it still today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rates a 7.6/10 from...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Fiend :.

This Film was one that I have waited to see for some time. I was glad to find it has been everything anticipated. The writing of this film has been so finely crafted and researched far beyond what is seen by the audience. I found it amusing that so many people watching will not read between some very important lines but indeed if not the movie will make sense in a different way and is very brilliant. The film has many stories and characters woven together around this one Character Kilo , a Man whom has rose from the streets amidst many woes and become a very powerful criminal. After spending some time in Prison Kilo finds a loophole in the justice system and through a disturbing turn of events is released only to find everything is not at all what it seems. Kilo Finds himself going up against the higher realm of society and Political royalty in order to make clear how important a Man&#39;s Word is and stands for. A war begins as the street is in arms against Lords of wealth and corrupt Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A build up to explosive and powerful non stop twists and turns. This film will leave you riveted. I found the cast of this movie to be outstanding and is not a Movie to be ignored. Excellent. Go Rent It Today!!

&#34;The Shop Around the Corner&#34; is one of the great films from director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, it&#39;s filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart .They&#39;re the type of character actors that Hollywood sadly no longer employs. In fact, the film itself is the kind of movie that Hollywood doesn&#39;t make anymore. (The makers of &#34;You&#39;ve Got Mail&#34; claim their film to be a remake, but that&#39;s just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise.) Anyway, if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940&#39;s, you&#39;ll find &#34;The Shop Around the Corner&#34; to be nothing short of wonderful. Just as good with repeat viewings. Enjoy!

The plot was dull, the girls were sickening and the supposed Italian male lead had clearly never heard an Italian accent.Someone said the boys were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people. There were literally no redeeming features about this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the Olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business. They have no place in it.

I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this film. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful, and warm. Andie MacDowell&#39;s performance was nuanced and vulnerable. For once, the director of a MacDowell film did not make her beauty another character in the film. The romance between Kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well. Her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life. Imelda Stalinson, who has been a MVP in so many British films, does a great job in this. There is some tragedy in this but I think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting, clean direction, and witty writing.The film quality is excellent and the music is good, too, though unavailable on sound track.

I just saw the third week of Stephen Kings&#39; Nightmares and Dreamscapes mini series; meaning, I saw 6 episodes so far. I have to say that the stories are really weak. I have read Stephen King&#39;s Skeleton Crew, a collection of his short stories that was published way back. I recall most of the stories were average to poor but there was one that was really excellent, if not outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#39;m trying to say is that just because this mini series is from a collection of stories from Stephen King does not mean that it will be any good. In fact, if his previous collection of short stories are of any indication, then most of this mini series will be average to poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Stephen King&#39;s defense, I have not read these new short stories. Perhaps they are good as stories in a book and not readily adaptable to television, or perhaps it was the fault of the scriptwriters in trying to write an interesting script. Who knows. Also, these short stories may have been made exclusively for this mini series and not not for print purpose. Maybe that may have been the problem. If Stephen King had submitted these crap stories to an editor, I am sure the editor would have immediately told him to make it more interesting because as is, it is simply boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is clear from all of this is that the problem is with the stories/script and not the actors and actresses because this mini series has some excellent people acting on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing this mini series really makes me appreciate those old &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; series. Each series was only half an hour but it was compelling and riveting. I don&#39;t understand why this mini series could not accomplish similar feat. I am sure this mini series had a good deal of money to make a good mini series but unfortunately, something must not have clicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, this week there were two episodes shown. The first involved a horror story writer who buys a picture drawn by an artist who committed suicide. The writer begins to see changes in the picture as he is driving homeward. Feeling uncomfortable, he throws away the painting but it keeps appearing near him. Also, the portrait of an individual in that picture is killing people and is out to kill him. (I will not even mention the second episode for this week involving criminals and their loot because it was even more boring than this episode!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This premise is interesting and so the story should be good but after seeing it, I was frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story as well as extraneous materials that was shown that did nothing to help the story. After the last scene, I was left with more questions than answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried for 3 weeks to get into this mini series but it was just too aggravating due to poor stories/script. If this was a movie, I would have recommended that people should wait for the movie to come out on cable or such. I would not even recommend that it be rented in your video store. However, given that this is on TNT, a cable channel, I would say if you have not seen it already, then try it for one week. If you do not like it that week, then you will not like the past series nor the future ones, since they all share the same boring trait.

A surprisingly good movie! It has quite a few good jokes thru out the whole movie. The only negative thing is that some scenes go to the extremes to show just how stupid the two main characters are. We get it, stupid blondes, get on with it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot just barely dodges being called &#34;corny&#34;. And boobies are always a plus altho the movie for some strange reason doesn&#39;t play with that card very much even tho the plot line introduces two black haired women who act as the evil counter part of our two blondes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, a good movie to watch. I almost gave it an 8/10, but let&#39;s not get crazy.

Brilliant film, the next best film to The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on an original VHS and i haven&#39;t seen this film for 15 years but still as good as it was back then. The acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse but it those features that make this film (and many other old fashioned Chinese kung-fu movies) great. The choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic. I have never seen the 36th chamber of shaolin but know it is the same film but Gordon liu plays San Te but San Te in Thr Return To The 36th Chamber is played by a different character. It has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung-fu.

I was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received, but after viewing it I was terribly disappointed. Slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a Todd Solondz type of disturbing family reality sans Todd&#39;s brand of humor. The story drags along and each scene is worse than the last. Maybe I missed the point, but if this film is an example of every girl&#39;s growing up experience I am glad to be a man.

What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly! Not only do these shows have great story lines, they also throw you into them, get your mind racing, and your blood pumping. The original outer limits was a black and white in the 60&#39;s right, These shows made a triumphant comeback the likes of which I have never seen! The new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker was fun to watch, but the New OUTER LIMITS is where it&#39;s at! If you have not seen: I implore you to please check these episodes out, and you will see exactly what I mean! LONG LIVE THE NEW OUTER LIMITS!!!!!!!!!!!!

As the &#39;70&#39;s drew to a close, rumours began to fly in the entertainment industry about the possible return of Sean Connery to the role he had made famous back in 1962 - James Bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cubby Broccoli was asked on location in Brazil during the making of &#39;Moonraker&#39; by the B.B.C.&#39;s Barry Norman how he viewed the prospect. Understandably, the producer was reluctant to commit himself to an opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When &#39;Moonraker&#39; opened, Bond fans were outraged by what they perceived to be a cheapening of the character, and the jumping onto the &#39;Star Wars&#39; bandwagon much as &#39;Live &amp; Let Die&#39; had done with the blaxploitation craze a few years earlier. Many publicly vocalised their hope that Connery would return, if only to show Eon how a real Bond movie should look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years of legal battles followed. The original script, entitled &#39;James Bond Of The Secret Service&#39; ( later retitled &#39;Warhead&#39; ) was written by Kevin McClory, Len Deighton, and Connery, was never filmed, and remains one of the great unmade movie blockbusters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new script, closer to the &#39;Thunderball&#39; storyline, was commissioned. It was written by Lorenzo Semple Junior, best known as the man who put the camp into &#39;Batman&#39;. He had also written &#39;The Parallax View&#39;, one of the decade&#39;s finest conspiracy thrillers. Feeling the script needed a British touch, Connery brought in Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, writers of hit British sitcoms &#39;The Likely Lads&#39; and &#39;Porridge&#39;. The witty title was suggested by Connery&#39;s wife Micheline. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Never Say Never Again&#39; opened just before Christmas 1983 to a shower of critical praise; normally sensible critics were so ecstatic at Connery&#39;s return they ignored all other aspects of the film. Many used it to viciously attack the Roger Moore series, particularly that year&#39;s &#39;Octopussy&#39;. In truth, &#39;Octopussy&#39; is superior in every respect. &#39;Never&#39; lacks the excitement and spectacle one associates with Bond, at times it looks like a made-for-T.V. movie. The story had been done before and better in 1965&#39;s &#39;Thunderball&#39;, hence &#39;Never&#39; was always going to come off second best. It was also hampered by not being part of the official series, meaning that Monty Norman&#39;s &#39;James Bond Theme&#39; and Maurice Binder&#39;s gun-barrel logo could not be used. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Bond, Connery is magnificent, effortlessly stepping back into his most famous role. Playing Bond as an older, wiser agent worked. Barbara Carrera landed her best movie role as villainous &#39;Fatima Blush&#39;, a lady whose love for murder is such she dances after ( so she thinks ) killing Bond. Kim Basinger smolders as &#39;Domino&#39;. As S.P.E.C.T.R.E. agent &#39;Maximillian Largo&#39;, Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a chilling performance. A major disappointment though is Max Von Sydow as &#39;Blofeld&#39;. The posters gave the impression he would be a major character, in fact he appears only in a few scenes. With a stronger script, he could have been one of the all-time great Bond villains. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Never&#39; promised to be a throwback to the early Eon Bonds such as &#39;From Russia With Love&#39;, but did not deliver. The gadgets were there, but were used almost apologetically. Bond&#39;s rocket-firing motorcycle was a tired gimmick even in the &#39;60&#39;s. The film tried to compete with Eon&#39;s Bonds in terms of humour. Bond saving himself by throwing his own urine sample into an assassin&#39;s face is a farcical a moment as any you will find in &#39;Moonraker&#39;. But the nadir comes with the introduction of Rowan Atkinson as bumbling Foreign Office official &#39;Nigel Small-Fawcett&#39;. He gives a performance so staggeringly awful you wonder if he thought he was in a Footlights revue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michel Legrand&#39;s music is horrible, the man seems to never to have seen a Bond film in his life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the film was a financial success, viewed years later it stands as the weakest Bond of the &#39;80&#39;s. Connery himself was disappointed with it, and not did act in a movie again for some years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1983 was a good year for 007 maniacs, in addition to the Connery and Moore movies, George Lazenby did a delightful cameo in the made-for-T.V. &#39;Return Of The Man From U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair&#39;.

I was a kid .. crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dancing .. He was and is the greatest of all times. Few days ago a friend gave me a present .. &#34;Moonwalker&#34; DVD .. I just couldn&#39;t believe it! So I took my time and saw the movie again.. After a lot of years, and it kicked me back in time. I almost cried. Not because of Michael Jackson but of the good old times I remembered back than when I went to his concerts, enjoying music and dancing. The movie gave me some other perspective than back then when i was a kid. You can truly see the parody that Michael went through his life. Thank You Michael Jackson to bring me back to those great times, to Your great music and dancing. It&#39;s a shame that people has forgotten You .. I didn&#39;t because You gave me great moments with your music .. All the best to You where ever You are out there ..

I think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated. When a person comes to watch a TV show, what does he look out for? It is to enjoy that he watches a show, unless he/she is a critic or a person who analyzes story. But most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the office/school. It makes you laugh and it is not just humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If any such family existed in real world, it would be a role model for us to follow. But this is a TV show, and not a real family, and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television. The very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it, whatever be the comments later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it, but would take back a message however childish that message be. Those Jesse&#39;s talks with Michelle are extremely touching, if one doesn&#39;t think of it as childish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say after watching every show of Full House, there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows.

&#34;Stealing Time&#34; actually dates back to 2001 when it was mysteriously titled &#34;Rennie&#39;s Landing&#34;. Which explains how director Marc Fusco was able to afford this cast of now established television/movie actors in what is obviously an extremely low budget production. About ten minutes into the film you understand why this thing never got a theatrical release after it made the film festival rounds several years ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its recent distribution by Franchise Pictures probably reflects a perception that the rising popularity of certain cast members can be milked to recover some of the modest production costs. Although not a great addition to anyone&#39;s resume, young actors have done worse things when they were desperately seeking acting work of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Facinelli, Ethan Embry, Scott Foley and Charlotte Ayanna play college friends who do an early &#34;Big Chill&#34; reunion and compare war stories about the failure of reality to measure up to their dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately nothing else happens, absolutely nothing. Yes Alec (Facinelli) dreams about a liquor store holdup and a bank robbery, which are then &#34;cheaply and lamely&#34; staged to completely inappropriate music. It is the least suspenseful bank job since W.C. Fields was the guard in &#34;The Bank Dick&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone can point to any moment in &#34;Stealing Time&#34; where something &#34;actually&#34; happens I would like to know about it, because as far as I can tell, not a thing happens in the whole film. Perhaps Fusco, through incessant visual reflections, is trying to say something profound about taking control of one&#39;s life before it is too late. Like &#34;St. Elmo&#39;s Fire&#34; the movie is littered with every profound thought ever uttered by a young adult who has left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt Fusco was going for a kind of Howard Hawks Young Professionals in Action &#34;Only Angels Have Wings&#34; motif. Then again, I&#39;m sure I was reading much too much into the film. After all, things actually happen Howard Hawks films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, what do I know? I&#39;m only a child.

I&#39;ve seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conversations between Nimi and her mother plus Nimi and Matthew are very touching. The Nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation; if we knew why Matthew was in the South of France in the first place, the scenes following Matthew being found in his car would be more understandable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Optimum Releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in London and is not longer available to see. I hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it.

This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies. Horrible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There wasn&#39;t a continuous minute where there wasn&#39;t a fight with one monster or another. There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Examples&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait......it hypnotizes (stings) its victim and wraps them up.....uh hello????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;And the whole machine vs. humans theme WAS the Matrix..or Terminator.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more examples but why waste the time? And will someone tell me what was with the Nazi&#39;s?!?! Nazi&#39;s???? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion. The movie could not decide if it was a children&#39;s movie or an adult movie and wasn&#39;t much of either. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.

I have to start off by apologizing because I thought the first 75-80% of this film was hilarious. It&#39;s mostly because of Brad Pitt&#39;s performance. Spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting by all involved was quite good but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in all respects. I&#39;m not a giant Pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brutal,Honest,Gritty. All good words to describe this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind Early&#39;s violence isn&#39;t explained. It is explained but they thankfully don&#39;t have to go into graphic detail to get their point across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective. I think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie. Underrated.

A great British Indy movie! Fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters make for some hilarious drug-fuelled set pieces that Cheech and Chong would be proud of. Great to see Phil Daniels back on the big screen (even if he has swapped sides since Quadrophenia!) and Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies! Loved the final fight scene with it&#39;s nod to Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he set himself on fire on Top of the Pops!...he&#39;s not acting....he really is a bona-fide British hippie!!! You don&#39;t have to be a biker to enjoy this and it&#39;s straight into my Friday night post-pub repeat viewing collection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this film a go and you won&#39;t be disappointed.

I was looking through TV Guide last night and saw a movie starring Heather Grahm on, who I liked in movies like Boogie Nights, and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. It started out ok, but you could tell the story was lacking, and at about half way through, it started to deteriorate. I do not remember this movie being in the theaters, and I&#39;m sure if it was, it wasn&#39;t there long. The acting was stale and unconvincing, the dialogue was silly and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid. Definately one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I like movies like the ones this has been compared to like Fight Club, but this one doesn&#39;t come close!! Heather Grahm has done much better things since. I gave it a 2 out of 10 but thats because I clicked on the wrong number, I meant to give it a 1.

This film is underrated. I loved it. It was truly sweet and heartfelt. A family who struggles but isn&#39;t made into a dysfunctional family which is so typical of films today. The film didn&#39;t make it an issue that they have little money or are Dominican Republican the way Hollywood have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead the issue is Victor is immature and needs to grow up. He does, slowly, by the film&#39;s end. He has a ways to go, but it was a heartfelt attempt to move forward. His grandmother is very cute and the scene where the little boy throws up had me laughing for the longest time. A truly heartfelt indie

I liked this movies. Its a another Yash raj film which you know will look good on screen, all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice... Another rule of Yash raj&#39;s film is that either hero or heroine;s have only one or none parent. Think back to all of those films.. MPK Suman didn&#39;t have mom, HMAPK Salman didn&#39;t have parents, AND FINAL rule is that you are 90% likely to see Alock Nath crying...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is good too. Its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained. There is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough. The little kid (hero&#39;s nephew) is well placed and deliver very good one liners. The actress is very pretty but shy you wouldn&#39;t get that in real life. this film doesn&#39;t have massively big happy families living in BIG house which I thou was a good Idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films. There will be lots of women crying at the end of the film. There isn&#39;t a strong message from this film but its a good watch. If you are married (arranged marriage)the film will remind you of what you went through. And if you are not it will inform and may be scare you ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very good looking film. No big plots or twists but a very gentle film, very much like Bollywood classic.

How bad idea was to remake an almost Oscar -worthy film?! MOSTHLY MARTHA is MUCH MORE BETTER, has deepness, finesse and so on and mainly: a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role (Martina Gedeck). It&#39;s a joke and ugliness with the handsome Aaron and the whole atmosphere... again a ridiculous effort from Hollywood. There are more and more remake and the films are full with schemes.. Isn&#39;t anybody there who can create a good and newly script? Or this is a safety solution to make remake or movies from the well-tried cartoon figures? The films are getting much less interesting nowadays. Oh yes: If you want to see a REALLY good movie watch the original one. It&#39;s definitely worth.

I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I guess she&#39;s the kind of actress who had better not act before camera, but just be herself. She did that, and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown. In this movie, however, she did try to add in more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, so that she looked more like a sober editor. While in the other half, she totally set herself back in her daily track, and I just couldn&#39;t tell her to be an editor any way. Therefore, her performance is not enduring in this film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film,on the whole, is attracting and inspiring. the character of Young is full and reasonable. Anyway, the film tells a big and sophisticated story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only big defect is that it didn&#39;t show a turning point of the hero and heroine&#39;s love story. I am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story, because that is rather unclear for the two persons.

Lame B-horror that takes itself too damn seriously considering its subject matter concerns an aging old dear who has been turned into a creature of the night by a lodger who has come to rent a room from her. When said lodger is killed off, Mom has to go out to feed on her own and that causes some family strain and also garners some attention from the authorities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is that this film should have brought THE FUNNY. It failed to do so although it did have some mild gore and schlocky creature makeup effects to keep the B-movie crowd happy. I&#39;ve seen worse but I wouldn&#39;t give this one a rec--4.5/10.

SNL is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a Short skit on SNL is a little dumb minded. It&#39;s NOTHING like SNL, it&#39;s just a stupid piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder but fails. Although Jon Heder is only funny in Napoleon Dynamite Andy tries his hardest and people think he&#39;s funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was decently funny with Andy was the pool part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They could have made the &#34;Quiet place&#34; a lot better if they didn&#39;t make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part where he&#39;s pronouncing his H&#39;s more is retarded. They try going with it too long and half the time it looks like Andy is laughing while he acts...he&#39;s a horrible actor and doesn&#39;t deserve to be in a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year old level of comedy. Which is about half the United States.

Coming from the &#34;druggie&#34; generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll &amp; Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren&#39;t into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve seen it I can&#39;t remember but a few things. I would have to say the funniest part was when Dr. Jekyll dozed off on his lab table and inhaled the straw, while snoring, then snorted up the powdered drug he had invented. Funniest thing I&#39;d ever seen in a movie.

I could watch this movie ALL DAY! I LOVE it. Probably my all time favorite movies. But, by the way, &#34;badger1970&#34; there are a few parts with bad language, not TOO bad, but it&#39;s not exactly G rated. GREAT movie!!!!! I recommend it to everybody. Any way, it&#39;s making me type 10 lines of text, so I am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment. Okay... Still typing... This is getting annoying. Ugh. I still have four more to go. Anyway, WATCH THIS MOVIE! Even if you have already seen it. I DON&#39;T CARE! Has it been 10 lines yet? Nope. Only 2 more lines left. I don&#39;t even know why it wants me to do this. I think I am done. Wait a minute, I&#39;m NOT done, SORRY, people. I know it&#39;s torture listening to me. WEll, I suppose that you don&#39;t HAVE to read this comment... But you should, because I wrote it. I am probably done now. Finally, bye.

This movie was awful. The ending was absolutely horrible. There was no plot to the movie whatsoever. The only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice. If the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story, it would be worth watching. Instead, Robert DuVall&#39;s and James Earl Jones&#39; performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline...or lack thereof. Not only was I left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie....well an actual movie...not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only thing special was how Robert DuVall portrayed a rambling, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end. When the movie ended, I sat amazed...amazed that I sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while. It never happened! The cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and I realized that I had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning. It wasn&#39;t even a story. The entire movie takes place in a day&#39;s worth of time. That&#39;s it. It was one day in the life (and death) of some Southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (other than the movie Training Day)? The acting performances by the entire cast were excellent, but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie...if you can even call it a movie.

I first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it. Charles Dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine. His sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero. I have never been much of an Eddie Murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner: a bit of &#34;Axel Foley Through the Looking Glass&#34;. Charlotte Lewis is, to utilize a hackneyed phrase but the only one applicable, luminously gorgeous. Some scenes are wonderfully created: the dream sequence, the bird, the silly fight scenes, and the climactic confrontation. Through it all Murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an oriental myth, a stunned and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his oriental fantasy romp. Like that movie we have James Hong, the incomparable actor whose scenes, however short, raise the quality even of Derek. Since 1955 Hong has defined the fine supporting actor, the &#34;class act&#34; of his profession. &#34;The Golden Child&#34; is silly; it is not perfect; but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy, well worth watching. After four years I have seen &#34;The Golden Child&#34; again; I enjoyed it even more! It truly is great fun.

The Invisible Maniac starts as a young Kevin Dornwinkle (Kris Russell) is caught by his strict mother (Marilyn Adams) watching a girl (Tracy Walker) strip through his telescope... Cut to &#39;Twenty Years Later&#39; &amp; Kevin Dornwinkle (Noel Peters) is now a physics professor who claims to have discovered a way to turn things invisible using a &#39;mollecular reconstruction&#39; serum. However during a demonstration in front of his fellow scientists it fails &amp; they all laugh at him, Dornwinkle goes mad kills a few of them &amp; is locked away in a mental institute from which he escapes. Jump forward &#39;Two Weeks Later&#39; &amp; a group of summer college students discuss the tragic death of their physics teacher when the headmistress Mrs. Cello (Stephanie Blake as Stella Blalack) says that she has hired a replacement, yes you&#39;ve guessed it it&#39;s Dornwinkle. The student don&#39;t take to him &amp; treat him like dirt, however Dornwinkle has perfected his invisibility serum &amp; uses it to satisfy his perverted sexual urges &amp; his desire for revenge...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Co-written &amp; directed by Adam Rifkin wisely hiding under the pseudonym Rif Coogan (I wouldn&#39;t want my name to be associated with this turd of a film either) The Invisible Maniac is real bottom of the barrel stuff. The script by Rifkin, sorry Coogan &amp; Tony Markes is awful. It tries to be a teenage sex/comedy/horror hybrid that just fails in every department. For a start the sex is nothing more than a few female shower scenes &amp; a few boob shots, not much else I&#39;m afraid &amp; the birds in The Invisible Maniac aren&#39;t even that good looking. The comedy is lame &amp; every joke misses by the proverbial mile, this is the kind of film that thinks someone fighting an invisible man or having Henry (Jason Logan) a mute man trying to make a phone call is funny. The Invisible Maniac makes the Police Academy (1984 - 1994) series of films look like the pinnacle of sophistication! As for the horror aspect that too is lame. It&#39;s also an incredibly slow (it takes over half an hour before Dornwinkles even becomes invisible), dull, predictable, boring &amp; has highly annoying &amp; unlikable teenage character&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Rifkin or Coogan or whatever does absolutely nothing to try &amp; make The Invisible Maniac an even slightly enjoyable experience. There&#39;s no scares, tension or atmosphere &amp; as a whole the film is a real chore to sit through. He does nothing with the invisibility angle, just a few doors opening on their own is as adventurous as it gets. There is very little gore or violence, a bit of splashing blood, a few strangulations &amp; the only decent bit in the whole film when someone has their head blown off with a shotgun, unfortunately he was invisible at the time &amp; we only get to see the headless torso afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The budget must have been low, &amp; I mean really low because this is one seriously cheap looking film. Dornwinkles laboratory is basically two jars on his bedside cabinet! When he escapes from the mental institution he has all of one dog sent after him &amp; the entire school has about a dozen pupils &amp; two teachers. The Invisible Maniac is a poorly made film throughout it&#39;s 85 minute duration, I spotted the boom mike on at least one occasion... Lets just say the acting is of a low standard &amp; leave it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Invisible Maniac is crap, plain &amp; simple. I found no redeeming features in it at all, there are so many more better films out there you can watch so there is no reason whatsoever to waste your time on this rubbish. Definitely one to avoid.

I just managed to find a copy of &#34;Mission Cleopatra,&#34; which is not as easy as you would think for someone living in the United States. So far, I have only watched about the first 10 minutes of the film, and I can safely say that I laughed more in those 10 minutes than I did watching the entirety of the *first* live action Asterix movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am watching the dubbed version, and while the dubbing job is a little disconcerting, I have found the movie to be very funny and true to the book. I see that people on here have said that the dubbed version is very inferior to the subtitled version, that may very well be true, and after I watch the subtitled version (also on my DVD) I may have to come on here and alter my review. As it stands, though, I find it to be a very entertaining movie, and it more than makes up for the mess which they made out of the first movie.

I was very disappointed by this movie. Ms English who says that she is a fan of the original movie seemed to have taken a great piece of artistic work, and transformed it into a flat-lined &#34;ho-hum&#34; you&#39;ve come a long way baby production. I tried to like Meg Ryan&#39;s Mary Haines, but she was just boring. She didn&#39;t seem to feel anything about her husband&#39;s affair. There was no emotional struggle, no deep hurt. In the original 1939 movie Norma Shearer&#39;s Mary Haines felt betrayed, shocked, vulnerable, confused and angry. The 2008 production was more about some fake sisterhood theme, (Actually my wife&#39;s words)and didn&#39;t make you shed a tear or even chuckle. The only performances that were note worthy we&#39;re of Debra Messing, and Bette Midler. (I wanted more of Bette.) There was really no protagonist in this movie. The Sylvia Fowler character had too many sub themes to it. And Crystal Allen had no fire. The remake of the department store encounter with Annette Benning, and Miss Mendez was Luke warm. Also the pacing was slow as well. Obviously the 1939 version needed to be updated, but this one wasn&#39;t it. The reason that the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with &#34;man&#34; problems. A subject by the way which isn&#39;t out-dated. The magic of the original movie was that the movie was about both sexes, while you never saw the men.

Undeveloped/unbelievable story line,(by the time I sort of figured out where it was going, I no longer cared) bad casting.(come on... William Macy as a hit man???) bad directing,(have you ever seen Tracey Ullman perform SO badly?)(Was I supposed to care what happened to the unethical incompetent, uncaring John Ritter character?) bad script...( Really, I&#39;m not looking for a formula script but this was really awful) the only Really good thing in it was the kid. Ten lines? It&#39;s not OK if your comment is less than ten lines? COme on-- whose rules are those? Why can&#39;t I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines??? Isn&#39;t that kind of arbitrary? Why isn&#39;t it OK to have less than 10 lines of comment?

Every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie. This movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what&#39;s going on and you really want to view it for the second time. But after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie. This is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie, in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b**bs and lots of blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation. And don&#39;t forget to switch the light off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My points on different aspects:-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Direction = 9/10 Acting = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total = 9/10

I was a 20 year old college student living with the folks when I first saw this, and I&#39;ve never forgotten it. I&#39;m a huge Joan Hackett fan, and this film was perfect for her remarkable talent. I&#39;m so glad to see that so many other people have such a fond memory of seeing this. Naturally, it&#39;s not available on any media! It would be perfect to show on Lifetime, but because of its age, they won&#39;t. You never see anything there before the mid-eighties. I can still remember what made me watch it when it was first run: Rex Reed reviewed it in The New York Daily News, and he said that it was like a throwback to the great Hollywood films of the forties, and had it been made then, the Hackett and Grimes parts would have been played by Stanwyck and Crawford. Think about that! P.S. So sad that Joan Hackett left us so tragically young.

An excellent documentry. I personally remember this growing up in NYC in the early 80&#39;s. This movie is for anyone that wasn&#39;t around during that time period.This shows the one thing the African American Gay Underclass felt was solely theirs and the love and camadrie you see is real. The people are real and sadly few are still alive as this is being written. The balls are still held but not to the extent that they were in the the nineteen eighties. That time is gone forever. This is a good pre &#34;homo thug&#34; movie. When Queens were really proud to be extroverts. Goodbye to Storyville this is another era gone but greatly documented all hail film!

Ladies and Gentlemen,please don&#39;t get fooled by &#34;A Stanley Kubrick&#34; film tag.This is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made.Horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film.In Shining,there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive,foolish attempt made to create chilling horror.Everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality.All that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley. The hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too.A word about the actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost,lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do.There is not much to be said of a bald,colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor.No need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy.It cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor Kubrick is not alive to make any changes.

Really, truly, abysmally, garishly, awful. But actor Clayton Moore (the movie Lone Ranger) acquits himself competently as an actor. He&#39;s the only one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rare treat, for five minutes, if you want to plumb the depths of grotesquely transparent special effects, southern California as &#34;the moon&#34; (again and again and again), and acting so woodenly inept that it may be a spoof . . . except that it&#39;s clear that it isn&#39;t--no humor here, except unintentionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialogue may be worse than any of these other aspects, and the costumes . . . well, enough said. Plot? What plot? Bad guy (well, head bad guy) and his henchmen, including his earthly agent called Krog (listen carefully or you&#39;ll suspect it&#39;s a spoof on the name of McDonald&#39;s founder Ray Kroc)and his unbelievably inept gunsels (who, however, have handguns that never need reloading; as does Commando Cody, so there are numerous firefight standoffs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.

Beside the fact, that in all it&#39;s awesomeness this movie has risen beyond all my expectations, this masterpiece of cinema history portrait the overuse of crappy filters in it&#39;s best! Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show a brotherconflict with all there is to it. As usual a woman concieling her true intentions. The end came as surprising as unforssen as the killing of Keith Scott by his older brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scenes in &#39;wiking land&#39; are just as I remember it from my early time travels. - To be honest my strong passion for trash movies makes this one a must have in my never finished collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this movie to all the people in love with the most awesome brother cast from One Tree Hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Odin-

Chris and Andre are two average, ordinary teens. Misunderstood by some and picked on by others. But together they stand and all will pay. Together they form &#34;The Army of Two&#34;. They scheme and plan &#34;Zero Day&#34;. That day is when they decide to storm their high school and inevitably murder 14 people in cold blood. Told through the tapes that they made &#34;Zero Day&#34;, it is barely a fictionalized telling of the Columbine tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Zero Day&#34; is one of those movies that will mess with your head afterwards. The two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) do such a good job that their characters seem like almost any disenfranchised teen walking the street. Their performances were very believable, you kinda liked these guys and that was scary. Shot on video almost totally from the teen&#39;s perspectives &#34;Zero Day&#34; feels very real and authentic, like you are right there. These kids try to rationalize their actions to the viewer and the actors sell it to you. But be warned it does follow the tragedy from beginning to end and the ending makes be shocking and uneasy for some.

I watched DVD 1 only. The program proper may have 10 minutes of good information; otherwise it&#39;s snotty putdowns of religious people. It&#39;s as if director Brian Flemming only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm, and feels with these tools he can easily bludgeon his opposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Flemming wanders extensively into his own personal issues, and they take over the movie. It never gets back on topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Religious people are prone to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in abusive upbringings. Arguments from such victimized people seem irrational, and therefore unconvincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anti-religious people will want more data. We don&#39;t need to be told that religious people are nutty, any more than American Jews need to be told how annoying Christmas music gets by mid-December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the best scene, the Superintendent of Fleming&#39;s childhood Christian school rather insightfully confronts the director on his motivations. That seems like the most honest part of the movie, and it was too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Fleming were a bit more self-aware, he might have a good story in him about his own (past &amp; current) relationship to Christianity, and the abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And perhaps he could lend his &#34;Christ never walked the earth&#34; material to a more serious documentarian. I&#39;m not studying the writings of Saul/Paul to find out how air-tight this all is, but a quick browse of Wikipedia suggests most of these arguments are discredited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus interviews are pretty good, tho they don&#39;t bolster Fleming&#39;s thesis much. Sam Harris is a good spokesperson for the anti-religious POV, and he doesn&#39;t go light on those other, non-Christian religions. Harris also has some good (and easily Google&#39;d) interviews on Salon.com , Amazon.com , and Samharris.org .

This is a great movie to look at, since it so nicely directed by Andrzej Wajda but at the same time I wished the movie would had some more depth in it, in terms of its story. It&#39;s an historically relevant movie about the last days of the French revolution but yet the movie forgets to focus on the character&#39;s motivations making the movie perhaps a tad bit too shallow to consider this a brilliant and relevant movie to what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow it doesn&#39;t make the movie any less great to watch though. It&#39;s made with passion and eye for detail. every aspect about the movie is good looking, such as its settings, costumes and camera-work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the story still works out as powerful, though at the same time it could had been so much better and more powerful with a just bit more character development and insight historical information. Guess if you&#39;re completely familiar with the French Revolution and the stories of Danton and Robespierre in particular, this movie will be a perfect one for you to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s somewhat typical for a French movie to tell a story slowly and subtle, without ever stepping too much in detail. Often this works out charmingly but in this case the movie could had really done with a bit more depth. Other than that, this movie is still one fine example of French cinema, despite the fact that it&#39;s being directed by a Polish director and stars lots of Polish actors in it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gérard Depardieu is great in his role, though the movie also decides to concentrate a lot on many other different characters. The movie perhaps has a bit too many characters but each and every performance is a great one, so this doesn&#39;t really ever become a big complaint, other than that it slows done the story a bit at certain points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great movie that could had been brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10

Five teens set out to do some camping in the Oregon wilderness, and despite being warned by the park ranger, they soon realize that something is lurking around in the backwoods waiting to strike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to old horror movies, the only one that keeps popping up in every conversation is Friday THE 13th, so I took it upon myself to find those good old horror movies that fell short for simply being compared to Friday THE 13th, JUST BEFORE DAWN just so happened to be among the ones I found, and was really very impressive, it wasn&#39;t as bland as some of the stuff you find today, it was very sharp in terms of character development as it had quite a few likable ones, and it has this very casual pace, its not in a hurry to get to the hack and slash bits, it takes its time to set the proper mood and tone and is very atmospheric and builds some killer suspense by letting you always have that sense of dread like, somethings out there but you don&#39;t know where it is or when it will strike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I live its definitely an overlooked gem simply because people never heard of it or won&#39;t give it a chance, but I&#39;ll state that it is not a Friday THE 13th rip off, the two concepts don&#39;t even go near each other, but in my mind, it is overall one of the more impressive slashers I&#39;ve seen in a while.

After seeing the film version of Heart Of Darkness, I feel as if I wasted 100 minutes of my life. Though the book was not my favorite, I was very disappointed to see how poorly Nicolas Roeg portrayed the story. Despite the fact that he left out many bits of important information, the cast just did not seem to fit their roles and the whole film seemed vastly emotionless. The book depicts vivid scenery and detail that are completely disregarded in the movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;d think a director would be able to fit 76 pages of a book into a film of at least an hour and a half. The differences completely changed the story for me. For example, when the character of Kurtz&#39;s fiancée is nonchalant to the fact that Kurtz has died, it completely modifies the ending the book had given. Not to mention the sets and scenery used in the film were not nearly as beautiful as they were described. It sincerely feels as if Roeg was filming another story with references from Heart Of Darkness embedded in it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be anything like Joseph Conrad&#39;s tale, you may find it good. Though I thought the camera work was poor and the cast unfitting, it is a captivating story all the same. However, if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story, don&#39;t look for it in Roeg&#39;s film.

Well it&#39;s been a long year and I&#39;m down to reviewing the final film for 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of The River) placed second in the recent Metro Manila Film Festival. As expected, it didn&#39;t do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since MMFF is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in Filipino or English play out in the screen. I thought Cesar Montano did a good job both as a star and director. His great vision and creativity really helped this film. He was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film. Also performing well was young actress Rebecca Lusterio. She did a great job portraying Bikay, the younger sister of Duroy. I hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres. I think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the camera shots in the film were done very well. The scenery was made breathtaking even though I feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the story I feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film. I certainly won&#39;t be raving about the story of this film.

Ruthless evil warlord Samanosuke (superbly played to the hateful hilt by Yutaro Gomi) cruelly mistreats the peaceful residents of a small village. The giant stone statue Majin eventually comes to life to destroy Samanosuke and his wicked minions. Director Kimiyoshi Yasudo and screenwriter Tetsuro Yoshida give the compelling story all the power and simplicity of an ancient age-old legendary folktale: there&#39;s a very strong sense of an ancient time and faraway remote place (it&#39;s specifically set in feudal Japan), the good guys are noble and appealing while the villains are truly nasty and detestable, the occasional stirring swordfights are staged with considerable skill and gusto, the special effects are fine and impressive, the serious tone and steady pace never falter for a minute, and Majin&#39;s last reel rampage of savage destruction is extremely lively, exciting, and more than a little scary. Moreover, the fantastic elements of the narrative are given substantial credibility by being firmly grounded in a throughly believable dark, harsh and gritty world. This film earns bonus points for depicting Majin as more of a brutal and frightening force of angry vengeance instead of a pure spirit of absolute good. Veteran composer Akira Ifukube supplies a typically rich, robust and rousing score. Fujio Morita&#39;s sharp, moody cinematography likewise hits the bull&#39;s eye. The capable cast all give admirably sound and sincere performances, with especially praiseworthy work by Jun Fujimaki as the valiant, protective Kogenta and Tatsuo Endo as mean henchman Gunjuro. Highly recommended.

SPOILER WARNING: There are some minor spoilers in this review. Don&#39;t read it beyond the first paragraph if you plan on seeing the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Disney Channel currently has a policy to make loads of movies and show one a month on the cable channel. Most of these are mediocre and drab, having a few good elements but still being a disappointment (`Phantom of the Megaplex,&#39; `Stepsister From Planet Weird,&#39; `Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century&#39;). Every once in a great while, they make something really, really great (`Genius,&#39; `The Other Me&#39;). But once in a while The Disney Channel makes a huge mistake, and gives us a real stinker. This month (December 2000) The Disney Channel featured `The Ultimate Christmas Present,&#39; which I thought was terrible due to poor writing and worse acting. Apparently, `The Brainiacs.com&#39; was rushed out a few days before Christmas to get a jump on the holiday, because the plot has to do with toys. They even paid for a feature in the TV Guide, so I thought it must be better than the norm. I was in for a complete shock. Only Disney&#39;s `Model Behaviour&#39; has been worse than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot was more far-fetched than normal. I usually let that slide, but here it just goes too far. Matthew Tyler gets very sick of his widowed father spending most of his time at work. His father owns a small toy factory that has taken out large loans at a scrupulous bank to stay afloat. Time and time again, his father has to skip out on the plans he makes with his son and daughter. Matthew decides that the only way he can spend time with his dad is if he becomes the boss and orders him to stay home. He gets a hair-brained idea to create a website where kids all around the world can find and send him a dollar to invest in a computer chip that his sister is inventing. That whole concept is full of fallacies. When kids send in millions of dollars, Matthew opens his own company&#39;s bank account and buys up most of his dad&#39;s business&#39;s stock. He is the secret boss, but he doesn&#39;t reveal this to his dad, but instead presents himself at board meetings as a cartoon image through a computer. That image itself is so complex (and ridiculous) that it isn&#39;t possible for someone to create it at home, much less someone who comes across as stupid as Matthew. To make a long plot short, Matthew orders his dad to spend more time having fun and doing stuff with his kids, but a federal agent shows up inquiring about Matthew&#39;s company, as it is fraudulent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s so much wrong here. As mentioned, the stuff they do here is impossible even for true geniuses, which these kids are not. The website, the cartoon image, the computer chip, even the stuff they are being taught in school, are far too advanced for these kids. The acting by most of the cast, especially Kevin Kilner, is terrible. Some familiar faces are wasted. Dom DeLuise plays the evil bank owner, but his part is a throwaway. He has one good scene with Alexandra Paul (who shows she has the ability to act) in which he explains his motives, but nothing more. And Rich Little is wasted in a small role as a judge. There&#39;s even some offensive and uncalled for anti-Russian jokes. But the greatest atrocities are the hard-hammered themes. These themes show up in many of The Disney Channel&#39;s films, but never before have these ultra-conservative messages been pounded so strongly. The typical `overworking parent&#39; idea is really pushed hard, and after delivering it inappropriately in `The Ultimate Christmas Present,&#39; seeing it again sours my mood. Family relations are important, but Disney must stop this endless preaching, because working is important to maintaining a workable family, too. Except for cancelling activities thanks to work, the father didn&#39;t come across as that bad, but I found it offensive when the grandmother told him `I don&#39;t like what I see.&#39; Just as bad is the preaching of the idea that all single parents MUST marry if they want to raise their kids right. Enter Alexandra Paul, whose character, while important to the plot, is there solely to be the love interest for the father. This offensiveness only proves that the Disney brain trust lacks the brains to avoid scraping from the bottom of the Disney script barrel. Instead of letting this movie teach your kids how to commit serious fraud, wait for the next Disney Channel movie. It has to be better than this. Zantara&#39;s score: 1 out of 10.

I disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance. I can&#39;t imagine this as even approaching &#34;stoner classic.&#34; That would be like calling Singles a &#34;grunge film.&#34; The movie definitely plods along with a murky plot. At times I wondered if the script had either been dropped and shuffled or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it. Watching this movie reminded me of watching children play-acting and making the story up as they go along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are wooden, the dialog is taxed, and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected. Who got killed? When? What? And this is how you act when your friend overdoses? Complete lack of emotion and utter disconnect from reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the droning guitar soundtrack that accompanies each scene: enough! It was like watching the opening menu screen where the same track loops endlessly in the background, neither moving forward or back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept watching and hoping that the plot would somehow fall in to order, the acting and dialog would improve or something, somehow would focus this mess in to a coherent movie. After 112 minutes, it never happened.

Good drama movie about a child custody case with great performances by all the actors.A good example of what an excellent script can do to propel a simple story to a much higher quality.The screenplay was just average though and this is what kept the movie from the list of the all time best dramas.Still,the great acting makes this movie a good one to see if you are a fan of court dramas or a big fan of the lead actors.The movie really should have been a tad longer though for more excellence but that would really be nitpicking......

Detective Russell Logan(Lou Diamond Phillips)has a major problem on his hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing(Jeff Kober), for whom psychic extraordinaire Tess(Tracy Griffith)helped him capture, has been resurrected with The First Power(..given to him by Satan after his execution in the gas chamber)and can possess the bodies of the weak. Somehow, Russell, who joins forces with Tess(..who has an understanding of what they are up against), will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die at his bloody hands. They will seek help from Sister Marguerite(Elizabeth Arlen)who has tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic church of The First Power, but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop Channing..a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of Channing ridding the world of his evil. She&#39;ll take it anyway and lend a helping hand to Russell, who&#39;ll need all the help he can get when Channing kidnaps Tess preparing her for some sort of Satanic ritual/ceremony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the film, Mykelti Williamson, always a reliable welcome supporting actor, gets the partner of Russell role..so you know what will happen to him. As in films of this type, everyone around Russell is dying, but when he attempts to kill Channing, he&#39;s merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure occult rubbish..stupid from the gate to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith try, I&#39;ll give them that, but in a flick like this they don&#39;t stand a chance. Kober, who is normally often always effective as the heavy, is really handed nothing more than a goofy villain who leaps in the air and tosses rotten quips.

Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Heaven? Hell? A parallel universe? When the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; riding solo, the newest arrival, in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man, who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city, if the eyeballs work, is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited, if memory serves him right. Andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man estranged from people and objects, struggling to find his bearings; at home, or rather, his assigned apartment; or at work, where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard(Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him, &#34;You&#39;ll get used to it,&#34; which covers more than just crunching numbers, we suspect, in this world, same as the old world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If life is meaningless, like French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said for death, as well. The subculture of office life might be heaven for one man, but it looks like hell to us, under the context that &#34;Den Brysomme Mannen&#34; operates on. To work in the afterlife, in essence, is to work for the rest of your life. The social intercourse among Andreas&#39; office mates may pass as normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer, as he/she now recognizes the drudgery of white-collar labor performed by white-collar laborers, who kill the hours with their inconsequential small-talk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like automotons, each and every day, seem irrational in its self-evident absurdity. To see daily life replicated in a speculative light, &#34;Den Brysomme mannen&#34; makes normal human interaction look like deadpan comedy, as quotidian life becomes a performance, which transforms Karl Marx&#39;s meaning of the word &#34;alienation&#34;, because here, the men and women in the office, &#34;do&#34; identify with their labor, like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real. But the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade. He&#39;s always aware of the cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper, who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by, indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co-workers after he purposely cuts off his own finger, with the hope that he&#39;ll feel the pain, on a paper slicer. He doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s just another sensation, in addition to being able to taste and smell that&#39;s lost to the bothersome man. This inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures, amplifies the bothersome man&#39;s need for love,where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner party, hosted by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt(Petonella Barker). They hit it off. He walks her home. She invites him in. They become a couple. He moves in. When they have sex, however, it&#39;s good for neither Andreas, nor Anne, who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that&#39;s unattainable in this world, but love matters to the bothersome man, so he tries again with Ingeborg(Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. &#34;Den Brysomme mannen&#34; deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman. When Ingeborg doesn&#39;t elicit the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but odd city, with an open-endedness that&#39;s solvable, and offer up multiple interpretations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wounded by Ingeborg&#39;s apathy towards his avowal of love for her, the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station, stands at the same platform, leers at the same couple aggressively making out, and jumps. This time, he can&#39;t die. How can you die when you&#39;re already dead? Hit repeatedly by train after train, Andreas&#39; face turns into ground beef; his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art. When the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp, he seeks out the man from the club, who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead. Which is: death, not life, has no meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind Andreas&#39; whereabouts drives the narrative, and to the filmmaker&#39;s credit, this enigma is satisfactorily addressed, in a scene that recalls Spike Jonze&#39;s &#34;Being John Malkovich&#34;, when Andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to Malkovich&#39;s brain that Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl through. Andreas&#39; attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that &#34;heaven is a place on Earth&#34;. But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of a hell; the place that Andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination.

In 1954 Marlon Brando was THE hot actor after his performances in Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra had yet to re-invent himself on the silver screen. But Sinatra&#39;s portrayal as the erstwhile Nathan Detroit, helped re-establish Sinatra with his fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great screen version of a great play and the choices of leads and support players are terrific. Imagine a movie where Brando sings? This was his one and only singing role as he portrayed Sky Masterson. In addition the female leads, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine(replaying her stage role as Nathan&#39;s long suffering girlfriend Adelade), put in superlative efforts. Special mention goes to the great Stubby Kaye(as Nicely Nicely), and with all due respect to Eric Clapton, no one&#39;s version of Rockin&#39; The Boat even comes close to Stubby&#39;s. Sheldon Leonard, who would go on to fame as TV producer of such shows as The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show does &#34;Harry The Horse&#34; wonders, B.S.Pulley is excellent as the harsh mannered and rough talking &#34;Big Julie&#34;, and even Regis Toomey offers his excellence as &#34;Brother Arvide&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the fun musicals to see, good comedy, and you get Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo &#34;Luck Be A Lady Tonight&#34; and brother...&#34;it&#39;s your dice&#34;

Superb movie. Very good photography of 1969/70 Bolton, which seems now to be a different world. Thoughtful and an excellent dramatisation and production. James Mason a real first class star. It is and I would agree with the above comment that this movie is a national treasure.

STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuck-up career bitch Kate (Franka Potente) heads to the London underground to catch a train to take her to meet George Clooney. However, after a hectic working day, she dozes off and awakens to find herself alone in a deserted platform. As she races off on a situation taking her from one daunting encounter to the next, however, she learns of something far more malign and evil waiting for her out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a lot of ways, the British Film Industry is really becoming one on it&#39;s own, especially in the horror thriller department, with films such as Creep and the successful 28 Days Later (which this has strong echoes of in parts.) In terms of succeeding in what it set out to do, Creep does cleverly create (especially at the beginning) a scary sense of isolation and tense fear. At it&#39;s clever running time, it also (though inadvertently, I suspect) manages to pay homage to some of those pioneer high-concept horror films from the 70s that rely on shocks and fear through-out without really focusing too much on character development and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of it&#39;s weaknesses, some scenes are a little predictable, but these don&#39;t really succeed in making it less scary or effective in any way. I&#39;m not sure if the ending was meant to make it come off as some sort of morality play and it&#39;s not exactly perfect, but it&#39;s certainly very effective and serves it&#39;s basic function very well. ***

Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of maritime history. This is the story of a buccaneer Captain whose name for one short year struck terror in the hearts of seafarers and merchants from the ports of the Caribbean to the trading houses of London.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmm, that opening to the film sounds like we are in for one hell of a swashbuckling, pillaging, ripper of a movie doesn&#39;t it? Well it&#39;s not. Tho it&#39;s not totally without value as a curio piece. Out of 20th Century Fox, Anne Of The Indies is adapted by Philip Dunne &amp; Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass. Direction is by Jacques Tourneur, the score is by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson is providing the Technicolor photography. Jean Peters is in the titular title role of Anne {AKA Captain Providence} and support comes from Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez &amp; James Robertson Justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally meant to be be based on true life pirate Anne Bonny, the film ultimately turns out to be a tale of a woman seeking identity, and finding herself, in the predominantly male led world of piracy and sea based shenanigans. Filled with clichés and over familiar set pieces, the film also suffers from a cast that is largely misfiring. Peters gives it a right good go, and Paget lights up the screen with effervescent beauty. While Robertson Justice, although underused, actually looks the part and doesn&#39;t overact like the rest of the male cast does. Some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings, purely because it&#39;s Tourneur in the directing chair. But there is no depth here, this is merely a job for Tourneur, a professional one granted, but its thinly plotted and actually lacking swash to go with the buckle in the action stakes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disposable at best. 4/10

This movie is simply incredible! I had expected something quite different form the film that I actually saw. However, it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its linkage with animal behavior. Let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is all too sexual, for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a high-brow sort of pornography. It even features a scene that comes extremely close to rape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I strongly suggest seeing this rare work of &#34;sexual art&#34;. Every minute of the picture breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies, by the way. One should not forget how times have changed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go see it! It´s worth your money and time!

Quite a production from the director telling the story of The Qin Emperor&#39;s ambitious plan to unite all kingdoms of China. Some great characters, sets, costumes and scenes. However, I was not blown away by the film in terms of the actors ability (which was good I enjoyed the Marquis the most) or its look (although the massing of troops was extremely impressive, if it was real man that is a lot of extras!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen Li Gong in other movies and she is always great. Good period piece I think, but not one to judge the true historical accuracy of it. Good film and found the 2 1/2 + hours not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating 7 out of 10.

I caught this Cuban film at at an arthouse film club. It was shown shortly after the magisterial 1935 Silly Symphony cartoon where the Isle of Symphony is reconciled with the Isle of Jazz. What with the recently deceased Ruben Gonzalez piped through speakers in this old cinema-ballroom and a Cuban flag hanging from peeling stucco rocaille motifs, the scene was set for a riproaring celebration of engaged filmmaking and synchronised hissing at the idiocies of Helms-Burton. But then the film started. And the cinema&#39;s peeling paint gradually became more interesting than the shoddy mess on-screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storyline of Nada Mas promises much. Carla is a bored envelope-stamper at a Cuban post office. Her only escape from an altogether humdrum existence is to purloin letters and rewrite them, transforming basic interpersonal grunts into Brontëan outbursts of breathless emotion. Cue numerous shots of photogenic Cubans gushing with joy, grief, pity, terror and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the simplicity of the narrative is marred by endless excursions into film-school artiness, latino caricature, Marx brothers slapstick and even - during a particularly underwhelming editing trick - the celluloid scratching of a schoolkid defacement onto a character&#39;s face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unidimensional characters abound. Cunda, the boss at the post office, is a humourless dominatrix-nosferatu. Her boss-eyed accomplice, Concha, variously points fingers, eavesdrops and screeches. Cesar, the metalhead dolt and romantic interest, reveals hidden writing talent when Carla departs for Miami. A chase scene (in oh-so-hilarious fast-forward) is thrown in for good measure. All this would be fine in a Mortadello and Filemon comic strip, but in a black-and-white zero-FX flick with highbrow pretensions, ahem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nada Mas attempts to straddle the stile somewhere between the &#39;quirky-heroine-matchmakes-strangers&#39; of Amelie and the &#39;poetry-as-great-redeemer&#39; theme of Il Postino. Like Amelie, its protagonist is an eccentric single white female who combats impending spinsterdom by trying to bring magic into the lives of strangers. And like Il Postino, the film does not flinch from sustained recitals of poetry and a postman on a bicycle takes a romantic lead. Unfortunately, Nada Mas fails to capture the lushness and transcendence of either film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things that might merit watching this film in a late-night TV stupor. The first is the opening overhead shot of Carla on a checker-tiled floor, which cuts to the crossword puzzle she is working on. The second is to see Nada Mas as a cautionary example: our post Buena Vista Social Club obsession with Cuban artistic output can often blinker us into accepting any dross that features a bongo on the soundtrack. This film should not have merited a global release - films such as Waiting List and Guantanamera cover similar thematic territory far more successfully.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is bored with brother #1, and jumps in the bed of brother #2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no -- they are upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. Never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weakest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no -- he only wanted his sister? If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you to no end.

What a fun movie experience! I was expecting a sappy kids movie and found that I enjoyed it more than my teens. Take a tissue, it&#39;s not sad, just &#39;moving&#39; in parts. Finally, its a &#39;feel good&#39; flick for the whole family. Note: It&#39;s 2+ hours, so consider leaving the littlest &#39;squirmers&#39; home for this one. AP

This 1973 TV remake of the Billy Wilder classic is inferior to the original. Surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the good things. Lee J. Cobb makes a terrific Barton Keyes. He&#39;s not as good as Edward G. Robinson, of course, but he&#39;s the only reason to watch this. This remake&#39;s only improvement over the original is that it cuts down the role of Lola Dietrichson, the step-daughter of the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#39;s it for the good things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad things are many. The director records everything in an indifferent manner: if you watched the film with the sound muted you&#39;d hardly get the impression that anything especially interesting was happening. Because of modern bad taste, the film must be in color instead of black and white. Because of 1970s bad taste, all the sets are distractingly ugly. Walter Neff&#39;s expensive apartment, in particular, is hideous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The modern setting hurts in a lot of small ways. Train trips were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s, so Mr. Dietrichson&#39;s decision to take a train seems more of a contrivance. Men stopped wearing hats, which prevents Walter from covering up his brown hair while posing as the white-haired Mr. Dietrichson. Women in mourning stopped wearing veils, which robs Samantha Eggar of a prop Barbara Stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene. (Oddly, Lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she had need of them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Bochco keeps much of the Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler script the same. But he makes a lot of tiny, inexplicable changes to the dialogue which leave the script slightly flabby where once it was lean and muscular. Outrageously, the famous motorcycle-cop banter is gone, but look closely and you&#39;ll see what looks like a post-production cut where those lines should have been. Bochco may not be to blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Crenna is passable as Walter Neff. What might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead we get Samantha Eggar, who comes off like a standard-issue villainess from &#34;Barnaby Jones.&#34; But who can blame Eggar? With a director who barely seems interested in what&#39;s happening in front of the camera, how could Barbara Stanwyck herself have come off well?

This sci-fi adventure is not the best and by no means the worst. I agree with the statement that bad sci-fi is comical. Bizarre pink tinting and unusual special effects make this a favorite for the late, late, late show viewers. Space explorers on the planet Mars fight off strange giant amoeba-like monsters and other strange creatures. Pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast includes Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Get comfy and enjoy. Don&#39;t feel bad if you nod off for a moment. I agree with adding this to the list of cult classics to not miss.

I saw Heartland when it was first released in 1980 and I have just seen it again. It improves with age. Heartland is not just for lovers of &#34;indie&#34; films. At a time when most American films are little more than cynical attempts to make money with CGI, pyrotechnics, and/or vulgarity, Heartland holds up as a slice of American history. It is also a reminder of how spoiled most of us modern, urbanized Americans are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing in this film is overstated or stagey. No one declaims any Hollywood movie speeches. The actors really inhabit their roles. This really feels like a &#34;small&#34; film but really it is bigger than most multizillion-dollar Hollywood productions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is based on the lives of real people. In 1910, Elinore Randall (Conchata Ferrell, who has never done anything better than this), a widow with a 7-year-old daughter Jerrine (Megan Folsom), is living in Denver but wants more opportunities. She advertises for a position as housekeeper. The ad is answered by Clyde Stewart (Rip Torn, one of our most under-appreciated actors), a Scots-born rancher, himself a widower, with a homestead outside of Burnt Fork, Wyoming. Elinore accepts the position (seven dollars a week!) and moves up to Wyoming with her daughter. She and her daughter move into Stewart&#39;s tiny house on the property. It is rolling, treeless rangeland, a place of endless vistas where the silence is broken only by the sounds made by these people and their animals. It&#39;s guaranteed to make a person feel small. The three characters go for long periods without seeing another human soul. What is worse, Stewart turns out to be taciturn to the point of being almost silent. &#34;I can&#39;t talk to the man,&#34; Elinore complains to Grandma Landauer. &#34;You&#39;d better learn before winter,&#34; replies Grandma. Grandma (Lilia Skala) is one of the only two other characters who are seen more than fleetingly. She came out to Wyoming from Germany with her husband many years before and runs her ranch alone now that she is also widowed. Grandma is their nearest neighbor (and the local midwife) and still she lives ten miles away! The other supporting character is Jack the hired hand (Barry Primus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elinore&#39;s routine (and her employer&#39;s) is one of endless, backbreaking labor, where there are no modern conveniences and where everything must be made, fixed or done by hand. This is the real meat of the film: Watching the ordinary life of these ranchers as they struggle against nature to wrest a living from the land. But despite the constant toil and fatigue, Elinore is always looking for other opportunities. She learns that the tract adjacent to Stewart&#39;s is unclaimed. Impulsively, she files a claim on the property (twelve dollars, or almost two weeks&#39; pay!), meaning that if she lives on it (and she must actually live there) and works it for ten years, she will get the deed to it. Naturally, Stewart learns what she has done. With merciless logic, he points out that with no money, no livestock, no credit, and no assets, she has no chance of succeeding. He then offers a solution: He proposes marriage. The stunned Elinore realizes that this is the only real alternative, and accepts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We think that Stewart&#39;s proposal is purely Machiavellian---he wants the land and the free labor---but we see that, in fact, he is genuinely fond of Elinore, and they grow together as a couple. She becomes pregnant; she goes into labor in the middle of a midwinter blizzard; Clyde travels for hours on horseback through the storm the ten miles to Grandma&#39;s and the ten miles back, only to announce that Grandma wasn&#39;t there. This is more like real life than is pleasant, folks. Elinore has the baby all by herself, with no help whatsoever. Their son is still an infant when he gets sick and dies. They lose half their livestock to the vicious winter. They struggle on. The last sequence in the film is supposed to be optimistic: The birth of a calf. Clyde calls Elinore urgently to help him deliver the calf. Instead of being head first, the calf is in a footling breech presentation. He and Elinore must physically pull the calf out of the birth canal. There is no CGI, animatronics, trickery, fakery or special effects: What you see is what happened, folks: A calf is born on a bed of straw in a wooden barn by lamplight. With that, the film does not so much end as simply stop, leaving the viewer unsatisfied, but after a while you appreciate the film as a whole, not just for its ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little gem rewards patience and thoughtfulness. It will be watchable long after most of the films of the last generation have long been forgotten.

&#34;A young man, recently engaged to be married, is the victim of a traffic accident and dies as a result of his injuries. His father, desperate to revive his son, agrees to let a scientist friend try his experimental soul transmigration process to save him. After the young man returns to life, the father and fiancée notice a dark and violent change in the young man&#39;s behavior, leading them to believe something went horribly wrong in the revival process,&#34; according to the DVD sleeve&#39;s synopsis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point, Edward Norris (as Philip Bennett) is asked, &#34;What do you think this is, Boys Town?&#34; Mr. Norris should know, since he was in &#34;Boys Town&#34;. &#34;The Man with Two Lives &#34; is more like &#34;Black Friday&#34; minus Karloff and Lugosi. You do the math. This film might have been a contender, with a re-worked script; it does feature an intriguing final act. After a tepid &#34;shoot out&#34;, hang in for the drama to pick up with a well-played scene between star Norris and pursuing detective Addison Richards (as George Bradley).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** The Man with Two Lives (1942) Phil Rosen ~ Edward Norris, Eleanor Lawson, Addison Richards

Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel. It&#39;s too easy. So I&#39;m going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of Little Man. First, I&#39;m impressed with the special effects. It really did look like Marlon Wayans&#39; head was attached to the body of a little person. I never doubted it for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I loved some of the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer, and his renditions of &#34;Havin&#39; My Baby&#34; and &#34;Movin&#39; On Up&#34; were priceless. John Witherspoon, who, coincidentally, played Grier&#39;s father in 1992&#39;s Boomerang (if you remember, he &#34;coordinated&#34; the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa&#39;s father in Little Man. So that was fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, this movie is about as believable as White Chicks. How dumb is it when even the doctor can&#39;t tell that it&#39;s a 40-year-old man and not a baby? He&#39;s got a full set of teeth!!! How is it possible that no one seems to notice that it&#39;s not a baby? Little Man is so bad that there&#39;s a Rob Schneider cameo. And please, if you&#39;re stupid enough to waste $8 on this movie, at least do me a favor and DO NOT bring your children. This movie is way too sexual for small children (lots of jokes and innuendo about sex, going down, eating out, etc.), and I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening I was forced to endure. If you insist on seeing an idiotic film, as least spare your children the pain and suffering.

Surface was awesome, I don&#39;t know how many Mondays I survived at school just by thinking about the new episode of surface. I loved it, sometimes I had to call home and tell my mom to tape it for me. I was pretty upset when I heard it was cancelled, I mean jeez way to let us hang. So,they can have their new Tina fay comedy(you couldn&#39;t pay me to watch that, I think seeing the commercials made me dumber). I&#39;m gonna miss my Monday night fix of Surface, even if my sister did make fun of me. although,kidnapped does look good and, they still have L&amp;O: SVU (i think, i still have to check) (i only wrote the 2 lines above, because they said i needed ten lines).

The first season told pretty much how all elements of the Marine Corps would operate (i.e. ground, air, helicopters and jets) as a team. That&#39;s the season I give the high rating to! (True, there are still a lot of &#34;liberties&#34; taken in season 1, but the stories were more believable.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subsequent seasons were a gawd-awful attempt of Melrose Place meets Top Gun! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a Marine stationed at Miramar at the time and I remember them shooting the show around the San Diego area. I got to talk to Rod Rowland and James Brolin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rowland&#39;s character was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brolin&#39;s character was good in the first season only. For some reason he slacked off after the first ep of the second season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see a LITTLE of how the Marine Air Ground team operates, then season one is the one to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re into Melrose Place and soap opera like plots with an attempt to merge them into Top Gun, then see the last two seasons.

Wicked Little Things (known in Australia as &#34;Zombies&#34;) is a rare find  a film that promises one thing but delivers another. It is one of the few genre films to be made by Millennium Pictures, a European film studio known for making various B-grade action films &amp; thrillers, some featuring action star Jean-Claude Van Damme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen Tunny &amp; her two daughters Sarah &amp; Emma arrive in the Pennsylvanian town of Addytown in order to move into a large house that Karen&#39;s late husband owned after finding a miner&#39;s deed in his effects. Once arriving, they find that the house is very old &amp; in need of repair. But the house&#39;s condition is the least of their problems, as they discover that the area is prone to disappearances &amp; Karen is confronted by the area&#39;s owner &amp; ordered to move out. Once night falls, the Tunnys find out the reason behind the vanishings: a group of zombie children, killed in a mine collapse in the area more than 85 years ago, come out to kill anything that goes in the woods. With the help of a grizzled neighbour, Karen attempts to end the curse before her &amp; her children become the next victims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the DVD expecting a film with flesh-eating zombies, but was let down by one thing: the film is more akin to a ghost story than your usual zombie flick, with the dead children being the embodiment of a curse that haunts the woods, taking their revenge on anything that moves around at night (although the internal logic is somewhat flawed  the children can only be appeased by the sacrifice of animals &amp; are repelled by blood wards on doors in the same manner that vampires are repelled by garlic &amp; mirrors  aren&#39;t these kids supposed to be zombies?). The plot as such would not be a problem &amp; would actually be entertaining, but the main problem is that the producers adapted a script with the intention of making a zombie film, only to fall flat on their faces with this effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, a film like this would be okay as a ghost story but, due to a poor script, becomes nothing more than an entirely routine effort. The film&#39;s greatest strength is the acting, with the cast giving better performances than the film deserves. Of particular note is Scout Taylor-Compton, who does her role quite well  it&#39;s a shame she ruins her genre cred with a very poor performance in the HALLOWEEN remake (or maybe it&#39;s just Rob Zombie&#39;s script).

It was an interesting and entertaining movie well worth watching. The acting was decent but it may be out of date for some people. I was glad to see cast members of such highly acclaimed movies as &#34;Raging Bull&#34; and &#34;Goodfellas&#34; in this movie A great and dramatic ending and pretty good writing.

The only thing I knew about this film prior to seeing it was Robby The Robot. My preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci-fi flicks that the 1950&#39;s was noted for. How wrong I was. Big studio, big budget and big production values make this a strong contender, at least visually, for the best sci-fi film coming out of the era. I qualify with the word visually, because &#34;War Of The Worlds&#34; is a lot darker and scarier than &#34;Forbidden Planet&#34;, and probably fits the mold better as a foray into alien territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography, followed by the intricacy and scope of detail involved in Dr. Morbius&#39; (Walter Pidgeon) home and laboratory. But that was only the prelude to the icing on the cake, the labyrinthine underground that served as the Krell stronghold. It appeared that Krell technology was even more advanced than say, that of &#34;Star Wars&#34;. Which made me consider, audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in 1977 with SW, or in 1986 with &#34;Aliens&#34;. Watching it on a large screen TV in my living room offered me the same effect, and I&#39;m fairly resistant to hyperbole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not too much of a stretch to imagine &#34;Forbidden Planet&#34; as a direct antecedent of the &#39;Star Trek&#39; TV series; Gene Roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show. Followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in &#39;Star Trek&#39;. I had to do a double take when the men of United Planets Cruiser C57-V headed for a transporter room, while the conundrum presented to Robby that created an impossibility to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the ST series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of &#39;monsters from the Id&#39;. That Morbius himself was using his subconscious mind to defend Altaire IV was certainly a unique concept for 1956, when every other sci-fi flick of the time was dealing with Martians or other grotesque space creatures. The film worked it&#39;s subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that Morbius was the protector of Altaire IV some time before Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen) explained it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, looking at the calendar, the year 2200 isn&#39;t that far off. This movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets. I think though, that they&#39;ll have to come up with a sleeker looking version of Robby.

There&#39;s about 25 years worth of inspiration packed into it. Beginning with existential themes of Blade Runner, as well as the vision of the future - with corporate billboards advertising their products, to the technology of the later Matrix films and Spielberg&#39;s A.I., and finally the black and white graphic novel look similar in style of Sin City. The creators have put in a lot of effort in the visual department and the outcome is a well crafted future neo-noir. Add a detective story and you&#39;ve got an interesting film. I know what it wanted to be, but regardless of the stunning visuals, it wasn&#39;t enough to get it to the final destination.

So &#39;Thinner&#39;... Yep.. This Steven Bachman (read Steven King) yarn about a man who gets his just desserts from a Gypsy Elder who he just killed, The story itself is there, no doubt about it, but I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t enjoy it more than I could have. I guess what really distracted me was the actors. I mean, who&#39;s the lead? Robert John Burke? Who&#39;s he? And fer crying out loud, can someone please stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for every Italian Mafioso role there ever is? And while we&#39;re at it, does every Mafioso have to have a pasta cooking Italian mother? The only good acting job done here is under 10 pounds of makeup, Michael Constantine as the Gypsy elder. He&#39;s pretty good. But the rest, I make you all, &#34;better actors...&#34;

I am so impressed, really. I expected cheesy gamer humor and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, there&#39;s a ton of pretty geeky humor. But the movie is so well done. The acting is quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialog, while gamer cheesy at times, I guess to cater to the gamer crowd, is not bad at all. At times it&#39;s even, dare I say, great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the female gamer, who built this non traditional fighter type character rather then the usual (min/max) type gets all these additional attacks (seem right, I did not check the rules,) it was cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sets are amazing for what must be a fairly low production movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story moves right along. The transitions from game world to real world are well done. A male playing a female character would sometimes be played by a female, and sometimes by himself. Pretty clever, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guy who decided to play a female, but kept forgetting he was female was good for a lot of laughs. He even said tag at one point, and the female walked on to play the role ( sorry, I did not look her name up, she did great though.) The guy always trying to &#34;get some&#34;, got a bit tedious, but I guess that was more gamer humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was just so much to like about the movie. Lighthearted. Fun! Very well done and I am saying that as a movie fan, not a gamer (and I am not a D&amp;D player.) As I said I expected SO much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movies often don&#39;t hold my attention, I end up listening to them while working on my computer. This one held my attention. I can&#39;t give a movie much higher praise.

I have never commented on IMDb before, but I feel I have to after watching The Batman animation. Its absolute rubbish! Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early 90s so what the hell are they doing trying to mess with the winning formula? I feel like writing a complaint letter to WB. The original animation was dark and brooding, exactly the way Batman was intended to be. WB had to mess this up with some tripe Batman of the Future. Now they produce this drivel. The Joker doesn&#39;t remotely resemble the Joker from DC comics. DC should sue. I urge everyone who agrees with me to email or write to WB and use people power to get back the original formula

Was excited at the opening to hear part of &#34;Chevaliers De Sangreal&#34; but wanted more so I bought said Hans Zimmer piece. Possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written! This movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w/o the religious considerations. You get to tour the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography. The opening at CERN where the &#34;God Particle&#34; or largest quantity of Antimatter is created with STUNNING visuals is an immediate clue which foretells the excellence of this movie. Who doesn&#39;t love Hanks? The storyline and twists in this film are just superb and well drawn out until the amazingly twisted climax. This film suggests a satisfying compromise between Science and Religion though plenty of closed heads will persist on both sides. &#34;Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.&#34; A.Einstein

I have no qualms with how the movie does NOT capture New Jersey (like Zach, I&#39;m from there). Fine. Whatever. I lived there WAY long enough. I don&#39;t need to see a movie that captures the Garden State.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do have qualms with is how bad this movie is. Let&#39;s make it easy on you. We&#39;ll use some bullet-points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you wouldn&#39;t be able to predict the movie ANYWAY): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The music placement was maddeningly forced and patronizing. Example: Large: &#34;What are you listening to?&#34; Sam: &#34;The Shins. Ever heard of &#39;em?&#34; &#34;No.&#34; &#34;Listen to this song - it will change your life!&#34; And then they proceed to play that Shins song that was in a McDonalds commercial. (Don&#39;t you love when the characters in a movie blatantly tell you - the viewer - how to react to something? I love that! Hey, they should have put subtitles during various scenes instructing us to &#34;chuckle,&#34; &#34;Say &#39;aaaaaw&#39;&#34; &#34;cry&#34; &#34;feel inspired&#34; etc.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The scenes were SO BAD. SO Cliché. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example: The entire movie. But no, really, example: They&#39;re in the rainy quarry by the ark. Large runs up - in the pouring rain (oh he&#39;s SO TORMENTED!) - on top of a piece of heavy machinery and SCREAMS! Oh how moving! But wait! Here comes Sam and his buddy (the annoying drug addict), and they ALL SCREAM!!!! BUT WAIT!!!! OH MY GOD!!!! Here it comes! THEY KISS!!! LONG, DEEP!!!! IN THE RAIN!!!!!!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The dialogue was SO BAD. SO Cliché. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example. They&#39;re leaving the ark and Sam says something like, &#34;Hey. Good luck exploring the infinite abyss.&#34; And the guy says back, &#34;You, too.&#34; Oh...Oh my! I never realized...could it be? Oh my God it is! Large&#39;s life is like...ohmigod...AN INFINITE ABYSS!!!! Another example: Large and Sam in the airport. Sam says something like, &#34;Is this goodbye?&#34; Not enough for ya? OK, Largeman says something like, &#34;This isn&#39;t a period at the end of the sentence... it&#39;s an ellipses.&#34; And guess what happens when he tries to walk down the jetway and go back to his life in LA. You know, what? Don&#39;t guess. It&#39;s a waste of your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#39;s a Grade Z Wes Anderson rip-off movie. When not busy being melodramatic and cliché, the movie spends lots of times with crazy-kooky-off-kilter characters. Hey, Sam&#39;s brother... thank you Zach Braff for including him, because it really made the movie so much more textured. Also ripping off Anderson: the dialogue. Scene: Sam and Largeman are in a bar. In walks friends, &#34;Vagina!&#34; says one of them. Then they see him sitting with Sam, so one of the friends says, &#34;Sorry I said vagina.&#34; And Sam says, &#34;It&#39;s OK.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Inventive cinematography that&#39;s not inventive but pointless and annoying. Give me a break with the speed-up/slow down of film. Again, Wes Anderson does it effectively in his movies. And it was done well in &#34;Donnie Darko.&#34; But, really, it was pointless. Wow. A crazy party where people are taking X and snorting coke. Better roll out all the tricks! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-You can count the good moments on one hand (even if you&#39;re missing fingers). That&#39;s what makes it even WORSE. The retarded quarterback thing...well, that was good! The little thing he (largeman) says as they&#39;re about to enter the quarry (something about huffing turpentine)...that was good! Oh, wait, that&#39;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, Zach Braff is, I think, always a little too cute. But, he&#39;s likable. But, man, this is forced, pretentious, melodramatic (have you gotten that yet?), overly cute, overly everything. This movie is terrible. Apparently, I&#39;m outnumbered, as this waste of time is currently rated an 8.0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, though, if you&#39;re looking for something truly poignant and subtle and unique DO. NOT. RENT. THIS. MOVIE.

Three zany couples, all SIX OF A KIND, become entangled in a madcap search for stolen bank loot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lively, hilarious comedy, with the six stars - Charlie Ruggles &amp; Mary Boland, W. C. Fields &amp; Alison Skipworth, George Burns &amp; Gracie Allen - all heartily engaged in doing what they did best: getting laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruggles &amp; Boland make another of their film appearances as husband &amp; wife - this time rather more amorous than usual. They were a perfect team - she the strident lioness, he the nervous rabbit - and they dominate most of the screen time here. From beginning to end, they are a delight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burns &amp; Allen continue the patter they originated in Vaudeville, perfected on radio &amp; would eventually take to television, with George the perpetual straight man &amp; Gracie the eternal fool. At times in the film she tends to go a bit over the top, but it&#39;s difficult to dislike her. Her heart was obviously made of solid gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Skipworth is given rather short shrift - only fragments of her formidable personality flash through - Fields is in his element as the disreputable sheriff of Nuggetville, Nevada. Whether explaining how he got the nickname Honest John&#39; or skulking about at night looking for the missing moola, he is never less than wonderful. Best of all, he gets to perform his entire classic pool routine, preserving it forever for a grateful posterity. Finally, he executes the near miraculous - he gets Gracie to shut up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paramount was so pleased with the success of SIX OF A KIND that they wanted to hurry the principle players into another comedy. Only Fields demurred. He felt he had now arrived at the point where he no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comics. The Studio finally agreed and began preparation of Fields&#39; first solo starring feature, YOU&#39;RE TELLING ME (1934).

Think of an extremely low-rent version of &#34;Heathers,&#34; and you&#39;ve got &#34;Pep Squad.&#34; That sums up the flick in a nutshell. I must give credit where credit&#39;s due, though. The film has a nice visual appeal to it. I liked the cinematography, I liked the wild color schemes, I liked the costume designs. But without good acting, a film has no redeeming value. I&#39;d rather watch a film with little visual appeal, with good actors and sharp dialogue (i.e.: &#34;The Brothers McMullen&#34; or any Edward Burns film). The actors either recite their dialogue in monotones or scream it out like they&#39;re in a bad soap opera. This is why I don&#39;t badmouth most mainstream actors. Let&#39;s face it, most actors who are mainstream are mainstream for a reason. If they&#39;re not &#34;great&#34; actors, they&#39;re at least competent. People badmouth Leo DiCaprio, but when was the last time you saw a movie where he recites the dialogue as if he&#39;s reading it off the page? It&#39;s a shame, because the director seems like he knows his stuff when it comes to mis en scene (sp). At the same time I can&#39;t totally praise Steve Balderson (the director). He did write the screenplay, which contains some horrible dialogue. He might be slightly racist too, since there&#39;s a black principal in the movie, who inhabits a culmination of African-American stereotypes.

I saw the film yesterday and stopped it at half time because I felt it was a waste of time. The idea to make a film through the eyes of a headsman - one of the &#34;evil guys&#34; throughout most fantasy and medieval films - is great and offers plenty of possibilities but... the film couldn&#39;t catch one of them. I was not feeling for any of the characters, the plot was all too predictable (to the point that I followed it)and the second leap of time in the storyline made me quit. Those who expect a deep insight into the emotional situation of a headsman in the middle Ages, a social outcast to that time, might be disappointed.

I&#39;m not picky with movies, oh I&#39;ve seen so much crap I could watch anything. Maybe that was the reason I watched this one to the end. Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is. The security-camera footage of a game-play would make it feel more realistic than this movie does. The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong. In some scenes you can see that it was filmed in some photo when !!!!!(spoilers ahead)!!!!!people running around does not disturb people sitting near computers. I mean would you continue your work if you got ninjas around you? oh and the jokes about pirates, that&#39;s the worst one yet in movies!!!!!(spoilers end)!!!!! At least first one felt like a documentary, now it looks like someones home video experiment. You can find better movies at youtube. Top line: Don&#39;t waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.

Ok let&#39;s start with saying that when a dutch movie is bad, it&#39;s REALLY BAD. Rarely something with a little bit of quality comes along(Lek, Karakter) here in holland but not often. Costa! is about 4 girls going to Spain to go on vacation, party, get drunk, get laid (u know the drill). It&#39;s also about the world of Clubbers or Proppers. Pro&#39;s who&#39;re trying to lure the crowd into their club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not sure how long it took to write the script, but i suspect somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you&#39;re watching a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes long. Nothing, and i mean nothing is believable in this movie. It&#39;s almost too riduculous for words what happens with the storyline. Suddenly the movie transforms into a sort of karate action thing. With a one-on-one fight with &#39;the bad guy in black&#39; and cliche car chase scenes trough a watertank-car (can it be more cheesy). Also the words character-development and casting are unfamiliar to the makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having seen &#34;Traffic&#34; 3 days before this, i fell from sheer brilliance, from a piece of art to this. This is film-making at it&#39;s saddest. And don&#39;t start about low budget. Because even with a low budget you could write a better script. It almost seems that the film-makers were too busy partying themselves to make a decent movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway the chicks in the water at the end made it up a little bit, but for the rest of it, don&#39;t waste your money on such garbage.

The producer, Matt Mochary, stumbled upon the film&#39;s subject, Anderson Sa (leader of the AfroReggae music movement), when on a Hewlett Foundation trip to Rio de Janeiro. Mochary was so moved by Sa&#39;s story that he called his friend, NYC filmmaker Jim Zimbalist, who quit his job and joined Mochary in Brazil to work on a documentary on Sa, Rio&#39;s favelas, and the culture of violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first part of the film shows you the culture of violence in Rio&#39;s favelas (shantytowns where the poor live) via footage of police raids and assaults on the residents. The footage is graphic and shocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rising from the negativity of the favelas is the charismatic Anderson Sa, who overcame a possible career in drug dealing to start the AfroReggae movement, which combines elements of Afro-Brazilian culture, Reggae, ska, and other elements into a fast-paced, percussion heavy style of music which has since spread to other parts of the world. You can&#39;t help but be carried away by the music, especially when you see the local children get involved in Sa&#39;s school, which he founded to keep kids out of drug gangs. The rest of the film follows Sa&#39;s meteoric rise and his positivity changes many of the children&#39;s lives to seek a life beyond drug running. SPOILER: Just when the filmmakers thought they had wrapped filming, an unbelievable life changing event occurs of which the resolution has to be seen to be believed. The film then continues and you are gripped in your seat until the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is a response to &#34;City of God,&#34; and a worthy one at that. The bleak situation portrayed in that movie is countered by a real example of how favela dwellers can overcome the dire situation they are in and use their resources to constructive ends. You can&#39;t help not liking and rooting for Anderson Sa to succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is terrifically shot, fast-paced, and is quite absorbing. Judging by the overwhelming response of the audience at last night&#39;s SilverDocs screening, the film should get domestic distribution in the US and the thumping soundtrack should be released as well. Keep an eye for this superlative documentary--it is excellent!

This film was a disaster from start to finish. Interspersed with performances from &#34;the next generation of beautiful losers&#34; are interviews with Bono and The Edge as well as the performers themselves. This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself, who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence, wisdom and humor. The rest are too busy trying to canonize him as St. Leonard or as some Old Testament prophet. Many of the performances are forgettable over-interpretations (especially Rufus &amp; Martha Wainright&#39;s) or bland under-achievements. Only Beth Orton and Anthony got within striking distance of Leonard&#39;s own versions by using a little restraint. Annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film- like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots, shaky blurred camera work, use of digital delay on some of Leonard Cohen&#39;s comments (making it harder to hear what&#39;s being said) and a spooky, pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments (an attempt at added gravitas?). For the real thing, see the Songs From The Life Of documentary produced by the BBC in 1988.

There aren&#39;t enough gay-themed movies and there aren&#39;t enough `coming out&#39; movies. Every one is a welcome addition to the genre. Although the production values are high(the movie `looks&#39; good, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks REAL good in a pair of jeans) this is a bad one. It is a period piece: gay life under an oppressive regime(East Berlin, 1989) a life that seems 40 years behind the west. In a way we&#39;re seeing our own history; what it might have been like for gays in the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s here(it often reminded me of `Last Exit to Brooklyn :the book not the film).But it is unremittingly depressing and SLOW in a contrived way that evoked an old SCTV send up of Ingmar Bergman. It is so sloppily edited I wonder if the director just didn&#39;t hack at random. Yes, it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before The Wall came down and yes, life behind the `Curtain&#39; was hard for gay people. A good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience. A good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great coming-out movies and not one of the misses.

It might be a stretch saying this as a die-hard Carlin fan, but the material, both written and as performed, in It&#39;s Bad for Ya is some of the best late-era material yet. At 70 Carlin bounces back from the level of despair (and some of the stumbles in the act itself) from Life is Worth Losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful- or as much as the &#34;old f***&#34; can get- and is continuously, ceaselessly, funny. And funny as in reminiscent of what some of us had going on when watching Back in Town or &#39;Diseased&#39; the first time. The material, even if sounding at times a tinge of the previously done (i.e. the whole bit on children in school and camp like the Children segment in Diseased), is always fresh and with such a sting of truth to everything that it scalds the mind while (here goes) tickling the funny bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going from the topic of death (how long to wait to scratch off a name from the book? six weeks, unless if on the computer scheduler), the facets of communication, looking down from Heaven, spots of God (naturally), kids, and just troublesome gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have &#34;Rights&#34; make up the bulk of the special, centered around the premise that what&#39;s bad for you, plain and simple, is BS. Total, complete BS, which as we also learn (or if you&#39;ve really learned it you&#39;re like the kid waiting at the street corner for a week following dropped off not-quite randomly by the parent) holds the country together. Carlin isn&#39;t necessarily angry though, even if disdain seems to spout out at most turns, even just to observe how horrifying children&#39;s teeth coming in look. It&#39;s skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is NOT going to be &#34;fine&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it comes down to is this: Carlin is to dirty, witty, cautionary stand-up comedy what Yoda is to Jedis everywhere, which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where it&#39;s pretty damn hard to get any. At the least, we get classic GC - outrageous lines and bits from the man&#39;s 13th (or is it 14th) comedy special, including as far as an eyebrow-raising observation on people who play Mozart music during a birth!

This film, though ostensibly a comedy, is deadly serious. Its subject is Imperialism (with a capital I): how Britain, foolishly, humiliatingly, tries to convince itself that it&#39;s still a great power after World War II. At home, the Empire is run by amiable dolts, benevolent Tories who are so in-bred that they can&#39;t distinguish close relatives; the Offices of Government consist of long forgotten archives (a dig at Orwellian paranoia?), inhabited by indolent rats, and ante-rooms wherein lounge bored synacures, reading popular novels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abroad, Britain clings to the old pomp; but pomp out of context looks threadbare and silly, especially when its embodied in bumbling twits. Carlton-Browne is an unsentimental picture of decline, with none of the lachrymose rot that marred the supposedly anti-imperialist Jewel in the Crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is also about the Cold War, bravely admitting that it&#39;s a dangerous farce, whose participants deserve mockery and contempt, not fear and respect. It&#39;s about how colonialism, characterised more by neglect than tyranny, destroys the colonies it deserts, robbing them of amenities, power, and, most importantly, self-respect, leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s the seriousness, of course, that kills it. That&#39;s not to say that weighty subjects can&#39;t be treated in comedy - The Miracle Of Morgan&#39;s Creek, Dr. Strangelove and The Life Of Brian have all proved that. Indeed, one might suggest that serious themes should only be treated by comedy - it allows for a clearer-eyed view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with Carlton-Browne is that every situation must have a significance beyond the merely comic, so that it becomes weighed down and unfunny. In the three films mentioned above, much of the comedy arises from character reaction to an extreme situation, not the extreme situation itself. Here, the script is too poor to sustain rich comic characterisations, and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled - Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John le Mesurier - are criminally wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry-Thomas, sublime so often, shows that he couldn&#39;t handle lead parts, and that he needed to play sneering, arrogant bounders, not brainless toffs. The music is made to carry much of the comedy, but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on screen. (To be fair, unlike the majority of British comedies of the period, which were stagy and underproduced, the Boultings often try to make their points through film itself, by montage and composition) Only Huntley manages to raise genuine laughs, and that&#39;s by essaying a character he could have played in his sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the Boultings&#39; farces have dated well - they&#39;re never thought through enough. Although Carlton-Browne revels in the decline of the Empire, it also seems to be anti-democratic and militaristic. I&#39;m sure this wasn&#39;t intended, but these blunders are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form.

i have one word: focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMDb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. okay. let&#39;s discuss the fine points of focus. i don&#39;t know about the rest of you, but in my first year of film school they taught us a lot of useless crap, like &#39;you&#39;ll all be famous avant-garde filmmakers someday&#39;--but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing called FOCUSING the lens! it was amazing! you give a little twist and wham! everything is clear as a bell. the person who shot what alice found needs to learn a few things about the finer points of focus. lighting, too. this movie is not only completely out of focus, it&#39;s also lit like the corner of someone&#39;s basement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#39;t even get me started on pacing or plot. they could have trimmed about ten seconds off the beginning and end of every single shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but who cares about that anyhow? there is not enough lurid in this movie to make up for the utter lack of regard to film&#39;s best friends--FOCUS, and LIGHTING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;words to the wise.

This movie is a lot of fun. What makes it great especially are two things: one is the straightforward way the characters embrace the stereotypes, with discussions of their costumes and superpowers. There&#39;s an endearing earnestness to the parody that&#39;s very appealing; the second is basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves particular note as the object of Mr. Furious&#39;s desires. There&#39;s a boatload of talent here. I realize some with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this movie is a lot of fun, and kind of sweet.

it was very sensitive very deep. It&#39;s my favorite all the time you can&#39;t see movie more deeper than this incredible movie. susan sarandon made her role as matured mind actress, and she realized her role. She deserved the award. She convinced me with for being a nun. The music was very impressive and sensitive. Really i liked this deep masterpiece.

Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a &#34;family saga&#34; rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion. In this film he was portrayed as being &#34;Jesus&#34; like in his refusal to go to war with the Hittites even through they were invading Egypt and in his closing speech about the futility of materiality and political power. Initially one makes a connection between Sinuhe, who was cast adrift in the river Nile in a reed basket, and the Old Testament Moses. But this connection is not carried no doubt this will be fully explored in a new film wherein a Moses like character carries Akhenaton&#39;s monotheistic religion out to the wider world, if such a film will ever be politically possible to make. It is universally accepted that were women are concerned we man are stupid creatures but the relationship or lack of one between Sinuhe and Merit, the character played by Jean Simmons is hard to accept. And that Sinuhe, an educated physician, would be so smitten by Nefer the Babylonian &#34;femme fatal&#34; to the extent of giving her his adopted parents house and Tomb is not really believable, neither that his parents would even have a tomb. In real life Nefer (Nefertitti) was the wife of Akhenaton. And although Horemheb did become Pharaoh it was after a few others including Tutankhamen , who was the son of Akhenaton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But of course this is just nit picking and the film is enjoyable to watch and that it is about Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus. Maybe following &#34;The De Vinci Code&#34; book and film this film be re-made with the central secret being the foundation of our current monotheism! I wait in great anticipation of such a film, there are already numerous books on the subject.

The oddly-named Vera-Ellen was to movie dancing what Sonja Henie was to movie ice-skating: blonde, girlish, always delightful to watch, but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material. When I watch Vera-Ellen&#39;s sexy apache dance with Gene Kelly in &#39;Words and Music&#39;, I can&#39;t help noticing that her blouse (yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes) seems to be made out of the South Vietnam flag. For some reason, the very American Vera-Ellen starred in *two* musicals (made several years apart) set in Edinburgh, a city not noted for its tap-dancers: &#39;Let&#39;s Be Happy&#39; and &#39;Happy Go Lovely&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the latter, Cesar Romero plays an American impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in Edinburgh. There&#39;s a vague attempt to link this show to the Edinburgh Festival, which is nonsense: the Festival is not a showcase for splashy leg-shows. We also see a couple of stock shots of the Royal Mile: apart from a few Highland accents, there&#39;s absolutely no attempt to convey Scottish atmosphere in this movie. The funniest gag occurs at the very beginning, when we learn that the title of Romero&#39;s show is &#39;Frolics to You&#39;: this is a cheeky pun that Britons will get and Yanks won&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vera-Ellen is, as usual, cute and appealing and an impressive dancer, but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad. The plot -- mistaken identity between magnate David Niven and reporter Gordon Jackson -- is brainless, though no more so than the plots of several dozen Hollywood musicals. Romero is less annoying than usual here, probably because (for once) he isn&#39;t required to convince us that he&#39;s interested in bedding the heroine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of Bobby Howes. The father of Sally Ann Howes was a major star of West End stage musicals; his wistful rendition of &#34;She&#39;s My Lovely&#34; was a big hit in Britain in 1937. Here, he shows up in several scenes as Romero&#39;s dogsbody but never has a chance to participate in a musical number, nor even any real comedy. It&#39;s absolutely criminal that this movie -- with a title containing the word &#39;Lovely&#39;, sure to evoke Howes&#39;s greatest hit -- would cast a major British musical star but give him nothing to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delightful character actress Ambrosine Phillpotts (whom I worked with once) shines in one restaurant sequence, and there&#39;s a glimpse of the doomed beauty Kay Kendall. As Vera-Ellen&#39;s confidante, somebody named Diane Hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices I&#39;ve ever heard: it sounds like an attempt to imitate Joan Greenwood and Glynis Johns both at the same go, but doesn&#39;t match either. Val Guest has a story credit, but this movie doesn&#39;t come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies. The colour photography is wretched, though I realise that postwar Britain could not afford Hollywood&#39;s process work. &#39;Happy Go Lovely&#39; is at utmost best a pleasant time-waster, with &#39;waster&#39; being the operative word. I&#39;ll rate this movie just 4 out of 10.

A clever, undeniably entertaining romp starring Peter Ustinov as a career embezzler with his sights set on a US conglomerate in London. He&#39;s abetted by foxy (and deceptively sharp) Maggie Smith and threatened with exposure by jealous company man Bob Newhart. This is a heist film with a lot of brains. Ustinov is exceptional as is Smith and Newhart is quite funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden, as the pill popping &#34;executive vice-president.&#34; Malden has seldom been so loose. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley pop up in some funny cameos. The excellent music score is by Laurie Johnson. Eric Till&#39;s direction is brisk and the script by Ustinov and Ira Wallach is first-rate &amp; very smart. A swinging good time!

Before watching this film (at a screening attended by the director herself) we were informed this had won the short film prize at the Galway Film Fleadh. Surely this result will give filmmakers hope, anyone can do better than this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How anyone cannot notice the flagrant rip-off of Donnie Darko in this I&#39;ll never know. The film is pure drivel, the acting cardboard, the dialogue ridiculous &amp; the ending just flat! The only crumb of comfort we enjoyed after seeing this rubbish was to loudly comment on how dreadful it was, in front of the director! Yes that was mean, but liberating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least Irish film-making can&#39;t sink any lower!

When I first saw &#34;Race Against Fear&#34; (don&#39;t you just love LMN movie titles?), I had to keep scratching my head. Was this meant to be serious? Why couldn&#39;t the main character even run like a normal person running, much less like a star runner? How did I know that the coach was evil only 1 minute into the film? All of these questions, and no answers. Then, I just let the inane script and the awful directing just carry me away...it was easier not to resist...then the film became funnier by the minute, and I now rank it among my top ten junk movies from LMN. Some have said here that Ariana Richards is really talented but that the material was flawed - I heartily disagree. Not only can she not convince me that she&#39;s an athlete, she&#39;s walks wide-eyed through the rest of the story, like she&#39;s just landed on earth. Maybe the coach broke out of prison and finished her off...at least I hope so.

I may be a good old boy from Virginia in the Confederate States of America, but this man does it for me. That mustache gets me riled up. I remember when I first saw a video of his. That girl he beat was amazing. The depth of his acting when they cut to his weathered facade was a new level of masculinity. It reminds me of the granite sculptures of our Mt. Rushmore. If I could ask him one question, it would be,&#34;If you were a hot-dog, would you eat yourself?&#34; Will Orhan be doing a reunion tour? Take note from the greats like Gordon Lightfoot, true music from the heart never fades away. Vive La John Denver. Gracias my friend, O.F.F.L. (Orhan Fan For Life)

To quote Clark Griswold (in the original Christmas Vacation): &#34;WORSE? How could things get any worse? Take a look around here, Ellen. We&#39;re at the threshold of hell.&#34; Little did Chevy Chase know that he was describing the &#34;sequel&#34; to one of his best films. Christmas Vacation II sets a new high (or maybe it should be LOW) in bad movies. My wife bought this DVD thinking it would actually be a sequel to the original, but we were severely disappointed. This film is LAME. It bears no resemblance to the original, is an absolute waste of film, and an embarrassment to the otherwise good actors who had the misfortune to be part of it. It must have set a record on IMDb for the most bad reviews. I really think we have a good case to win a class action lawsuit to recover the money we consumers wasted on this movie.

Retro Puppet Master is complete and utter CRAP.In particular,the puppets look stupid,and crappy.The acting was unforgivable and the story was rancid.This movie goes back into the the past,where the dolls where first created,thats not Puppet Master.Retro Puppet Master is rated PG-13,the first Puppet Master to be rated PG-13.The movie contains no horror,or suspense.The fact that this movie was a Puppet Master film boggles the mind,because this installment doesnt have the buckets of blood,good acting,or any entertaiment like the previous movies did.Dont see this movie,dont rent it,and dont even watch it f its on TV,because this film is stale,not violent,and completely crappy.2 out of 10.As a Puppet Master fan,I am disappointed...seriously.

One of the intriguing aspects of this historical drama is the way the &#34;Tories&#34; or British American Loyalists are portrayed, and the sort of gloss given to their ardent support for King George III. In many ways the American Revolution was definitely a family affair, in that some of the wealthier colonial families were split asunder by it. If there is a strong criticism to be made of this film, it is that perhaps the people in this story are made out to be a little bit nicer than they were in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some regards, the actions of the character of Major Boulton, played by Cornel Wilde, make him the least likable member of the cast and the flaw in the storyline. He seems to vary from being a prickly kind of patriot to being a kind of &#39;anything for the cause,&#39; fellow. This film does concentrate heavily on the notions of personal honor and personal prestige which were a major social &#39;norm&#39; in that day and age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In its subtext, the fact that about twenty-five percent of the colonial population was decidedly pro-British is glossed over, too. But the strength of the Tory element is not obviously maligned, although the good doctor character is about eighty-five percent upper class twit ( to steal a fine phrase from Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus ). Anne Francis does a whole lot with a rather thin section of the script, and it stands out. She was a good choice for the woman of divided loyalties, a &#39;gal&#39; who was rather more modern than the social conventions of that day might have allowed -- if there had not been a life and death struggle going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One good aspect of the film is the way the rivalries of the American revolutionary leaders degenerated into outright jealousies, and how these personal conflicts very nearly sabotaged the entire revolutionary effort. All in all, the leading characters are very well drawn, the minor characters are not just human &#34;props&#34; and the fight scenes are believable enough to carry the dramatic action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great spy movie. It&#39;s not quite a great historical drama, but it does satisfy well enough. It rates a seven largely because Cornel Wilde is so deeply immersed in his role, and does it so well, and because Anne Francis makes the most of her supporting effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color print used on Turner Classic Movies was very clear, as well, and so it was an enjoyable presentation in that important regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it runs again soon.

Another great musical from Hollywoods Golden Age! I liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are performers at a small nightclub that is far from Broadway and all its glitter. Although not the big time they are very content with their lives and the small club where they perform. Gene Kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of its dancers, Rita Hayworth who happens to garner some attention when she&#39;s given an opportunity to be on a cover of a magazine. Trouble begins for Gene Kelly as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town. Phil Silvers plays one of the three friends and does a good job. Of course there is the music and the dancing. One dance performance by Gene Kelly stands out. He is walking along the street at night alone and he see his reflection in a shop window. His reflection soon starts dancing along with him in the streets, great cinematography. Don&#39;t miss this one, great entertainment.

I knew about this as a similar programme as Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes on Freeview, and it is the same, only more extreme. Basically three Welsh guys, and one mad British bloke were brought together by love of skateboarding, and a complete disregard/masochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety. They have had puking, eating pubes-covered pizza, jumping in stinging nettles, naked paint balling, jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleeping/snoring, stunts in a work place, e.g. army, cowboys, and many more insane stunts that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomit, maybe not just for themselves. Starring Matthew Pritchard who does pretty much anything, Lee Dainton also up for just about anything, Dan Joyce (the British one) who hardly does much physical stuff and has a OTT laugh, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does a lot, but is more popular for being short, fat and lazy. It was number something on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments. Very good!

The most die-hard worshippers of John Wayne will cringe when they watch The Lawless Frontier. Even for a poverty row studio, this one is one stinkeroo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unusual for a western we have a criminal who is a sex crime perpetrator. Earl Dwire plays a halfbreed white and Indian who for reasons that are not explained, pretends he&#39;s a Mexican, hokey accent and all. Dwire sounds like the Frito Bandito of advertising fame back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He and his gang happen upon Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheila Terry. They really don&#39;t have anything worth robbing, but Dwire just wants an excuse to kidnap Terry and have his way with her. She hears the dastardly fate she has in store and she and Hayes flee the ranch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where they happen to meet John Wayne who&#39;s on the trail of the bandits. They also run into one very stupid sheriff who believes Wayne is one of the bandits. Again for reasons I can&#39;t quite fathom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a tough way to earn a living grinding out horse operas like these for the Duke. Fortunately better things were on the way.

This documentary on schlockmeister William Castle takes a few cheap shots at the naive &#39;50s-&#39;60s environment in which he did his most characteristic work--look at the funny, silly people with the ghost-glasses--but it&#39;s also affectionate and lively, with particularly bright commentary from John Waters, who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time, and from Castle&#39;s daughter, who adored her dad and also is pretty perceptive about how he plied his craft. (We never find out what became of the other Castle offspring.) The movies were not very good, it makes clear, but his marketing of them was brilliant, and he appears to have been a sweet, hardworking family man. Fun people keep popping up, like &#34;Straight Jacket&#34;&#39;s Diane Baker, who looks great, and Anne Helm, whom she replaced at the instigation of star Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman all but explodes into giggles at the happy memory of working with Castle on &#34;The Tingler,&#34; and there&#39;s enough footage to give us an idea of the level of Castle&#39;s talent--not very high, but very energetic. A pleasant look at a time when audiences were more easily pleased, and it does make you nostalgic for simpler movie-going days.

A movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on its ear should be fun, romantic and easy-going entertainment. Instead this movie is more about things not said and not expressed, so it gets to the point where you are grateful anything is said at all, even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILER --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the relationship that says the most is the one least seen on the screen (Danner and McEwan), you know you&#39;re in trouble. But those two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie screaming for some genuine people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;END OF SPOILER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Capshaw is given the task of creating a character from not much and she is not entirely successful. Like I said above, the theme seems to be repression and I understand that is an element of life and love but I don&#39;t want to see a movie about it either, at least not this one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t recommend this at all, despite the very talented cast who are left to fend for themselves.

This is possibly the worst fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so called sports fencing is poor but because the plot, characters are so weak that they&#39;ve got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, I suppose to maintain audience interest. What a waste of F. Murray Abraham&#39;s talents. You&#39;re better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer myself I recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens it&#39;s got to have fresher, better drawn characters and a plot with more depth.

This is one of the better Marion Davies talkies - and one of the few to allow her to exhibit her skill as a physical comedian which was so endearing in her silent films. OK, so she does a clunky tap number, but even Ruby Keeler&#39;s dancing from the era does not hold up for younger generations. The problem here is the script. The story falls into unbelievable melodrama in the last reel. It&#39;s quite stagey, and is obviously adapted from a play... but not well enough. Still, there is some snappy dialogue and slapstick throughout. Worth a look.

This was my first introduction to the world of Bollywood and I&#39;m now hooked! Okay so it requires adoption of a different mindset to watching US films but once you allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying it for what it is you won&#39;t be disappointed. The songs are superb, melodic and very catchy. The actors are visually compelling especially Karisma Kapoor who is surely one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the film world. Locations, colour are spellbinding. If you want something different and are looking to be uplifted, cheered up and stimulated I recommend you catch this movie.

*** SPOILERS***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the worst films I&#39;ve seen since last years &#34;The Village.&#34; An insult to anyone of any intelligence at all. Poorly written and astonishingly contrived. Nobody, especially in Los Angeles talks the way these characters do. No subtly at all. If the point of this film is to say that &#34;we all have a little bit of bigotry in us&#34; he does a horrible job of stating the obvious. Not only was his point clearly base, but every character in this film was AMAZINGLY STUPID. The car jacking scene almost made me walk out, along with the rescue and oh lets not forget the WHITE off DUTY Rookie COP picking up a hitchhiking black thug and... I could go on and on. Awful, just awful.

One of the more lucid statements against the death penalty ever filmed, quite a frontal attack against the most disgusting way of doing justice. The final sequence, with that parallel between the crimes that the convicted Poncelet committed and his own execution are just superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, what about the work of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon? It leaves you breathless, they&#39;re two giants and their performances achieve the highest levels of emotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim Robbins put clear that he&#39;s not only a good actor, he&#39;s a nice director as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*My rate: 9/10

The film begins with Ingrid Bergman and her two freaky servants arriving in New Orleans from Paris. Apparently years earlier, her mother was involved in a scandal and Ingrid returned in an effort to irritate kin who would have sooner forgotten she or her mother existed. That&#39;s because she reasons if they are shocked enough, they&#39;ll pay her off to get rid of her. Then, with this money, she will leave New Orleans and seek out a millionaire somewhere else, as she poses as a Countess. Along the way, Gary Cooper shows up and looks totally out of place as a love interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s amazing that this film wasn&#39;t the reason that Ingrid Bergman&#39;s film career plummeted--her performance and character were THAT bad! Instead of the classy and demure female she usually played in films, she is probably one of the most annoying characters in film. Her fake Contessa was shallow, demanding, unpredictable and stupefyingly dumb. How she was able to vamp ANY man seemed a mystery, as she seemed less vampish than just plain nuts!! I am not exaggerating to say that she behaved, at times, like someone with a combination of a severe mental illness and a personality disorder, and all these together make me think &#34;who in the world would fall in love with this mess?!&#34;. Frankly, I couldn&#39;t stand watching her histrionics and narcissistic behavior and she looked more like a guest on &#34;The Jerry Springer Show&#34; than a leading lady! Confusing, awful and overacted are words that come to mind when I think about her role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the cast is, frankly, overwhelmed by Bergman&#39;s ranting and hysterics. While Gary Cooper is generally an excellent leading man, he is dominated by her and just looks lost. And, oddly, they cast two total weirdos as her entourage--Flora Robson and Jerry Austin. Ms. Robson is best known for her portrayals of Queen Elizabeth I, but here, for some odd reason, they coated her in makeup and the end result looked much like the love child of a cigar store Indian and Aunt Jemima! Her face was very wooden, she sported odd eyebrows and she dressed like a slave. As for Mr. Austin, he was a dwarf and while this shouldn&#39;t be held against him, his role was written like he was a court jester--a very, very thankless role for someone who is &#34;vertically challenged&#34;! Overall, the rotten acting, writing and limp direction make this one of the big stinkers of the age--nearly as pointless and dull as such famous turkeys as PARNELL and SWING YOUR LADY.

The year 2000 had been a bad year for indian films due to lack of quality and imagination from film directors. Other than Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai nothing stood out. CCCC had lot of contraversy due to the financing of the film and this with not really knowing what the film is about has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film around India and Abroad. The only information given was that it was a suspense thriller. The film is now been released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly quite good. The main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled. Salman And Preiti give a good performance where Salman doesn&#39;t actually take is shirt off at all..must be special effects!! Rani plays Salmans wife but it is slightly a less demanding role compared with Preiti who plays Prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother. The three main leads confirm, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, they have a solid on screen and off screen chemistry(apparently). Salman Khan who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the Mumbai film industry partly due to the films he chooses. Rani&#39;s Character does not know Preiti is a prostitute until the end...this kept from her and the rest of the family...the rest you should find out as it will ruin the film if i told you. The songs are all picturised well especially dekhne walon and the main title song. The other supporting actors do a minimal but fine effort as Salmans loving family. Abbas Mastan has produced a hit and handled the film subject tactfully..I say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer!

One of the scariest movies I have ever seen was Carrie (the first one!). Now, as with other movies, they have totally ruined the Carrie franchise with The Rage: Carrie 2. From the beginnning, the movie plods along like geriatics in a beat-up van. There are hardly any scares and this movie is chock-full of all the various high-school sterotypes (i.e. the football jock, the bitchy cheer-leader, the followers and of course the black nailpolish wearing misfits). Another sad thing about this show is that you know what&#39;s going to happen the moment you see the opening credits. Sure, sure, girl gets humilated thourghly and then turns into crazed psychic murderer...yawn...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been there. Done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the actors look like they were forced into doing this movie. Emily Bergl is as frightening as a cabbage patch doll while Jack London... let&#39;s just say i didn&#39;t pay to see wood act. Apart from the actors, the flasbacks serve more to irritate than to link up with the first movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, If you can beam objects around like Carrie, then for the love of God beam yourself out of that theatre......

&#34;I presume you are here for damage to your mental circuitry.&#34; - VAL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Nelson made me watch this...he mentioned it in his book, &#34;Movie Megacheese.&#34; I asked myself, &#34;Why would Mike Nelson steer me wrong?&#34; I now know why the bots never trusted Mike Nelson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music is by John Williams, which is probably part of his payment to the Devil. In fact, I&#39;m sure anyone who worked on this movie is probably in league with ol&#39; Slewfoot, or is now cursed, from the Executive Director down to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio. Don&#39;t watch...for the love of God...don&#39;t watch!!! Not even making a copy and showing someone else will un-curse you...I&#39;m doomed now, I understand this. I accept this. But save yourself...

As with all of Angelopoulos&#39; films, &#34;The Suspended Step of the Stork&#34; implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer, a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work. Dialogues are sparing, with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters&#39; inner conflicts, doubts, or feelings. The filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses, and instead forces them to explore and study the characters&#39; identities for themselves. As a result, the acting is understated and implicit, as opposed to overt and explicit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation, where the viewer is asked to become a participant, to participate as an actor, by probing his or her own psyche. As in a novel, where the drama rests entirely on the author&#39;s writing to provide a template where the reader&#39;s imagination and/or past experience flourish, Angelopoulos&#39; drama rests within his images: his uses of the long shots, the long takes, the leisurely pacing, the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark, inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective. Angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity, reverting to the non-verbal language of gestures, gazes, sounds, and music, when he believes that words can only take us so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music, by Angelopoulos&#39; long time collaborator, Eleni Karaindrou, provides more than just a discreet background, but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story. A large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle, subdued colors, recorded in a drab winter light. Angelopoulos presents us with an &#34;other Greece,&#34; one far different from the Greece of the tourist brochures, with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas, drowned in an eternal sunshine. Here, the skies are covered and gray, the air is cold and misty, and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled, dirty snow of the village streets. Angelopoulos&#39; genius through Arvanitis&#39; camera is on display throughout the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Suspended Step of the Stork&#34; is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio-political situation in the Balkans at the end of the twentieth century. It is deeply concerned with the meaning of &#34;borders,&#34; and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations. In the &#34;waiting room&#34; facing the Albanian border, the refugees, political or other, outcast by the rest of humanity, wait. They may be stuck against a political border, but unfortunately they still carry with them, and hang on, deeper ancestral borders: those of the languages, of the customs, and of the races. Although Angelopoulos&#39; political views are well known, the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees&#39; plights. In the process, Angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical, cultural, political, and personal &#34;borders.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century Greece, and he likes to bring lessons from the Hellenic myths into his discussions. In this film, he does some border crossing himself between the Greek and Italian cultures, drawing from a combined Homeric and Dantesque tradition of Odysseus&#39; travel. Alexander is a Telemachus, in search of a story about an aging Greek politician/Odysseus who disappeared, never to be heard of again. This political man, a brilliant orator, unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence, his wife, and his brilliant career, to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low. He became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world. Of course, the &#34;politician&#34; is not Alexander&#39;s father, but the &#34;politician&#34; stands before Alexander like a father figure/Odysseus. As with Homer&#39;s Telemachus, Alexander grows as a person during his odyssey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of Homer&#39;s Odyssey in a contemporary context. Angelopoulos draws on Odysseus&#39;s travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film. In Angelopoulos&#39; ending, &#34;Odysseus&#34; is more like the Dante&#39;s Odysseus: he does not leave for Ithaca but goes on, &#34;carrying a suitcase.&#34; And Alexander/Telemachus is &#34;suspended&#34; between returning to his home and his career, or embarking on a voyage to &#34;somewhere else.&#34; He states as much, in a voice-over at the beginning of the film, paraphrasing few lines from Dante&#39;s &#34;Inferno&#34;: &#34;And don&#39;t forget that the time for a voyage has come again. The wind blows your eyes far away.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, although Angelopoulos is not a religious person, there is a Greek Orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow-suited linesmen, who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications, and also the Christ-like figure of the &#34;politician.&#34; In the final scene, these men in yellow demonstrate once more the Byzantine iconography&#39;s influence in Angelopoulos&#39; work. They appear like &#34;stylites,&#34; religious figures found in the Orthodox tradition, solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars, in a form of asceticism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by Mastroianni. Angelopoulos does not give us any clues, and the wife&#39;s statement, &#34;It&#39;s not him,&#34; is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough. The important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician, but that he could be the politician. But the film still ends on an optimistic note. Whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river, and thus communications across the border are still not possible, and it remains impenetrable, we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river: the camera has crossed the border, and the reverse tracking shot is inviting Alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary. On this account, Angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow, some of the borders will eventually crumble.

Salva and his pal Bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives. We see them panhandling in a car of the underground, where their pitch to get donations is so lame, no one gives them anything! Salva, who is a hardened petty criminal doesn&#39;t even have any redeeming qualities, that is, until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next. Religion and show business prove to be a winning combination, something that Salva capitalizes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He and Bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo. Salva shows he is a natural for the reality show. He transforms himself into a Christ-like figure who is an instant success in the program. Espe, who is a no-nonsense woman who is show&#39;s producer, can&#39;t escape from the way Salva pays her unusual attention. Ultimately, Salva is the victim of his own success in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jordi Molla, whose first directorial job this movie is, had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television. Spain, which was vulnerable to these types of programs, has seen its share of the bizarre, which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ensemble cast has some good moments in the film. Mr. Molla, like any actor who decides to direct his first feature, would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons for watching the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director.

1992&#39;s &#34;Batman Returns&#34; was Tim Burton&#39;s second round as director and yet again he scored a hit by making this film again dark and gloomy like his 1989 one. Gotham City again is a place of darkness and gloom with crime and corruption boiling out from every street corner. It was also clever to see how Burton used politics as a subplot that tied in well and neat with the business corruption of businessman Max Shreck(Christopher Walken)and the plan to make the &#34;Penguin&#34;(Danny DeVito) mayor of Gotham! Anyway Keaton again returns as &#34;Batman&#34;/Bruce Wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and torn man who just can&#39;t find love in a normal world yet he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in Selina Kyle only Ms. Kyle has a dark secret of her own one that&#39;s very slinky and she&#39;s just a downright vamp as the sexy and mysterious yet dangerous &#34;Catwoman&#34;(Michelle Pfeiffer). A plan forms between both villains to destroy Gotham and most of all both want to rid themselves of the bat. Really this film even though violent and somewhat gross with many penguin scenes is clearly an exciting thrill ride from start to finish as you never find a dull moment and thumbs up to Tim again for his exploring of the characters as dark and conflicted it just made the film even more interesting. The performance from Michelle Pfeiffer was the best ever as no one could have played &#34;The Catwoman&#34; any better and Devito was perfect as the &#34;Penguin&#34; his body frame fit the character just perfect his performance even though ghoulish was fun to watch. &#34;Batman Returns&#34; is an entertaining thrill ride that you can&#39;t take your eyes off of as a viewer you will enjoy it many times it&#39;s that thrilling and explosive.

I like this film a lot. It has a wonderful chemistry between the actors and tells a story that is pretty universal, the story of the prodigal son. The aspect I like the best however was the way that the bath house was more than just a background for the story. As the father told the son the story of his wife&#39;s family in the northern deserts of china, the element of water and bathing becomes an almost sacred ritual. Water was so scarce that a simple bath had profound depth and meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the film was very effective. There were moments, however, when it verged on &#34;too&#34; sweet...bordering on cloying during the park recital scene. But overall, I highly recommend this film.

This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn&#39;t believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff. This was a funny episode about Cartman faking Tourette syndrome. I Recommend it to any South Park fan.

Like the great classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at different levels. I just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. Both enjoyed the movie - busting out laughing quite a few times... and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan. The movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times... the adult-level humor (that is, humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences, no baudy or R-rated stuff to be found here) keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults. For example of the adult level humor, the Martian voices are based on characters of different movies/actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and mannerisms of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, that of Peter Seller&#39;s Dr. Strangelove. The special effects are surprisingly good for this film. The lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie&#39;s favor, and the actors/actresses play their part well - in fact I would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles&#39; needs over box-office draw power (an excellent example is Wayne Alexander&#39;s &#34;Vern&#34; character). I had to write this review... the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now. Good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there&#39;s-nothing-on-and-I&#39;m-bored movie.

(Spoilers more than likely... nothing really important you couldn&#39;t have figured out yourselves) Yeah, it&#39;s really weird. I rented it at a Blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely NO description of the movie on the back of the box, only a list of the bands that had songs in it. But after that, I had a dikens of a time finding it, even here on IMDB. I kept confusing it with &#34;Night of the Demons,&#34; but, you know, they&#39;re basically the same thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parts I loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage. That black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed ALL the time. Even when screaming wasn&#39;t really necessary, he&#39;d let out a &#34;LISTEN UP NOW!! BLOCK THE DOOR WITH CARS!!!!&#34; and so, they&#39;d run cars head on into other cars. But, then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick I believe it was. The other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl didn&#39;t want to come over... To what significant aspect of the movie did that give us? What was it? Why was it there? Why did the movie end with a guy breaking the TV&#39;s in a studio? I saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen, but he was kinda far away. I mean, he could have just turned the TV off. Yes, this movie was shot on a whim and yes, I hated it. Good day...

The impossibly sexy Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, a new nurse at one of those movie-type asylums where the doctor in charge has his own, unorthodox ways of treating the inmates. Reluctantly bringing her on board is the officious Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams, a.k.a. Annabelle Weenick). The inmates don&#39;t take too kindly to Charlotte, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part mystery, part horror, this initial effort from B-movie director S.F. Brownrigg has an oppressive feel to it. These colorful psychos, including a nymphomaniac with no self-esteem, a gentle giant who&#39;s already had a lobotomy, and a supposed &#34;judge&#34; who speaks in legalese jargon, dominate the screen with their unnerving presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a picture that works fairly well, establishing the gritty, grim atmosphere right from the get go. Some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old fashioned exploitative quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It builds in intensity as the imperiled heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity, offering one surreal encounter after another. Particularly effective is the poetry-quoting, dotty old Mrs. Callingham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For cheap 1970&#39;s era cheese, it&#39;s pretty effective, with a particularly nasty climax. I had a pretty good time watching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10

There are so many good things to say about this “B” movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“B’ maybe in connections, but not in commission. This is about the best of its genre that I have ever seen. A grade A effort by Universal. The script is well done, imaginative, and without fault. Writing credits: Howard Higgin original story &amp; Douglas Hodges story, John Colton (screenplay). Director Lambert Hillyer handled the complex story and story locations very well. No skimping on the loads of extras and locations. I loved Beulah Bondy (Jimmy Stewarts mother in “It’s A Wonderful Life”. The fem lead, Frances Drake is a beauty and handled her part with grace and pathos for her Karloff husband. Lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed. I think this is the best part I remember seeing him in. As I said there were so many good things: the African discovery of the Radium “X”, the melting of the stone statues ((somewhat reminiscent of the Ten Little Indians in And Then There Were None (Agatha Christie) (the Barry Fitzgerald version)), the glowing of Karlof in the dark. Karloff’s mother played by Violet Kemble Cooper with elegance. And because of all these virtues, I found myself believing in the science it portrayed. I guess that’s the mark of a good piece of art.

I first heard of this film when Patton Oswalt talked about it on his &#34;Werewolves and Lollipops&#34; CD. He said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous. Being a lover of terrible cinema, I knew I was in for a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is, hands down, one of the weirdest I&#39;ve ever seen. Certainly one of the weirdest shlock films. Basically, a demon took human form years ago for a woman, the woman died or something, the demon cried blood, the blood fell on the bed, the bed is now possessed and it now eats. Along with fruit, flowers and chicken, it also has a taste for people. The people can range between horny teens, mayors, gangsters, servants or professional orgy throwers. There&#39;s also a sick guy who the bed ate but put his soul behind a picture in the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most movies let you figure out the plot through exciting action. Death Bed takes another path: it basically tells you through narration exactly what&#39;s happening while slow, dull murder scenes take place. Also, I must say everyone who&#39;s eaten by the bed are surprisingly quiet. I would think if a bed is eating you through the ways of a 5th grade science fair experiment, it would sting a little. I guess nerve endings weren&#39;t invented until 1981 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is wacky, the direction is slow and pretty awful, the sets are sparse, the acting it fairly painful and the brother is one of the unintentionally ugliest actors I&#39;ve ever seen. Probably would make a great party film if alcohol and smart-asses are involved. Certainly one you shouldn&#39;t miss.

Well after three times through I still have no idea what this movie is about because, quite honestly, it failed to generate any real interest or concern. But here it goes: A bunch of too old to be teen Teen Actors dressed in horrifying latter 1980&#39;s fashions (did WE look like that too??) decide it would be a really good idea to get in a motorboat and go visit the abandoned Alcatraz after one of them has nightmares of people being slaughtered in various horrifying ways that manage to rip off POLTERGEIST, THE EVIL DEAD, and Freddy Kreuger in one fell swoop. The dimwit even envisions himself being roasted over an open fire with some deformed freak slicing off strips of tenderloin. Good thing it was only a dream or it might have hurt, and good thing his dreams had a decent special effects budget. Mine are usually pretty lame: Girls, model space ships, blowing things up with a bazooka, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once on the Alcatraz island they find themselves in a Slasher movie, and meet up with Tony Basil, who cannot help but break into a couple dance poses at times and had her own lighting crew (complete with a smoke machine for that 1980&#39;s smoky haze infused light look, which I kind of miss). And such reminded me that Ms. Basil helped choreograph David Byrne of the Talking Heads for some of his videos and performances. This of course has nothing at all to do with the film but kept popping into mind as the movie posed very little to actually think about. It sort of happens, and you can either watch or keep working on your page markup with it on the TV set off to the side. But since the film isn&#39;t really interesting, you&#39;ll keep deciding to finish one last thing instead of wasting time, the movie will keep ending, and you&#39;ll find yourself wondering what you missed every time you realize the end credits are starting to roll again, dammit ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*SOME* 1980&#39;s Teen Horror movies can survive such specialized viewing: Umberto Lenzi&#39;s GHOSTHOUSE, CHOPPING MALL &amp; it&#39;s Killbots, the hard to ignore NIGHT OF THE CREEPS and the over-the-top SLEEPAWAY CAMP all come to mind. They are films that, like them or not, demand your attention and usually pay off with some good gore or T&amp;A, and typos in your work as evidence that you were watching the TV instead of your keyboard. I am sure that HELL ISLAND (as the British version I glommed onto is titled) does indeed have some good stuff in there, but frankly I don&#39;t care. And nothing is more annoying that encountering art of any genre that doesn&#39;t inspire admiration, some decent dislike or even good old honest hatred for it. The film is content with simpering away 80-whatever minutes of time and never really accomplishing anything more than being a sometimes distraction in spite of my best efforts to try and give it a chance, but no dice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some offbeat production design going on, the use of lighting is striking at times, and the occasional outburst of mayhem will probably keep fans of 1980&#39;s Teen Horror interested. The rest of you be warned though: YOU WILL WONDER IF YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT IN 1987, and the answer is probably more hideous than anything which happens on screen. Try to watch it as a free rental if possible so that if disappointed you aren&#39;t stuck with the damn thing: Movies like this take up valuable shelf space that is often at a commodity these days, what with the world coming to an end &amp; all ...

I had long wanted to watch this romantic drama (with a WWII setting) and, now that I have, all I can say is that it&#39;s a veritable masterpiece of Russian cinema! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soviet films are known for their overzealous propagandist approach but, thankfully, this one&#39;s free of such emphasis - with the interest firmly on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vivacious girl, doomed by the outbreak of war for which he gladly volunteers but from which he&#39;ll never return. The girl (a remarkable performance from Tatyana Samojlova) is also loved by the young man&#39;s cousin and, when she doesn&#39;t receive word from her boyfriend, gives in to the latter and marries him. He, however, is an aspiring concert pianist bitter about the war having curtailed his chances for success and, knowing too that the girl&#39;s still devoted to the soldier, begins to neglect her. Finally, word reaches the girl of her loved one&#39;s death but, by the end of the film, she has learnt to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and is content to live with her memories of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film features some truly amazing camera-work which makes extremely judicious use of the screen space and, by frequently adopting tracking, tilted and high or low angle shots, renders great power to the unfolding emotional drama. Individual sequences are equally impressive - two in particular: the stunning scene, frenetically edited and sped-up to boot, in which the girl saves an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck; and the young man&#39;s premature demise in an unfortunate incident at the front, undoubtedly one of the best of its kind I&#39;ve ever watched (with the sun moving away from him, symbolizing the life that&#39;s seeping out of his body, as he imagines the wedding day he&#39;ll never have!). Also notable, however, is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home that&#39;s been hopelessly devastated during an air raid; as is her final violent capitulation to the concert pianist - which she tries to resist by repeatedly slapping him in the face - taking place during a later air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of billowing curtains!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointingly, the R1 DVD of this outstanding film is a bare-bones affair (the RusCiCo edition features a few supplements but, being an export, tends to be heavily overpriced and hard to track down to boot!); Criterion released it in conjunction with another war-themed Russian classic, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER (1959) - which my pal at the local DVD rental outlet has told me is forthcoming... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other film I&#39;ve watched from this director is the Arctic epic THE RED TENT (1969; albeit via the much-shorter U.S.-release version!), a star-studded international production based on true events; given the unmistakable artistic quality of THE CRANES ARE FLYING, I regret missing out now on his famous documentary I AM CUBA (1964) a number of times when I was in Hollywood late last year: apart from receiving a one-week theatrical run, it was shown more than once on TV accompanied by a feature-length &#34;Making Of&#34;!!

Now, I&#39;ve seen many many B-grade films in my 15 years of living, and I must say that this was one of the better ones. I personally enjoyed the real estate and the storyline, but it did suffer from amateur acting (although Adrienne Barbeau did give a decent performance as Lisa Grant). Joseph Bottoms couldn&#39;t hold his part well enough to be considered good. The other performance which really fit the film was that of Barry Hope (Barney Resnick). It begins with an eager real estate agent taking an Asian couple through a house, only to find there&#39;s a dead girl in the shower of the showhome. It progresses with detective speculating, and introduces the key characters with reasonable grace. I think that for any person who&#39;s in for a giggle at the over-the-top drama the victim realtors provide during the over-the-top gory scenes, this truly is a gem... XD Who am I kidding? It&#39;s not that great, but worth a watch if you&#39;re insanely bored.

The John Van Druten Broadway hit is brought to the screen with a maximum of star power in this romantic fantasy about a modern-day witch who beguiles a successful Manhattan publisher. James Stewart may get top billing, but it is Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most alluring witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen. The lead pairing is, in fact, one of the movie&#39;s few weaknesses: the gray-haired Stewart seems a bit old for the role, and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for Novak, it&#39;s a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him, as they seem mismatched in temperment and outlook. (It is one of the story&#39;s amusing conceits that witches and warlocks are portrayed as Greenwich Village beatniks and bohemians.) Curiously, the Stewart-Novak pairing would generate a lot more heat in &#34;Vertigo&#34;, released the same year as this film, but then &#34;Vertigo&#34; had a compelling suspense story, and the benefit of Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film&#39;s comic moments are mostly provided by the stellar supporting cast, including a young Jack Lemmon (as Kim&#39;s warlock brother), Elsa Lanchester (their ditzy aunt), and Ernie Kovacs (!) as a befuddled writer. Hermione Gingold even shows up in a hilarious cameo as a sort of Grand Witch. There&#39;s lots to like in this movie--wit, romance, and a great cast--that is, if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting Miss Novak. I have seen the movie a half a dozen times, and I never can.

Very reliable entertainment, as Las Vegas amuses as well as intrigues, very light hearted and very much bolstered by Josh Duhanel!! I like this television show and I think that many people watch it as a form of escapist voyeurism...Voyeurism in this case is very positive, and many females in this series are very nice to look at...This show incorporates Las Vegas legends such as Wayne Newton as intermittent characters to authenticate the Las Vegas genre!! There have been copious depictions of sin city, this is one of the better efforts...The producers and directors are lucky to have James Caan in the show, as he is very much a totally accomplished actor!!! By and large, I like the T.V. Show Las Vegas and I watch it on Fridays, I watched it on Mondays as well, but with Monday Night Football, I could see why NBC switched it to Fridays...Nonetheless, I like Las Vegas a lot!!

Well then, what is it?! I found Nicholson&#39;s character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting. Angelica Huston&#39;s character drained my power. And Kathleen Turner is a filthy no good slut. It&#39;s not that I &#34;don&#39;t get it&#34;. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think that some of the ideas could&#39;ve lead to something more. This is a film with nothing but the notion that we&#39;re supposed to accept these ideas, and that&#39;s what the movie has going for it. That Nicholson falls for Turner is absurd, but then again, it is intended to be so. This however does not strike me as a.)funny, or b.)...even remotely interesting!!! This was a waste of my time, so don&#39;t let the hype get the best of you...it is a waste of your time! With all that being said, the opening church sequence is quite beautiful...

A Time To Kill is based on John Grisham&#39;s first novel, the one he wrote before he was famous, and the one that didn&#39;t skyrocket him to fame. (That would be accomplished by &#34;The Firm&#34;). That&#39;s why this movie didn&#39;t get made until much later, after Grisham was off churning out meaningless books with the movie dollar signs fresh in his head. Unlike most of those, this book was actually about something. It had meat, it had weight, and it had heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it also had a fatal flaw, and this fatal flaw gets translated into the movie. Namely, &#34;A Time To Kill&#34; sets you up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we have a black man (Jackson), on trial for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10-year-old daughter. We have an underdog lawyer (McConaughey) battling the big bad system to save his client. And oh, by the way, the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in Mississippi, complete with hooded KKK men burning crosses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, we&#39;re supposed to sympathize with Carl Lee Hailey. We&#39;re supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. We&#39;re supposed to feel the injustice of a system where a racist all-white jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge a brutal crime. We&#39;re supposed feel like we&#39;re standing alongside the people chanting &#34;Free Carl Lee&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the racism issue is a smokescreen, and the whole thing is contrived. Carl Lee Hailey was a vigilante. Yes, there were mitigating circumstances for what he did, but the fact remains that he wasn&#39;t innocent. This would have been true no matter what his skin colour, or the skin colour of the assailants of his daughter, the judge, the jury, or anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what&#39;s so heavy-handed about this film is that it paints anyone who believes Carl Lee should have been convicted is a racist. The message seems to be that if you believe that the law shouldn&#39;t be taken into people&#39;s own hands, then you might as well be burning crosses on a lawn somewhere wearing a hood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#39;t the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this, and it won&#39;t be the last. As a movie, A Time To Kill stays pretty faithful to the book, and the acting isn&#39;t half bad. But it played the hand it had been dealt, really. Even a good cast can&#39;t elevate bad source material.

I&#39;m not sure what HK movies the other reviewers have been watching, but Enter the Eagles is nowhere near the top of the heap in HK action. Michael &#34;Fitz&#34; Wong should be glad he can get acting jobs in HK, because he couldn&#39;t act his way out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter (even better with the leg fighting than her dad), but her acting skills are also sub-par. In fact, all the English dialog (90% of the movie--even more than in Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I switched to Mandarin audio just to spare myself the misery of the bad dialog delivery and the redundancy of the English subs. Sure, there are some decent gunfights (but nothing we haven&#39;t already seen before) and good cinematography, but the cheesy visual effects really spoil the action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it&#39;s worth the price of admission to watch Shannon and Benny &#34;The Jet&#34; Urquidez go at it. Spectacular, and almost worth watching the rest of the movie for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, you might notice some scenes that seem &#34;familiar&#34; to you, notably a shootout at an outdoor market (think Matrix) and Fitz diving out of a helicopter wearing black fatigues (think MI:2). Guess someone thought at least a few things in this flick were worth ripping off.

I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I&#39;m 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve even mentioned the movie to anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago. I think the innocence of the charactors, their situation, their mutual affection over a long period of time, left a long term imprint for reasons I don&#39;t quite understand. Maybe it is because I was a teenager at the time I saw it, and it touched me somehow..... I really don&#39;t know! I also REALLY wanted to know what was going to happen when the after the end of the film happened. Oh, the agony!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve not seen it before, or since, but I would love to. I keep a casual look out for it, but I now doubt it will been shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion. But I&#39;d proberbly miss it in the TV guide even if it DID show up. Pssttt!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the reviews here has renewed my interest. If anyone knows of its availability in Australia, by all means email me and let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and Sean Bury... nice to see you make an appearance on the comments here. I&#39;ve had a look at your movie history and noticed your last appearance in a James Bond film. What are you up to these day? Oh, and do YOU have a copy of the film? CHEERS!!!

I first caught the movie on its first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 and being 15 years old I thought the movie was hilarious. I remember NOT seeing the Alfred E. Neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine satired the movie and abruptly halted half way through with apologies from the &#34;usual gang&#34; for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap, I just assumed they were poking fun at themselves, which I&#39;m sure they were, but to seriously find them ( and Ron Liebman ) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits, I was quite surprised. Surely there are many worse movies to be associated with. Watching the movie on video now (at age 32) with the MAD references restored, I still get a kick out of it. And being a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where&#39;s Poppa?) I think it&#39;s his crown jewel of performances (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JURASSIC PARK III *___ Adventure &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam Nell (The Dish), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ(a Leoni (Family Man)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better title would be: ESCAPE FROM THE ISLAND OF REALLY MEAN DINOSAURS. But then no one would need to see the film. In this sequel, a rag-tag group pays a visit to the island of dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim of a hang-gliding accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports JP3 began filming without a completed script. That explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state-of-the-art special effects. Sure, there are a few clever scenes and some moderately funny bits, but no meaningful plot line to tie them together. The dinosaur puppets and animation in JP3 are very good to excellent, and more numerous than ever. But the overall film experience can not hold a candle to the original JURASSIC PARK or even JP2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JP3 is a mercifully short 90 minutes -- the last 10 minutes of which is credits. Even at that, I found myself frequently checking my wristwatch. The audience I saw it with left the theater in silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better bet: see the movie LEGALLY BLONDE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave

Director Spike Lee is famous for making films pointing out racism. In many of films, such &#34;Do The Right Thing,&#34; most of the white people are all brutal racists. In this movie, interracial marriage is the subject, with racism once again being the entire issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Lee does, however, is once again demonstrate his bigotry against Christianity. It&#39;s amazing the double standards that exist in the film world. If Lee or anyone else ever produced this kind of bias against another group he would be vilified, but Christians? Hey, it&#39;s &#34;open season&#34; on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ossie Davis, a reverend in this film, shoots his son and then puts the smoldering gun down on top of his Bible. They zoom in on that for another closeup just in case you missed it. Hey, folks, here&#39;s another Bible reader and look what he&#39;&#39;s like! Lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie he makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He shows the same hatred when dealing with race relations. Who could argue with portraying racism as an evil thing? However, Lee perpetuates it in this film as he has in his other films. His obvious bitterness toward white people doesn&#39;t help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, Spike: start &#34;doing the right thing&#34; and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet, &#34;get over it.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is too bad because the subject matter could have made for a thought- provoking film if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence.

Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael McGuire was the dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in &#39;82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll &amp; Hyde theme ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course. with all the cocaine references in this movie, it&#39;d be panned as being way too politically incorrect today, as would Cheech and Chong. Too bad, because it is FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY!

According to this masterpiece of film-making&#39;s script (pun intended), Charles Darwin was full of nonsense when he presented his evolution theory, because he made absolutely no mention of any alien intervention. For you see, aliens sent Chupacabras to the earth and they form the missing link in the evolution theory. However, the rest of the film clearly seems to emphasize that Chupacabras are a typically Puerto Rican phenomenon, so I don&#39;t really know where that fits in. Are they saying all Puerto Ricans are aliens? Whatever, it&#39;s all pretty irrelevant anyway. The only thing you need to memorize is that &#34;El Chupacabre&#34; is an utterly cheap and imbecilic amateur B-movie, lacking tension, character development and any form of style. Several duos of people are chasing this goat-munching monster (remotely resembling the midget version of the Pumpkinhead demon) through the streets and ghettos of an ugly city. We have an untalented dogcatcher and a nagging female novelist, a pair of obnoxious cops and the supposedly evil scientist with his dim-witted accomplice. Since they all are extremely incompetent in what they do, the monster can carelessly carry on devouring all the Latino immigrants of the neighborhood. The monster itself looks okay and the make-up effects on his victims&#39; leftovers are acceptably gross and bloody. The acting performances are irredeemably awful and headache inducing. Particularly Eric Alegria is pitiable in his first and only lead role as the overly ambitious employee of Animal Control. Yes, it&#39;s an incredibly stupid film, but surely you have struggled yourself through worse and less amusing low-budget garbage.

OK, if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and love to mock movies, then you will have a lot of fun with this. Otherwise, it may really be TOO painful to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot: Obsessed cryptozoologist sneaks a huge crate containing a Chupacabra onto a cruise ship (apparently not having to declare it at customs, or even mention that he&#39;s bringing aboard a live animal -&#34;no really, it&#39;s research equipment, the air holes are just an accident&#34;). Some dipsticks he hired to lade it open the crate, figuring he paid bunches of money, maybe there&#39;s something to steal. Once the WOOD CRATE is open, the Chupacabra breaks through the STEEL BARS inside and goes on a killing rampage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By a stroke of sheer coincidence, a Marshall (I assume a U.S. Marshall, since he was in the gulf war, not just some guy named Marshall) is on board, investigating some money that went missing from the ship&#39;s safe. He&#39;s posing as an insurance salesman (&#34;Lady, I&#39;m the best insurance you&#39;ve got...&#34;). Other scintillating characters include the captain (John Rhys-Davies, and sadly his dignity is the first victim of the film), his tae-bo instructor daughter (snicker - Tae-bo), an annoying old stuck-up lady with a tiny dog which should be fed to a cat (guess WHAT eats it...?) and an incredibly unpleasant gigolo who might have been believable in a movie made in 1964, not in anything more recent. Much of the acting was really bad, and the characters were just there so that you can laugh hysterically when they died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - SCREAMINGLY bad. Bad on many levels. BAD BAD BAD. What??? Bullets don&#39;t even make Chupacabra flinch, but the Tae-bo bimbo can punch him and scare him away???? Hey Sci-fi Channel, you desperate for scripts or what?

I&#39;m glad that this is available on DVD now. This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content &amp; style over empty-headed flashing lights &amp; constant loud noises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, if you have a short attention span or lack the wit &amp; imagination to engage with literary narrative you won&#39;t like this film. The reasons for this are quite simple, but unfortunately rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs has done a fantastic job of transposing the story of Catherine Storr&#39;s novel &#39;Marianne Dreams&#39; successfully to a screenplay. An unenviable task as anyone who has seen a film of a book will undoubtedly know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The casting is excellent, allowing director Bernard Rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now; they indulge in the craft of acting! I know, I know, actors doing their job &amp; acting instead of resorting to mugging inanely at the camera lens whist a kaleidoscope of car chases, explosions &amp; fire fights break out around them is a genuinely rare treat, but it does actually happen in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to the final reason that this is a film for the imaginative thinker &amp; not the spoon-fed tabloid reader - Apart from a solid script, direction &amp; acting, it relies on atmosphere, suspense &amp; implied horror. If it is to be categorized as horror then the presentation of &#39;Paper House&#39; is more in the vein of Sophocles than Tobe Hooper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion then, if you like lots of loud noises, explosions, constant cuts, &amp; bright flashing colours you&#39;d be better off watching &#39;Transformers&#39;, but if you like a suspenseful story which unfolds through a skillful &amp; evocative use of narrative without insulting your intelligence by force feeding you cacophonous nonsense then this might just be your thing.

Let me depart from many comments I&#39;ve read here, and say that this film ranks as one of the five best Bonds, along with On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service, From Russia With Love, Licence To Kill, and For Your Eyes Only (the ONLY time Roger Moore actually played the role of Bond, instead of futzing around). Of course, Sean Connery pulls the whole thing together -- as co-writer, co-producer, and in his best performance since From Russia With Love. He is fit, energetic, and obviously enjoying himself. His acting is mature, confident, and laced with the right amount of humour. This is in contrast to his mechanical performance in Thunderball, his sleepwalking through You Only Live Twice, and his jowly, paunchy romp through that cartoon known as Diamonds Are Forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an imaginative reworking of Thunderball, without having the sets and machines overwhelming the characters and plot. This cast is far superior, as well. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings his unique style to the role of Largo, without relying on an eyepatch, SPECTRE ring or a boring uniform. Kim Basinger is athletic and lovely, Barbara Carrera is dynamic, and for once, we have a great Felix Leiter in Bernie Casey. The depictions of M and Q are original, and the addition of the bumbling agent Small-Fawcett is fun without lapsing into slapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Irvin Kershner makes good use of his locations (the Bahamas and the French Riviera) without losing sight of his actors. Although close inspection reveals some mediocre special effects and lapses in continuity, Kershner keeps the film moving at a good pace, unlike Thunderball (which even its director, Terence Young, did not like). Obviously fans will miss the gun-barrel trademark and the 007 theme music, but they are, after all, owned by Eon Productions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michel LeGrand may not have composed the most memorable score, but it captures the atmosphere of the locations without being overly intrusive. Not surprisingly, his best moments are in the south of France, with his French love song (at the health spa) being particularly attractive. And tell me, how many really remember the music for Moonraker? I personally would rather forget Man With the Golden Gun and A View To a Kill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eon folks can sneer at this film if they like. (Yes, Octopussy made more money.) At least Connery&#39;s mature 007 didn&#39;t swing through the jungle emitting a Tarzan yell. He did not frolic with a Bengal tiger, nor did he fight off &#34;Indian&#34; snake charmers with a tennis racket. Despite Eon&#39;s desperate efforts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and the late Jack Schwartzman put together a fine film, one that I think Ian Fleming would have appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, however, you would rather see James Bond get kicked in the shins by a dwarf, engage in another tiresome struggle with &#34;Jaws&#34;, jump into bed with Grace Jones, or lead a slapstick firetruck chase through San Francisco, this is NOT the film for you!

This is quite possibly the worst movie of all time. It stars Shaquille O&#39;Neil and is about a rapping genie. Apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece. The movie gets 1 out of 10.

I&#39;m torn about this show. While MOST parts of it I found to be HILARIOUS, other parts of it I found to be stupid and simply shock for shock sake. The off the wall parody of some of the cartoons are brilliant as indeed are a lot of the scenes with the children. However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s clever getting little children to say rude things. It&#39;s not that I think &#34;oh poor children, they&#39;re being exploited&#34; - it&#39;s just that it&#39;s really not clever!! It&#39;s something that ANYONE could do, therefore making it as simple and pointless as making a paper airplane. In order to make this show better they would have to stick to the natural responses from children, which I think can be funnier than the scripted at time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far the funniest part of Wonder Showzen is Clarence, the blue puppet who wonders around the streets talking to and annoying strangers. It&#39;s really funny and it&#39;s mostly improvised. Seeing him in a long scene about the importance of patience test the patience of an EXTREMELY patient man, was by far the funniest scene in my opinion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should watch this show though because all in all it&#39;s very funny, even if it is stupid at times.

Way too many Christian films become centered around the fear of the Judgment, and as a result come across as condescending and indeliberately cheesy. &#34;Second Glance&#34; gets it right. This is a near perfect evangelical tool; it deals with the real reason why so many young people want nothing to do with Christianity. It assures viewers that one must give up their sin--not their fun--to succeed in the Christian lifestyle. &#34;Second Glance&#34; even works as a piece of film-making. The filmmakers obviously were working on a very low budget, but they managed to write a script dynamic enough to divert viewers&#39; attention from this obvious fact. This film brought me to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and thanks to Christian stations everywhere which show it, it surely has impacted more people than just me.

In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans, in the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli the Magnificent (Sean Connery) kidnaps the American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), her son and her daughter. His intention is to get some money and rifles as ransom for them, to fight against the corrupt Sultan of Moroco (Marc Zuber). In times of election, the American President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. However, Raisuli is betrayed and Eden helps him to be released from the prison with the American soldiers. I do not like films about explicit colonialism and lack of respect to the sovereignty of other countries, but `The Lion and the Wind&#39; is indeed a great adventure. The action scenes are very realistic. Candice Bergen, the most beautiful American actress in the 70´s, is wonderful, performing an abducted woman like in the remarkable movie `Soldier Blue&#39;. Sean Connery is perfect, as usual, as an honest and nationalist religious leader. Brian Keith is great as the American president. I do not know much about the Morocco history to analyze whether there is any truth in this story, but this movie is a worthwhile entertainment. In Brazil it is only available on VHS. My vote is eight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): `O Vento e o Leão&#39; (`The Lion and the Wind&#39;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

its too bad that no one knows anything about this movie, and it gets old telling people it&#39;s rap&#39;s version of spinal tap. and you know, im sorry i dont have any better comments, but damnit, go get the movie and watch it, and then make all your friends watch it too, just like im gonna.

What are people on here talking about? I must have seen a different movie than you guys. I was so bored that I walked out of the theater. What is up with this stuff. I only laughed once and not even that hard. Whoever greenlit this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten. I usually always find something I like in a movie, but this is crazy. &#34;Slackers&#34; makes &#34;Not Another Teen Movie&#34; look like a classic. It ranks up there with such trash as &#34;Body Shots&#34;, &#34;Con Air&#34;, and &#34;Conspiracy Theory&#34; as one of the worst of all time. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would be handing out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their apologies, but to my dismay that wasn&#39;t happening. Looks like I will never see that money again or the two hours.

A group of tourists are stranded on Snake Island after an unfortunate accident with their boat. They are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected, it isn&#39;t called Snake Island because it&#39;s just soooooo much fun to say - it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the large snake population, which is just what happens with these poor dumb souls. This is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off screen snake attacks and lousy performances from NOBODY actors. The only somewhat entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene which ain&#39;t anything couldn&#39;t see in a PG13 rated movie, folks. If you are into snake movies than check out SSSSSSS, but don&#39;t torture yourself with this crap.

Strictly a routine, by-the-numbers western (directed by genre-mainstay Andrew V. McLaglen, so is that any wonder?). Army colonel Brian Keith spars with smarmy bandit Dean Martin, who has just kidnapped the colonel&#39;s wife (Honor Blackman, who never found her niche after playing Pussy Galore in &#34;Goldfinger&#34;). Fist-fights, shoot-outs, stagecoach robberies and Denver Pyle in a supporting role...in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Talking in a low monotone throughout, Keith gets to dally with a prostitute (something of a shock after his run on TV&#39;s &#34;Family Affair&#34;), but otherwise this low-rent material wastes Keith&#39;s amiable talents. It&#39;s also bad news for Dino, who doesn&#39;t seem to notice or care. Hack direction, poor writing and several unfunny attempts at lowball humor. * from ****

This charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful &#34;The Legend of Boggy Creek&#34; is a follow-up in name only. Stories abound in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called &#34;Big Bay Ty&#34; that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (a sweetly feisty performance by cute, pigtailed future &#34;Different Strokes&#34; sitcom star Dana Plato) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being. The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry, bear-like, humongous, but very gentle and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the kids&#39; rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Moore&#39;s casual, no-frills direction relates this simple story at a leisurely pace, astutely capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in compellingly exact detail, drawing the assorted country characters with great warmth and affection, and thankfully developing the sentiment in an organic, restrained, unforced manner that never degenerates into sticky-sappy mush. The adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on &#34;Gilligan&#39;s Island&#34;) gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kids&#39; loving working class single mom while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer enjoyably irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol&#39; hayseed curmudgeonly coots. Robert Bethard&#39;s capable, sunny cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its sumptuously tranquil, achingly pure and fragile untouched by civilization splendor. Darrell Deck&#39;s score adeptly blends flesh-crawling synthesizer shudders and jubilant banjo-pluckin&#39; country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew. In addition, this picture warrants special praise for the way it uncannily predicts the 90&#39;s kiddie feature Bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance.

What can i say about a tale such as this? This magical tale has followed me from my early childhood,evoking warm memories in my heart.The characters take you to to so many whimsical places making you want more of each scene. For example in the market there were so many different flavors of lore. I loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story line was wonderful.I wanted so badly for Landsbury to decide to keep the precocious children and for her to also stay with Mr.Brown,and find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still a child inside,and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other. This movie is my definite favorite of all times. I hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away,and transported into another time.

(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby &#34;B&#34; Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn&#39;t been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn&#39;t been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn&#39;t go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby&#39;s friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to. To satisfy their parents, Bartleby comes up with an idea to start his own college with an internet site. They convert an abandoned psychiatric facility into the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. However, the web site states that we accept anyone. On the first day of school, they unexpectedly have a large number of accepted students that were also rejected by all colleges. With a million dollars in tuition money, Bartleby must make his fake college into a functioning one. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as the College Dean. The fun begins when they design their own curriculum, make their own rules, and party all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My Comment) The premise of starting a college without a teaching staff is a little off the wall. Since it was a fake college, Bartleby really didn&#39;t need a staff. The movie reminded me of the classic movie &#34;Animal House&#34;, the college setting, the fraternity, lots of gags, and pretty young women. These new college freshmen had a different notion of what the college experience was all about. The movie not only has lots of humor, it also has a good message for life. People should reach for their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not settle for what other people want them to do. The ending was a little unrealistic, but it is only a movie. The movie was made for the young crowd to have a little fun. (Universal Pictures, Run time 1:32, Rated PG-13) (7/10)

[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Timon and Pumbaa are watching The Lion King. Timon decides to go back BEFORE the beginning, to when the story really began. So they go back. Way back. Back even before Simba was born. Back to Timon&#39;s old home which was miles away from Pride Rock. A clan of meerkats burrowed underground to hide from hyenas. The worst digger in the clan was a pompous, self-centered meerkat named Timon. His mother took pity on him but Uncle Max just shook his head. Mother suggested putting Timon on sentry duty; Timon had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere. Just then, hyenas Shenzi, Bonzai and Ed arrived and nearly killed poor Uncle Max. That did it. The other meerkats just wanted Timon to go away while Timon took it upon himself to leave. So he kissed his mom goodbye and started off. He didn&#39;t get very far before he started getting homesick. Just then he met Rafiki, who taught him to look beyond what he sees. Timon had no clue what that meant so he continued on and met a warthog named Pumbaa, who was all alone due to a flatulence problem. Timon and Pumbaa join up then, but Timon declared them acquaintances, rather than friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They soon arrive at Pride Rock where all the zebras, antelopes, wildebeests, rhinoceroses, giraffe&#39;s, elephants and many other plain animals had gathered. What was going on? Timon didn&#39;t care. They pressed on. Timon then saw Rafiki atop Pride Rock lifting into the air something he couldn&#39;t see. Just then all the animals took a bow. Was this to honor the birth of the new king? No, Pumbaa had passed gas and the animals were bowing to cover their noses; Timon and Pumbaa try an assortment of new homes, but each are discomforting due to incessant singing or hyenas or a large stampede of wildebeests! Pumbaa and Timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream. When they reach land, Timon decides to give up. But then they gaze around at their newfound paradise. It was beautiful: trees and water falls as far as the eye could see. Timon named the place after a strange phrase he learned from Rafiki: Hakuna Matata. Timon and Pumbaa go out bowling for buzzards one afternoon when they suddenly run into Simba. They take him under their wing and become father figures. They teach him the arts of bug eating and belching contests. Pretty soon, a teenage Simba takes on Timon in a snail slurping contest. Simba won, leaving Timon deathly ill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Then one day, Simba&#39;s childhood friend Nala arrived. Timon and Pumbaa just knew she&#39;d break up the friendship. Suddenly, Simba runs away. Nala and Pumbaa race after him, but not Timon. He chose to stay at &#34;Hakuna Matata&#34; by himself, until Rafiki &#34;talked&#34; some sense into him, so he joins his friends at Pride Rock. Timon&#39;s mother and Uncle Max arrive then. While Simba battles Scar, Mother and Max dig a large hole to trap hyenas Shenzi, Bonzai and Ed in. It worked. Scar is soon flung down the same hole where he is devoured by the hyenas. Then all is well. Mother, Uncle Max and the rest of the meerkats go live with Timon and Pumbaa in the paradise that is Hakuna Matata. Back to the present, Timon and Pumbaa finish the movie when suddenly Mother, Uncle Max, Simba and Rafiki want to watch it again. So do Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Snow White, the Seven Dwarfs, Dumbo, Peter Pan, the Lost Boys, Mad Hatter, March Hare, Genie, Aladdin, and Jasmine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well, I must say that The Lion King 1 1/2 wasn&#39;t as good as I had hoped. It was too ridiculous and silly. The original Lion King was a masterpiece. It had a serious story with light comedy thrown in. This one was just silly and made a mockery of it. I swear, sometimes Timon and Pumbaa are just way too overplayed. They&#39;re overplayed to the point of no longer being funny, just annoying. The original voice cast is back: Nathan Lane as Timon, Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa, Matthew Broddrick as Adult Simba, Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi, Cheech Marin as Bonzai, Jim Cummings as Ed, Robert Guillame as Rafiki. New to the cast are Julie Kavner of TV&#39;s (Too) long running series The Simpsons as Timon&#39;s mom and Jerry Stiller as Uncle Max. So anyway, this movie isn&#39;t The Lion King III, and it isn&#39;t II because there already is a II. It takes place right after Part I and Part II is a ways away. Hence, it&#39;s 1 1/2. In conclusion, I don&#39;t recommend this to die hard Lion King fans because it&#39;s far too ridiculous and frivilous. However the kids will love it so I recommend it to them. I hope this will also be the LAST Lion King movie. Two is enough. &#34;The Lion King 1 1/2&#34;. What we&#39;ve come to expect from Disney sequel makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-

When I was 17 my high school staged Bye Bye Birdie - which is no great surprise, since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the most-staged musical in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs, as well as a lingering disregard for the Dick Van Dyke movie version which had (deliberately) obscured the Elvis references and camped it up for a swinging 60s audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when the 1995 version starring Jason Alexander hit my cable TV screen, I was delighted with what I saw. Alexander turns in an exceptional performance as Albert, a performance in strong contrast to his better-known persona from a certain TV series. The remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part, supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But best of all, the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be (allowing for the absence of a stage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you know the musical (and few do not), then check out this telemovie. It does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered, which is good enough for me. What is better than rendering a writer&#39;s work faithfully and with colour and style?

When the first trailer for this film was viewed by myself, I was curious as to what angle the storyline would take. After all the plot of having one&#39;s childhood self return to the present leaves open many options. Bruce Willis however does a superb job in the role he was given. I was surprised to see just how well he could act in this part. This is also a good career move as many others have said but after seeing it I now agree. This film is mainly about remembering the kid you used to be, and coming to the realization that you aren&#39;t the adult you planned to be. This is a wonderful story and a gripping tale that makes us all think. Usually we scorn at &#34;What if...&#34; movies. For example, Waterworld attempted to answer the question &#34;What if the world were to be covered with water and...?&#34; But truthfully, nobody cared. This movie however effects everyone in the theatre. True, young children may not fully grasp the idea of growing up and having all your dreams fizzle away, but it leaves a great impact on the adults and parents of those children. This movie is definitely worth seeing. Although, it will be better the second time around because you won&#39;t be thinking so much (about how the kid got there, and why and all that stuff) Just relax and have fun. And take something with you when you leave that cinema. Take that piece of your childhood you&#39;ve forgotten and enjoy it.

To confess having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty tough admission for an heterosexual to make. But what can I tell you? Maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star. It crosses that barrier. It pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory. Brando had it in spades, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean of course and in more recent times, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very very recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt has, singlehandedly, redefined the concept. He is the only reason to go out, get in the car, find parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and get into a theatre to see &#34;Troy&#34; If you liked epics in the &#34;Jupiter&#39;s Darling&#34; style you may enjoy this. But if you don&#39;t, go all the same, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.

The prey has an interesting history, unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in June of 1984 you might have caught it on the Movie channel back in summer 85, but little else is remembered. The plot is your basic killer in the woods again. But ironically this was filmed before Friday the 13th. The prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later. But released for about a week at some drive ins, (yes Jim, namans drive in showed this in June of 84). But it has a dated look to it. Maybe they released it so later on to cash in on all the other terror films the market was flooded with by 1984. Now on the story, it has some kind of back story, a forest fire back in the 1940&#39;s leaves a lot of Gypsies burned to death. But one of their children survive (our monster) so flash forward to present day which would be 1978, we have an older middle age couple camping only to be dispatched by the Monster. The tag line for this picture claims ITS NOT HUMAN, AND ITS GOT AN AXE, but an Axe was only used in these first two killings. Now we have a bunch of teenagers who look like they in their mid 20&#39;s camping. We all know they are the Prey, and the monster knocks them of one by one. For an 80 minute movie it seems longer. We also have a lot of wildlife footage to fill in voids for the 80 mins. Overall for being out into an 80-&#39;s horror movie it looks way more 70&#39;s than ever. Hey the Prey had potential to be a good horror killer in the woods movie but falls a little short.. It does however feature a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end, and we have to wait till the last 2 minutes to see him. Side note, the monster has gone on to star in the Addams family movies in the 1990&#39;s..

For a film made in Senegal, based, I guess loosely on Carmen, the book, by Prosper Merimee, this film doesn&#39;t achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Gai as the Karmen of the title is very good to look at. Her fiery dancing smolders the screen, as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Karmen that aims to please to all genders, but a real Carmen, she is not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would like to see Ms. Gai in other films in which her talent is better used than here.

haggard doesn&#39;t even need to be graded, since it was never designed to be graded like Oscar-winning movies are and it was never intended to have won an Oscar (obviously). if you just look at some of the stuff that Bam and Bran tried, like the fast-motion shots, it comes across as a film thats something more than just cky or jackass (even though those are cool too). For pure enjoyability i definitely give this film a 10; almost every scene made me laugh until my sides hurt, like falcone&#39;s trail movie. If you haven&#39;t seen this, see it and then buy it. Personally my favorite character is brandon (falcone), he&#39;s just so smooth and natural and random that its hilarious, he freestyles great (with the action figures) and makes up the funniest stuff- lol a diamond mountain bike? haggard is definitely a movie that in overall humor is only rivaled by anchorman and napoleon dynamite.

I absolutely could not believe the levels of ineptitude on display in this production. I honestly thought gay men had better taste than this. I know I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulk of the blame doesn&#39;t lie with the cast, but let&#39;s get them out of the way first...the only one with real talent was Joe Souza (plus he had the best bod in the cast). He had a nice, clear theatre-style voice. Okay, and Jaymes Hodges&#39; voice was so-so, but he had a vacant expression in every number. The rest couldn&#39;t hold a note in a bucket, even though the music was obviously dubbed in after the fact. Must have been really dreadful hearing them live. They were also all girly-boys except for maybe three. If I wanted to see naked WOMEN onstage I could go to the titty bars. Not sure why anyone would choose to film the L.A. production instead of New York. I would imagine NY has more readily available singing talent, though one would think in L.A. they would be able to find better-LOOKING guys. Apparently not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I digress...the real blame here lies with the creators and producers. This score was the most banal, insipid tripe I have ever heard. It sounded like some theatre queens took all their musical cd&#39;s, threw them in a blender and poured the goo onto a page. Sadly, I&#39;m sure there are many who can&#39;t tell the difference between good theatre writing and whatever this is. I mean seriously, I was laughing my ass off through the whole thing but not at the lame jokes. I think the morbid &#39;my-lover-has-died-of-AIDS-song&#39; entitled &#34;Kris, Look What You&#39;ve Missed&#34; was the most hysterical thing in the whole show. Genius writing...Kris / Missed...wow...they ALMOST rhyme...must be a good lyric. And Jesus...the END of that song...&#34;Oh Kris, Ohhh Kris, OHHHH Kris...&#34; OVER AND OVER!!! My other favorite was &#34;You gotta be a Pumpy Junkie Boy to be a Humpy Hunkie Boy&#34;...WTF??? The whole show was full of the most arbitrary lyrics JUST BECAUSE they rhymed. Where did these people learn to write songs? Apparently they listened to Sondheim and said &#34;He&#39;s not so great, I can do that&#34;...as evidenced by the retarded &#34;Bobby, Bobby, Bobby&#34; reference from COMPANY in one song. Another irk: why are 20-somethings singing about Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter? Obviously coming from the mouths of the lyricists and not the actors...again, bad writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love torture and pain, and I know many of you strange fetishists do, go ahead and watch it. But you&#39;ve been warned.

The director, outfitted in chains and leather, warned the audience at the SF Frameline Film Festival Friday night that we were about to see an &#34;experiental&#34; film. Experimental? Leave the video camera on the back seat of the car, let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight. A meandering pastiche road show manqué that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place. The gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the Castro theater. I would have left, too, but my cine-buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end. By the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably. Tepid applause. Pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product. Avoid this film!

Laurence Fishburne is a fine actor, and deserves respect for trying this, but he is not in a class with the great Shakespeareans like Olivier and Welles; and he further suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, always brilliant, cleanly steals the show away. Olivier recognized that potential in his production, and cast Iago with someone he knew he could upstage. I didn&#39;t nearly realize the possibilities of Iago, Shakespeare&#39;s most evil character, but Branagh shows us the depths. Nice to see the views of Venice, too.

8 points for take on probably what really kinda maybe more what it was like back then. American Indians probably stole more than killed. Who really knows? Nice slower odd pursuit means it has a pace and... interesting and unique. Thankfully not another mindless shoot em up. I thought this would suck at first, I wound up getting wrapped up... nice treasure... good job! I have hopes nobody dissects this film. When the entire movie unfolds you have many unique twists, impossible to determine what will be next. The characters are human and have either honor or not... passion or not... forgiveness or not. Wound up loving the White Horse, the Indian, Sheen even the damned desert. All good.

i was intrigued to see how a little-seen 2008 film had somehow won the Oscar for best picture of 2009 and thus went to see The Hurt Locker. sadly, all i got for the two hours invested was the grim confirmation that this film had won awards purely for off-the-screen reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the direction and visual style of this film is some of the weakest you will ever see. when it&#39;s not busy being yet another Bourne Identity homage with dire, annoying &#34;shaky cam&#34; visuals, it shows off all the hallmarks of a second rate daytime soap opera in terms of lensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the &#34;plot&#34; is threadbare, the characterizations are about as well developed as rejected Beetle Bailey comic strip ideas and the dialogue - on the instances where the film gives up on being &#34;minimalist&#34; and for no apparent reason turns one or two soldiers into right chatterboxes - is some of the worst ever recorded. in fairness, the actors do the best they can in the circumstances, just not enough to obscure how bad the project is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the whole film has the feel of it being intended as some kind of &#34;mockumentary&#34; that they clocked was bereft of humour and thus re-edited as best they could so as to pass it off as a serious drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you spend two hours on this film they are two hours you will never get back, and two hours wasted that you will regret for the rest of your life.

Only Connery could bring that particular style with a line like that Fatima crashes into Bond&#39;s arms when she water-skis up to the super agent in Nassau and apologizes, &#39;Oh, how reckless of me. I made you all wet.&#39; The super agent replies, &#39;Yes, but my martini is still dry.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Carrera makes a great villain, stealing the show as SPECTRE executioner Fatima Blush Fatima is number 12 in the SPECTRE chain of command, and is a gorgeous assassin who takes intense sensations of pleasure in killing &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fatima assumes all the deadly characteristics of Fiona, proving to be one of Bond&#39;s toughest adversaries She is a victim of her vanity She&#39;s good at what she does, and wants the world to know it But her vanity is her downfall Using every possible approach to eliminate 007, Fatima is a wild and cunning woman who makes love to the man she is about to kill &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Austrian actor Klaus-María Brandauer (Largo) does not make a very formidable opponent for 007 Referred to as number one in the SPECTRE chain of command, Largo resides in the Bahamas, and travels aboard his super yacht, the Flying Saucer &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Von Sydow becomes the fourth actor to appear as SPECTRE chief Ernst Stavro Blofeld, once more plotting to put the world at ransom &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kim Basinger takes the part once owned by the lovely French actress Claudine Auger She is Domino, the mistress of Largo, who soon falls deeply in love with her rescuer &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black actor Bernie Casey becomes the sixth actor to play CIA agent Felix Leiter after Jack Lord, Cec Linder, Rik Van Nutter, Norman Burton, and David Hedison...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edward Fox portrays the new, unsympathetic &#39;M.&#39; Pamela Salem is the third actress to play Miss Moneypenny. Lois Maxwell was the first and Barbara Bouchet was the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valerie Leon is the sexy lady in the Bahamas who fished 007 out of the blue water and saved his life by making love to him in her own room Valerie was the Sardinian hotel receptionist in &#39;The Spy Who loved Me&#39; when Bond and Anya arrive seeking Stromberg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prunella Gee is Shrublands physical therapist Patricia Saskia Cohen Tanugi is Nicole, Bond&#39;s Secret Service contact in the South of France &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gavan O&#39;Herlihy is Jack Petachi, the U.S. Air Force communications officer who duplicates the President of the United States&#39; &#39;eye print&#39; and arms two cruise missiles with nuclear warheads &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rowan Atkinson is the bumbling foreign officer Nigel Small-Fawcett; and Alec McCowen is Algernon, the armorer who provides 007 some formidable items &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to see Connery playing a tense battle of wills, disguised as a masseur, attacked by robot-controlled sharks, giving away a considerable amount of money for a tango dance, thrown into a medieval dungeon, don&#39;t miss this second of only two &#34;unofficial&#34; James Bond films

I have watched this movie time and time and time again - each time it makes me laugh, it makes me think, and it makes me cry. Robin Tuney does an incredible job of portraying Marcy (and I&#39;m kind of glad that Kate Winslet and that other lady turned down her part) its just one of those rolls that you know that no one else could have even compared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a beautiful love story of these 2 very different people in crappy situations that team up together. They stand beside each other no matter what, even if it is in an odd situation and crazy ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll tell you now its not for everyone - out of everyone I&#39;ve shown it to I&#39;d say the results are 50/50 - but if you like it, you&#39;ll love it and want to share it with others! 10 stars all the way!

Kimi wa petto is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is outside her apartment one day. She decides to bring him in and fix his cuts. She then leaves a note for him to eats some food she made then go home because she had to go to work. When she gets home however she finds that he is still there. He tells her that he wants to live there with her like a brother or cousin. In desperation to get him to leave she tells him that if he became her pet then he could stay. And as a pet she says that he would have no rights and do whatever she told him. (not in that perverted way!) To her surprise he agrees and from then on he is known as Momo, her pet.

In the year 2000 (keep in mind, this is two years ago, not four), two men had the motivation to create the most miraculous piece of art on this side of the Mississippi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now enjoy Second String, a delicious TV movie depicting a tale of a rag-tag gang of second stringers (thus the title) who are thrust into the position of starters due to an order of bad oysters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the motivational direction of both the director Robert Lieberman and the Buffalo Bills&#39; last minute QB, Dan &#34;Give &#39;em hell&#34; Heller (portrayed by Canadian actor, Gil Bellows) the oft Super Bowl snake-bitten Bills find themselves in the ultimate position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict, a love story, comraderie that only the fine sport of football can bring, and an overall theory that the underdog can compete, Second String is an excellent movie worthy of viewing every possible moment that it appears on TNT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing potentially bad about this production is the spelling of the Costume Designer&#39;s first name, Jenifur Jarvis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I really wanted to like this movie, because I love Troma and loved the trailer and loved &#34;Ghouls,&#34; another of Ferrin&#39;s films. It did have some almost-good moments, like the oldies love song playing over the car crash scene, and a scene near the end where the protagonist gets some closure. But on the whole, it was just boring and mildly unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;unimaginable&#34; shocks that Ferrin came up with were really predictable and worn-out. Poop, murdering prostitutes, incest. Could have still been good, but poorly done. Unsure whether it was trying to offend, amuse, or both. Ultimately did neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN conclusion, we watch Troma movies because we want films with heart. This film did not consistently feel like it had heart. There were some good scenes, but ultimately it was dull and unpleasant.

Request you to not watch this movie... It starts with a promise and as it goes on you crave for the movie to end... Predictable,not entertaining at all,wasted movie... Save your time and watch better thrillers.... The synopsis sounds good and that is why I watched the movie... But it was way too predictable with nothing to give you a start... No great suspense.. no great direction... nothing phenomenal with the acting... shy away from this... low rating... Nothing to write about this movie so I am filling up the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much a time waster this movie is...really irritated at how good a premise that was and how bad a screenplay was written out of it...

Truly flatulent script, and I was very disappointed with Marc Singer for agreeing to be in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually walked out of the theater about 15-20 minutes into it, and demanded my money back. I have actually walked out of a movie only 3 times in my life (I am 43 years old) and this is the only one that made me mad enough to demand my ticket price back. If I could have, I would have gotten a refund on the popcorn, too. This was a truly lousy movie, and there is no excuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one thing, how does someone who was raised as a pre-tech barbarian learn to DRIVE A CAR? IN California!!!? (Driving a car is a somewhat tricky skill, and in California, even tricker...I should know, I live there.)

Rugged David Innes (solid Doug McClure) and doddery Dr. Abner Perry (a delightfully dotty Peter Cushing) drill their way into the earth&#39;s core in their spiffy mole machine. The duo discover an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous gigantic beasts and human beings who are used as both food and slaves by evil telepathic pterodactyl men. Director Kevin Conner, working from a blithely silly script by Milton Subotsky, maintains a constant brisk pace throughout and treats the exceptionally foolish premise with astonishing seriousness, thereby giving this picture a certain clunkily earnest quality that&#39;s amusing and endearing in equal measure. The lovably hokey (not so) special effects are quite (unintentionally) funny. The cheesy array of cut-price creatures in particular are positively sidesplitting: cruddy guys-in-obvious-shoddy-rubber-suits pterodactyl men, equally rinky-dink savage ape-man brutes, and a hilariously ludicrous fire-belching frog thing who blows up real good. One gut-busting highlight occurs when McClure mixes it up with a fat and clumsy giant reptile. Another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur clutching a doll in its slavering jaws. Moreover, we also get some rousing rough&#39;n&#39;ready fisticuffs and an exciting climactic slave revolt. It&#39;s a total treat to see Cushing gleefully ham it up in a rare broad comedic part and become an unlikely, but enthusiastic arrow-slinging action hero in the last third of the flick. The ever-luscious Caroline Munro looks positively yummy as the fetching Princess Dia, plus there are nice supporting turns by Cy Grant as gallant warrior Ra and Sean Lynch as treacherous coward Hoojah. Mike Vickers&#39; neatly varied score alternates between jaunty orchestral music and wonky droning synthesizer stuff. Alan Hume&#39;s crisp cinematography adds a glossy sheen to the infectiously inane proceedings. A complete campy riot.

A long time ago, way back in the early &#39;80s, a late-night TV show &#34;Fridays&#34; came to ABC, trying to steal the limelight away from NBC&#39;s badly-listing &#34;Saturday Night Live&#34;. It didn&#39;t but it did introduce some repugnant sketches and semi-talented &#34;comedians&#34; to the world. Like Mark Blankenfield, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which, in a roundabout way, brings us to &#34;Jekyll and Hyde... Together Again&#34;. Which is repugnant in ways all its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blankenfield is about as subtle as a pew full of whoopee cushions going off after Communion. And about as tasteful, too. This is just his drugged-out druggist character he played on the ill-fated &#34;Fridays&#34; show stretched out to feature length. And if you didn&#39;t like him there, why are you reading this review?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie, that&#39;s a bad sign. Then when it goes for dunder-headed jokes that would get you thrown off every improv stage in the Western hemisphere and replaces gags with gross-out, things can only get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A comic take on a Robert Louis Stevenson story? About as good an idea as making a sitcom out of Poe&#39;s &#34;Fall of the House of Usher&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from a few (VERY few) gags that give a slight grin, this whole film is an exercise in waste - wasted actors, wasted film, wasted opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wonder they showed original author Stevenson turning in his grave. What more observant a review could they give themselves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No stars. No, not even for Armstrong, who should have known better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Hyde&#34; from this one.

This may be all you need to know in order to decide whether you want to see this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is bad. Really, really bad. And sometimes it seems to be aware of that and make fun of how bad it is. It aligns cliche after cliche and even manages to grow worse as it goes along with some moments that are bad enough to be hilariously funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can laugh about really poor quality in script writing and production values, you might enjoy it. Otherwise prepare for some serious brain damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10

&#34;Kolchak: the Night Stalker&#34; is a hugely entertaining TV series in which a pushy, sarcastic, forty-something reporter is repeatedly drawn into mortal combat with supernatural (and occasionally extraterrestrial) forces. Based on a very popular pair of TV movies featuring the Kolchak character, this series died a quick death in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but it nevertheless maintains a strong cult following today. But will the average modern-day viewer be able to dig Kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s actually a tough question to answer fairly. Detractors of this series tend to argue that it&#39;s formulaic and hopelessly dated. On the other hand, fans argue that it&#39;s cleverly written, well-acted, and sometimes genuinely spooky. And me? I&#39;ve got a foot in both camps. I thoroughly enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of Kolchak on DVD recently, though I can plainly see that the series has major flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll address the question of Kolchak being &#34;formula&#34; fiction first. Now, I think we can all agree that most TV shows have formulas - just about every episode of Columbo unfolds according to the same pattern, for example. Repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself; in fact, critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy, and actively seek out, repetitive entertainment. However, the problem with Kolchak is that its formula is simply TOO rigid - it&#39;s too repetitive even by the most generous standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In almost every episode, Kolchak investigates a murder, and figures out that it was committed by some form of monster. He tries to publish a story about said monster, but his editor Vincenzo blocks him, always on the grounds that Kolchak doesn&#39;t have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work. And, alas, Kolchak is also obstructed by the police. So, in the end, Kolchak does some independent research on the monster, figures out how to kill it... and then kills it. Without ceremony, or reward, or writing a big story about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see where this ever-so-strict formula might get tiresome, right? I&#39;m particularly mystified by Vincenzo - if Kolchak&#39;s always raving about monsters, and Vincenzo never believes it... well, then, why doesn&#39;t Vincenzo fire Kolchak, or have him committed? That&#39;s what any normal boss would do. But the series eschews such realism and prefers to keep Vincenzo and Kolchak as comical antagonists. As a result, many of their scenes together are profoundly unbelievable - though they are also quite funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very best episodes of Kolchak manage to vault over the limitations of this formula, however, usually because they contain some kind of unexpected twist. These select episodes are good enough that I think they&#39;re largely immune to typical criticisms of the series. Some of my favorites include: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horror in the Heights - an episode that&#39;s noteworthy for being grimy, inventive and socially aware. Kolchak&#39;s dialog has an unusually sharp and cynical edge. Though it adheres closely to the Kolchak formula, the script (written by Hammer Studios veteran Jimmy Sangster) is remarkably literate, and it delves deeply into the monster&#39;s backstory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Devil&#39;s Platform - a possible inspiration for the &#34;Omen&#34; films, this episode stands out to me because the villain - a very young Tom Skerritt - tempts Kolchak with a satanic contract full of goodies (and, in so doing, reveals a lot about the reporter&#39;s character.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firefall - this episode appears to have a bad reputation among fans, but I enjoyed it because it&#39;s got a great red herring and a really creepy, almost unstoppable-seeming monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I&#39;ve singled out these three episodes for praise, I&#39;d say that most of the stories are entertaining at the very least. For my money, there are only two complete turkeys in the 20-episode run: Primal Scream, which is about monkey-men running rampant in Chicago, and the Sentry, which features the dumbest-looking creature makeup in the history of filmed entertainment (and this assessment is coming from a lifelong Doctor Who and Godzilla fan!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On balance, then, this is a good series. A little repetitive, a little cheesy perhaps, but it has elements of greatness. Even during the weaker episodes, Darren McGavin&#39;s wonderful performance as the caustic, world-weary, endlessly funny Kolchak truly shines. He carries the series effortlessly, in a way that, for example, Sarah Michelle Gellar never managed on &#34;Buffy.&#34; McGavin was one great character actor, and this series is worth watching for him alone.

Anand is one of those low-budget but well taken movies. It&#39;s a &#34;cup of coffee&#34; entertainment, with no violence, blood or &#34;jump out of your seat&#34; excitement which most telugu films have. However, it does have some massala of it&#39;s own. Roopa is a headstrong and down-to-earth young woman who is not afraid to confront any sort of situation, even her offensive mother-in-law&#39;s distaste for her. She even backs out of the wedding because her fiancé doesn&#39;t stand up for her. However, her air of confidence and independence is enough to make Anand, a rich young gentleman living in the city, aspire to be her new husband. His father accidentally kills her parents in a car crash anyways, so why not pay her back? But Roopa is not the kind who will fall for charming smiles and polite behavior, she puts him through a bunch of situations, continuing to be rude and a pain. It&#39;s not until he stands up for her and saves her life that she understands she loves him too. But complications ensue

Scarecrows is one of those films that, with a little more acting, a little more direction, and a lot more story logic, would have been quite compelling as a horror entry. As it stands, it is still a creepy film that has solid make-up and gore effects, and a premise that sustains the mood of terror in spite of itself. And hey, there are no teenagers getting killed one by one--just dumb adults, so that is a refreshing change of pace. And the plot line is amazingly similar to Dead Birds, with a precipitating robbery, an abandoned spooky house in the middle of nowhere, and demonic monsters. But just like Dead Birds, the adults are still witless, they run around cluelessly before getting slaughtered one by one, and they ignore the obvious danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Scarecrows, though, we never really find out the supernatural why, and that sustains the atmosphere of creepiness. And like clowns, scarecrows can be very creepy; unless they look like Ray Bolger, of course. Escaping in a hijacked plane with the pilot and his daughter, after a robbery netting millions, a para-military bunch is double-crossed by one of their own; a very nervous guy named Burt. He jumps out of the plane with the big, and heavy, box that holds the money with apparently no plans as to how to move it around once he is on the ground. Being the dumbest of the bunch, he is murdered first. But not before he happens upon the Fowler residence, nestled snuggly amid lots of really creepy-looking scarecrows, and surrounded with a wooden fence encircled with barbed-wire and lots of warnings to stay away. And the weird weathervane on the roof, with the pitchfork and pterodactyl, should have been a warning sign, too. The inside of the house is also quite foreboding (to us in the audience, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annoyingly, we must listen to Burt&#39;s thoughts in voice-over, as he walks around and mysteriously comes across the key to the decrepit truck in the yard. The way the key pops up would be enough to have my pants--with me in them--flying out the door. Perhaps it&#39;s just me, but I really enjoy watching people&#39;s lips move on screen, even when they are just thinking out loud. It helps to intensify the action, and gives the actor more to do than just look like what the voice-over is saying. Burt hoists the box onto the truck and makes his getaway. Sure why not? decrepit trucks always have lots of gas in them, especially with today&#39;s prices, and the battery? no problem. Now, I did mention that Burt was the dumbest of the bunch, and here is why (in addition to the above, of course). Wearing night-vision goggles to walk through the foliage and find the house, he takes them off to drive the truck away, and instead, turns on the headlights to see where he is going. Of course, the crooks still in the plane spot the headlights of his truck, and know where he is headed. Brilliant. He deserves to die. Definitely. I am not sure why he needed night vision goggles in the first place, as every scene is brightly lit, from the interior of the plane, to the night-time outside scenery, and the house. The cinematographer was either a. myopic, b. just out of school, or c. dealing with really cheap filmstock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt meets his demise when the truck dies in the middle of nowhere. Go figure. One very nice touch, and there are, I must admit, a few in the film, is the fact that when he opens the truck&#39;s lid, there is no engine. Creepy, to be sure (and insert pants comment again here). The story logic fails when dead, now-stuffed-like-a-flounder-with-money-and-straw-Burt returns to the house. The rest of the bunch are there, rough him up, then realize that he is indeed dead, and was gutted and stuffed like a flounder with money and straw. Dead Burt does manage to put up quite a fight, though, and grabs one fellow by the mouth, pushing him through a window, causing him to bite off more than he could chew in a gorylicious scene. At this point, you would think they&#39;d would be racing out of the house and back to the plane--but noooo, they decide to stay and look for the rest of the money. In fact, the whole Burt is dead episode is treated rather matter-of-factly, although one bright bulb in the bunch does argue, &#34;Burt was walking around dead, for chrissakes!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stolen money suddenly appears on the grounds outside the house, and the crooks blithely go for the bait. Soon, another one of them, Jack, is dispatched, and again the scene is well done and horrific, involving a dull handsaw and no anethesia. Now there are three scarecrows going about wreaking mayhem, and one of them needs a hand, literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When one of the crooks sees the scarecrows and Jack getting scarecrow-ized, he starts screaming, running away like hell, and shooting off his gun in typical para-military fashion. So much for all that training under pressure crap. He meets up with the others and stops in his tracks to explain why he is screaming, running away like hell, and shooting off his gun, even though the scarecrows appear to be chasing him. Again, that script logic thing... Dead and gutted, Jack returns to the house, and goes after the screamer with the usual results. If you listen to Jack&#39;s demonic growl, by the way, you may notice, depending on your age, that it is the same monster-growling sound heard often in the Lost In Space TV episodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two survivors race away from the house and back to the plane, barely escaping. But do they? You will have to see the film to find out.

If this is supposed to be a portrayal of the American serial killer, it comes across as decidedly average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A journalist [Duchovny] travels across country to California to document America&#39;s most famous murderers, unaware that one of his white trailer trash travelling companions [Pitt] is a serial killer himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather predictable throughout, this has its moments of action and Pitt and Lewis portray their roles well, but I&#39;d not bother to see it again.

I am sad to say that I disagree with other people on this Columbo episode. Death Lends a Hand is frankly kind of a boring Columbo to me. After a few times, I get bored and changed the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland&#39;s character. He hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she is having an affair. In return, Culp&#39;s character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career. Out of anger, Culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere. I don&#39;t know. Maybe I just didn&#39;t care for this one at all. Of course, Columbo gets him in the end. It&#39;s just the question of how.

If you played &#34;Spider-Man&#34; on the PS version, then you&#39;ve seen it all. To truly experience it you should get the DC version. Simply put it&#39;s a much graphically superior game; the textures are sharp, levels are easy to navigate, and it has much better sound then it&#39;s PS cousin. I bought this game back in late &#39;00s and it still holds up even till this day. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a much superior and strategic game but if you&#39;re a fan of &#39;ol Web Head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library. Swinging around the city as Spidey has never looked this good and dead-on in a video game. If you have a Dreamcast, snag this up for cheap. The DC version is simply incredible.

Many people are making fun out of Steven Seagals acting abilities. And I really see why if I remember Fire Down Below. Well...ok his other films are acceptable (regarding to his acting!). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews about The Patriot I didn&#39;t expect anything from this film. I barely came through Fire Down Below and I read a lot that The Patriot was even worse. So I was really surprised about this one. In my opinion it is one of his very best movies. If it had have more action sequences and a couple more fighting scenes it would be THE best. I liked the story the directing and the actors. Cammilla Belle was just incredible. She will have a great movie-career in the future. The few action scenes were very well made. And Steven Seagal was very believable in his unusual role.

Lonesome Dove is my favorite western second only to The Searchers with John Wayne. I watch Lonesome Dove about every 6 months and never get tired of it. I have read all the LD books, although I cannot remember much of Comanche Moon. I too looked forward to this mini-series and decided to tape it on our DVR so we could fast forward through commercials. Unfortunately, I messed up and didn&#39;t record the first part, but decided to watch the other parts and try to pick up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nobody that can ever compete with Robert Duvall or Tommy Lee Jones, and I was expecting to be disappointed and I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there were so many things that didn&#39;t ring true, the most apparent to me was when Nellie died the day before and Gus was out on the range, it switched over to Clara writing him a letter from Nebraska telling him how sorry she was to hear of her death. How in the world could she have known the next day way out in Nebraska? Additionally, it was supposed to be 7 years later after her leaving and her children looked to be about 6-7 years old, maybe a little younger, yet more time went on before they actually moved to Lonesome Dove, and in Lonesome Dove they had been there about 10 years or longer before leaving to Montana. When they stopped at Clara&#39;s in Nebraska, which probably took another 6 months on the trail, the girls looked to be about 10-13, since they were playing in the yard like little children. The math just does not add up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that the man who played Gus had a lot of his mannerisms and looked a little like Gus may have looked as a young man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also a little confused about one thing. The captive white girl that they brought back - was she the one they captured when they raided Austin? They said she had been captured 25 years ago, but if she was the one captured in Austin, it was only 7 years later when this took place in the movie. Was she captured earlier? I remember seeing a captive girl after they raided the town and don&#39;t know if this is the same one. If someone can explain since I missed Part 1. If it had been 25 years, she would probably be over 40 years old when they found her since she looked to be grown lying on the ground. Also, the way they were ravaging her when they captured her, it is hard to believe she would have lived to go on to be married and having Indian children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit though, nothing is worse than John Voight playing Call in the sequel to Lonesome Dove or the unbelievable marriage of Lorena to Pea Eye in the McMurty sequel to Lonesome Dove, which was never explained either. Also, the way he killed Newt off was I hear from spite for them doing the sequel with John Voight without his approval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone can clear up these discrepancies, I would appreciate.

Wow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up at the local Wal-Mart after reading online that it had been released early. I&#39;ve been following this online for some time, and just had to buy the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the thing that really struck me was the editing, or lack thereof. Time and again, characters (usually The Narrator and whoever he is with) are shown walking...and walking...and walking. I am not an editor, but I do know that you can cut between someone leaving point A to show them arriving at point B. There is no need to show almost the entire journey! Wow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this. They seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy, depending on what action was to be added at a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why it was decided to do almost all the effects using CG is beyond me. Even ILM still employs miniatures sometimes. One of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of (according to the end credits) the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities, including London. At times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera. In one shot in London, there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator&#39;s brother (played by star Anthony Piana without his distracting mustache). Not since GETTYSBURG have I seen such a fake piece of facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why Timothy Hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me. It is a turkey, plain and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity I have seen in quite a while.

&#34;Fat Girls&#34; is among the worst films within the indie gay genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The premise is promising: an average-looking gay teen is trapped in a repressive small TX town. His only kindred spirits are the other village HS misfits: the class &#39;fat girl&#39;, a naïve immigrant from Cuba, and the sensitive drama teacher. So far, interesting. In theory, this plot line creates a decent setup for an appealing coming of age story with a built-in audience---the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across America and experienced this adolescent anxiety first hand, peppered with a dose of self-deprecating humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, rather than a nuanced dramedy, Ash Christian approaches his autobiographical subject matter with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor. The result is a cast of unlikeable, derivative, two-dimensional characters which the viewer cannot but help feel indifferent toward. Sabrina (Fink) is a quasi-Goth bitter navel-gazer. She is such a prickly, unsympathetic person; there is little doubt as to the reason for her friendless condition. The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) registers zero. This may have been bad casting, but is more likely due to a screenplay which is simply unsalvageable. Consequently, one is left wondering when there is such a non-existent bond, what could possibly warrant their near-constant companionship throughout the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabrina&#39;s newfound boyfriend, Rudy (de Jesus), and Rodney&#39;s mother Judy (Theaker) are among the most exaggerated of the clichéd stock characters ripped off from dozens of other films. Rudy is the horny undersexed immigrant/nerd lifted directly from every raunchy adolescent &#34;comedy&#34; ever made within the realm of TV or film. Judy is the born-again obsessed with Jesus- talk and big hair. Just when you thought the Tammy Faye thing had been done to death, Christian inserts a scene where Judy&#39;s mascara is running with her tears! Is there anyone in the civilized world that can possibly think this tired old stereotype gag is still funny after seeing it ad nauseum for 20 years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the failed attempts at sardonic humor, there are many puzzling story inconsistencies. Rodney considers himself a &#34;fat ugly&#34; loser. However, he simultaneously manages to participate in casual and regular impromptu trysts with the ubiquitous school jock/hunk, Ted (Miller). Although these liaisons are devoid of emotional fulfillment, most gay teens (filled with raging testosterone, just like their hetero brethren) would find this to be a rather enviable arrangement given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rodney finds an object for his affection in Bobby (Bruening), an exotic transplant from England. Against all believable odds, the lad not only happens to land in this tiny TX hamlet, but is conveniently openly gay to boot. Like Sabrina, Bobby is an icy, angry smart aleck and the viewer is left head-scratching as to his magnetic appeal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to his delight, Rodney is invited by his new crush to the town gay bar, where Bobby claims to be the DJ. Upon arrival, the boyfriend-to-be promptly leaves Rodney solo and heads off to another area of the bar for a quick encounter with a rather handsome young man. This is yet one more of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since Rodney&#39;s feeling as an outcast are supposedly derived largely from his lonely existence in a parochial town. As tiny as the town is, they have openly gay students at the high school? A secretly bisexual football captain? Lesbian moms? A Gay teacher? and it has a gay bar downtown (patronized by attractive men, no less)? Apparently, the place is not so backwater after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years earlier, Todd Stephens&#39; &#34;Edge of Seventeen&#34; covered nearly the same material with a much more creative, honest, touching, and humorous film.

Shemp finds out that he stands to inherit a million dollars IF he is married within 24 hours. Considering how hideous he looks and his personality, it isn&#39;t surprising that he can&#39;t get a taker--that is until an article appears in the paper explaining his predicament--at which point five crazed women appear from no where to claim their new hubby (plus the money, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#39;t hate the Three Stooges and like to watch their shorts on occasion, they never, even on their best day, came close to the brilliant comedy of Buster Keaton. That&#39;s why I disliked this film, as it was a ripoff of the plot from Keaton&#39;s masterpiece, SEVEN CHANCES. With the Stooges it wasn&#39;t uncommon for Columbia Pictures to steal old comedy plots or just recycle older Stooge shorts. So, from the outset, this film is a pale imitation of an original. It&#39;s also obvious that this film lacks the charm and subtlety of the original and the gags generally seem very forced (paricularly the phone booth scene). The cousin Basil bit, however, was pretty cute and funny--though far from subtle! However, the worst aspect of the film was the not particularly funny conclusion. In the Keaton version, hundreds of women appeared to marry him and the action became very fast and furious--here, it all stayed in one small room and lacked comedic punch--ending in a fizzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a dull retread. Also, before marking this review &#34;not helpful&#34;, be sure to FIRST see SEVEN CHANCES to see what I am talking about--then you decide.

Passionate, dramatic, riveting as Flamenco itself, the film is simply amazing. It is set on the immortal Bizet&#39;s music. The original music is written and performed by one of the greatest classical guitarists, leading proponent of the Modern Flamenco style, Paco de Lucia who plays a musician with the same name. Legendary Flamenco dancer and choreographer Antonio Gades co/wrote the script and choreographed this fabulous version of the celebrated Georges Bizet/Prosper Mérimée novella/opera. He plays a main character Antonio, the famous dancer/choreographer who works on retelling the story of Carmen in the Flamenco style that combines dances with singing and rhythmic hand clapping and has a highly charged level of dynamics that appeals enormously to the viewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant and graceful Cristina Hoyos whose technical excellence matches the elegant artistry of her dancing shines in the supporting role. Hoyos had been the first dancer in Gades&#39; company for twenty years (1968-1988) and she was the protagonist of three films that Carlos Saura made of Gades&#39; three great shows: &#34;Bodas de Sangre&#34; (1978), &#34;Carmen&#34; (1983) and &#34;El Amor Brujo&#34; (1985). Gorgeous Laura del Sol is a young dancer named Carmen in whom Antony sees from the first sight another Carmen, who was immortalized by two Frenchmen, the writer Prosper Mérimée in his most famous novella written in 1846 that had inspired George Bizet&#39;s world famous Opéra-Comique version from 1875.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in the opera and in the novella, Carmen in Saura&#39;s film is desirable and deadly, the ultimate femme fatale who has to be free above anything else. She could not tolerate the possessive love of any man and would prefer death to submission. There some 50 movie adaptations of the story and the opera to the screen, and as different as they are, they all have in common the only possible tragic end. Saura/Gades&#39; film is unique as the most sensual of all and truly Spanish. I fell in love with it from the first time I saw it over twenty years ago and it is as special and beautiful today as it was back then. Highly recommended.

This week, I just thought it would be fun to catch up with Corey Haim, with just having seen the two &#34;Lost Boys&#34; films last week and all. Not that I&#39;m a fan-boy - not by far - but I did like those two Coreys in some films back in my early teen days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I prepared myself for three films starring him. Unfortunately, I picked &#34;Dream Machine&#34; as a first (never seen it before), and it was so godawfully horrible, I just decided to lock Corey back in my closet and let him sober up again first, before I pop in something else of his. But I managed to struggle my way through this film first. I had the impression it desperately wanted to play in the same league as &#34;Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off&#34; (1986) but got caught up in its own delusions. Practically the whole film it wants to be a comedy and near the end it hopelessly tries to be a thriller. The only good thing about &#34;Dream Machine&#34; is the premise: A dead body in the trunk of a Porsche. All the rest fails so badly, it&#39;s embarrassing. Even the most for Haim. I can dig him being his young, enthusiastic self, but at least when he comes with some form of directorial guidelines. This clearly wasn&#39;t the case in &#34;Dream Machine&#34;. So, we have a perfect car, yes, that black Porsche. Haim&#39;s perfect girlfriend? Just a blonde chick who hardly has any lines in the film. The perfect murder... almost? Some dude that falls flat on his ass as the villain of the film, trying the whole movie to steal the body back out of the trunk, never really succeeds, and then at the end of the film thinks he&#39;s Michael Myers (minus the white William Shatner mask) and mistakes Corey Haim for Jamie Lee Curtis. Don&#39;t think they could have made this flick any lamer if they tried. A stupid, unfunny film with a story that leads to nowhere directed by a director that doesn&#39;t know how to direct his cast. Great accomplishment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last question for Mr. Haim: Who&#39;s idea was it to have you smile directly into the camera in that last shot of the movie? Yours or the director&#39;s? So not done.

Well, i must admit, when i saw the trailer for this movie, i was looking forward to it. I am generally a fan of light hearted romantic comedies and from the trailer, thats the impression i got of this movie. However, i spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin. Although there were a couple of amusing scenes, in general the outlook of the movie was quite depressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters as they all seemed a little underdeveloped, the time which the director could have used exploring the characters taken up by a needless overuse of Opera, making the movie feel dragged out and slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, although there are some touching scenes, the trailer is quite deceptive and i would only suggest you go watch this if there is really nothing else that tickles your fancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not fantastic, and as i have said before; Bland.

This anime is a must-see for fans of Evangelion. It&#39;s an earlier work of Anno Hideaki, but his unrestrained, dramatic style is quite in place. Also, those who didn&#39;t like Evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable. Gunbuster is rather unique to sci-fi anime in that it&#39;s actually based on real science. In fact, the show has several little &#34;Science Lesson&#34; interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie. One of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light. The series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an Earth where ten years have passed. The main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably. Be warned, this show is heavy on the sap at times. It also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that I have ever seen. I found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, because the series is otherwise very good, but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one. On an interesting note, Gainax, as always, managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes. However, they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway. The ending is a bit silly, but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut I couldn&#39;t help but love it. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the finest pieces of Anime around.

Her embalmed look was totally inappropriate for the role. Her face remained too white, hair too coifed, clothes etc. too clean (and well-fitting, especially her father&#39;s old hat and coat in the scene where Inman comes home) for any sense of accuracy. It would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to remain clean and perfect, too, but she was the only one who didn&#39;t get messy. There was never even a smudge on her powdered cheek. Are we to believe she was the only person in the Civil War with a bathtub and a mirror? She certainly looked like the only one who used them. Tweezers, too; I mean, what&#39;s with those eyebrows? She looked absolutely mean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The love story was implausible. She only went over to the guy because someone told her that he had said he thought she was cute. So, she goes over to tease him, then flirts with him a couple more times, and suddenly this is a love on a par with Odysseus and Penelope? Please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known better than to expect anything better from the man who brought us &#34;The English Patient.&#34; My reaction to that one was the same as Elaine&#39;s on Seinfeld: &#34;It sucked.&#34;

One of Chaplin&#39;s longest films up to that point, Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then &#34;Prosper Merimee&#39;s&#34; well-known story about &#34;Carmen.&#34; I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDb&#39;s listing of the 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on the running time I assume that it was the 1915 version that I saw, since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes longer, and from what I&#39;ve read, those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the very beginning, it&#39;s clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin&#39;s most complex and ambitious efforts to date, starting off with a long back story, told through inter-titles, about the tragic love story of Carmen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carmen is sent by a band of gypsies (&#34;A band who put the GYP in gypsy.&#34;), to seduce a Spanish officer so they can pull off their smuggling operation. It&#39;s a clever, Chaplinesque band of criminals, the leader of whom, Lillas Pastia, has &#34;spent 50 years learning to steal, thinking he might be offered a job in politics.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I&#39;ve seen some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of Chaplin&#39;s earlier work, but probably none quite as overt as in this one. Near the beginning of the movie, as the band of gypsies are traveling, there is a scene where the mules and women are loading, and an inter-title explains that &#34;the mules are the ones with long ears.&#34; In case you couldn&#39;t tell, I guess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chaplin plays the part of Don Jose, the hapless officer who is to be seduced by Carmen. He is described as &#34;a brave soldier and lover of women.&#34; Not exactly a stretch for Chaplin who removed any doubt about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant Shoulder Arms. And of course, he didn&#39;t have to act about being a lover of women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is different here, of course, is his polished military uniform and straight-backed disciplinary manner, interspersed, of course, with some of his traditional slap-stick moves. He strikes me as a little guy in a position of authority, struggling to maintain the respect of his subordinates by exerting a gruff, stolid exterior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Carmen enters (&#34;Loved by all men under the age of 96&#34;), and she immediately begins flirting with Charlie. I should mention that for a good majority of the movie, it is surprisingly faithful to the original story, which was full of jealousy and tragedy. Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover, able to evoke a jealous passion that I&#39;ve never seen from him. There&#39;s at least one scene where he is genuinely a little scary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chaplin has some great sight gags in the movie, like a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fighting near the end. And his boyish charm and the role of a soldier is also definitely a winning combination, although there is another peculiar stunt involving a group of men pushing a huge door back and forth that wasn&#39;t very effective to begin with but just kept going on and on and on, probably about five times longer than it was worth. Although it was interesting that when it finally fell over it clearly was revealed as a movie prop. I always appreciate such glimpses at the old movie sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end of the film is it&#39;s strongest part. It bears striking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet, but just when you think that Chaplin is going to conduct a major thematic experiment by diverging distantly from his traditional style, there is a hilarious twist that is as vintage Chaplin as anything I&#39;ve ever seen. Nice work!

This movie was like a bad indie with A-list talent. The plot was silly, all the way to the end. It reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980&#39;s. I would have given it a one, but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile. I think the worst thing was the underwater scene&#39;s held off of the dock. The underwater lighting seemed to come from no were, and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air, this air tank would kind of appear. I would avoid this, unless there is nothing else on the shelf. Good Day.

Michael Keaton has really never been a good actor; in the Tim Burton Batman movies he always falls in the shadows of his great villains. Here, he stars as a widowed husband that picks up radio frequencies that seems like is dead people that tries making contact with the living...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is supposed to be a pretty shocking thriller, but it really misses about every spot there is shocking you. Because there&#39;s way too much stuff that ends up unexplained, undiscovered and uninteresting. So where&#39;s the shocking excitement when it all gets so bad movie made in the first place that WHITE NOISE makes a fool out of itself? Truly bad acting and horrifying edited, this movie is nothing to watch. Michael Keaton tries making a thriller comeback but ends up missing the target more than ever.

I enjoyed the Mr. Magoo cartoons I saw while growing up. And I enjoy Leslie Nielson&#39;s comic skills. So, I thought, this marriage must produce a funny child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was just awful. I don&#39;t recall a single funny moment. This is one of the two or three times (in hundreds of films over the years) I&#39;ve wanted my money back. You will leave this film dejected because you won&#39;t ever have that time back to use in a better way. In a comedy, the plot must draw in the viewer and serve as a framework for gags. This plot does neither. It just kinda lies there, gasping like a beached fish.

As an ordinary movie-watcher I can&#39;t say I enjoyed watching this one. It&#39;s not too emotional for a drama, not too gripping for a thriller, not too fast for an action. Plus, some moments of the movie are hardly credible. OK, I understand, soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there, but it&#39;s hard to believe that a person would risk his life, carjack into the middle of a hostile city, and after being shouted at by a professor&#39;s wife run away, without having asked a question (in a proper way). It would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so, but it&#39;s supposed to be a SERIOUS film about war.. There are several episodes like this, so the whole picture makes an impression that it&#39;s just a raw preview of a movie, and it needs considerable work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier, but all these &#39;curves&#39; of his psychology seem simply unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This picture left a question in my head: WHY? Why they gave it an Oscar? Why SIX? And IMHO it&#39;s the most thrilling part of the movie :)

Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance, open-mindness, and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the United States has ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the American political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the increase of violence and death in the streets...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare, be different, and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures. Coppola&#39;s film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making, following the parameters of war and adventure films, and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life, the reason of death, or the ethics of war. It is also a passionate work, made against all odds, chronicled in the 1991 documentary &#34;Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker&#39;s Apocalypse&#34;; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam war ever to reach the screen. This may not be the definite Vietnam motion picture, but dealing with it Coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two Vietnam movies made simultaneously, &#34;The Deer Hunter&#34; and &#34;Coming Home&#34;, or in latter ones as &#34;Platoon&#34; and &#34;Casualties of War&#34;, before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre, as horror in &#34;Jacob&#39;s Ladder&#34;, or comedies as &#34;Good Morning, Vietnam&#34;, among the more respectable. Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life, without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war.

This movie is a window on the world of Britain in 1973 - a world of holiday camps, fags and birds. I was actually at Pontins Prestatyn while this was being filmed, so it&#39;s fascinating to see where I holidayed as a kid, and what a world we have left behind. The &#39;plot&#39;, such as it is, concerns Stan and Jack&#39;s attempts to turn a job at a holiday camp(25 quid a week!) into an opportunity for chasing young women and winding up Blakey. They are joined by the rest of Stan&#39;s family and some laughs are to be had from Arthur (Michael Robbins) and Olive&#39;s (Anna Karen) persistent chuntering, as well as the sheer oddness of Blakey, but the idea that young women would see anything desirable in brilliantined Stan (Reg Varney) or lecherous Jack (Bob Grant) is just risible. Harmless enough in its time, now it&#39;s just a curio from a bygone age.

I have read reviews of this film that found it &#39;disappointing&#39; and &#39;confused&#39;. I am at a loss to understand why this should be so. From the beginning I found it a remarkable experience and a complete joy to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoiler: The opening titles overlay a beautiful visual of the evolutionary process, and this introduces the story with a serene and sweeping style. The film isn&#39;t about the process itself though, it concerns Charles Darwin&#39;s struggle with his conscience, his love for his wife, his deceased daughter and his search for truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The appearances of his daughter are the manifestations of a tormented mind that knows it has &#34;killed God&#34;. The daughter is an adult, making adult comments about his work and torturing Darwin with personal doubts. Was he in some way responsible for her death? Husband and wife in real life Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly give truly wonderful performances as Charles and Emma Darwin, as does Martha West as Annie. Bettany&#39;s size and awkward gait give Darwin&#39;s character a genuine sense of reality, whilst Connelly seems very comfortable with her English accent and occasionally somewhat severe persona.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s easy to misunderstand the times in which this film resides. The grip that religion had on society and the inner struggles that a man like Darwin must have endured to seek the truth in what he witnessed. Science and religion have always been awkward bedfellows and although it didn&#39;t cost him his life, as it did with so many earlier men and women, science put a barrier between husband and wife, fact and faith. This film portrays that barrier supremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Creation ten stars, because I think it&#39;s beautiful, profound, superbly well acted and a genuine, no-extraneous-frills-required look at one of the world&#39;s true geniuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What seems obvious to everyone today (well, almost everyone... see Bill Maher&#39;s wonderful &#34;Religulous&#34;) was hidden for millennia. The truth, once it was discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation examines that pain, and the realisation that we are all that we possess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful cinematic experience.

This seemed really similar to the CHILD&#39;S PLAY movies except so much worse. A lawyer tries to save a criminal, who was convicted of killing his son, from execution. She fails. The lawyer&#39;s daughter then finds a puppet that the killer had buried with his son and is immediately attached to it. Then after several people are seriously injured they find the little girl secretly talking to the doll saying that she didn&#39;t hurt anyone. Throughout this movie I found myself asking myself &#39; why am I watching this cheeze?&#39; over and over. The end sucked so bad that I went and watched the Disney cartoon version right after and slept with the light on.

Maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way of making a living but it&#39;s still a way to make a living. However, after watching this movie, one may come away believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy, bloated, conceited, paper pusher who lives exclusively to partake of his next lunch break. Not exactly a pretty picture, but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another tedious, noisy, overacted action movie. Just what the doctor ordered ... right? How many more of these movies has Hollywood made? One thousand? Two thousand? The formula for making these movies is so beaten into the dust that by now it should be completely unrecognizable. The locales change but the plots remain the same, and with the same shallow character development and the equally shallow acting as trained performers are asked to devolve into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. This movie seemed to run-on interminably. &#34;When will this movie end?&#34; I repeatedly thought to myself. Leonardo DiCaprio was totally unbelievable as a CIA operative, but what has to be one of the great gaffs of miscasting, an overweight Russell Crowe plays a CIA bureaucrat. Please note that in this movie the on site operative is &#34;lean and mean&#34; while his desk jockey supervisor is fat. This is called stereotyping. What was the casting director thinking? Why not have Jack Nicholson play an overweight office clerk? Or Nicole Kidman play a frumpy department store saleswoman? And the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it credibility. An obviously non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio) trying to pass himself off as an Arab ... speaking fluent Arabic ... concocting all kinds of hair brain schemes that are doomed to failure ... trying to out think and outfox real Arabs who are completely unfooled by his laughable Arab masquerade ... trying to romance a Palestinian woman while in the middle of conducting a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc. By now you get the point. Next time try casting an actual Arab in the role. Not even the most naive movie goer can believe all that. There should be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist. In this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles. Next stop for this movie - DVD land and oblivion. And one other thing. Don;t let this movie discourage you from working for the government. The pay may not be great, but the fringe benefits are excellent, a critical fact that this movie conveniently omits.

Charles Bronson stars as Lt Crowe a police detective who declares war on a pimp named Duke (Juan Fernandez) who kidnaps the daughter of a Japanese businessman who is the man who sexually harassed Crowe&#39;s daughter (Amy Hathaway) in this sleazy yet stylishly helmed revenge thriller. Kinjite may not be for everyone with it&#39;s somewhat disturbing plot threads but it is well made and indeed entertaining.

Yeah, there&#39;s a &#34;sleeper&#34; watching Sleeper Cell and it was me. After reading comparisons to &#34;24&#34; (like on the cover of the DVD), I expected a fast-paced action romp. But nope... this series just putts along. In my groggy half-awake state I would think, &#34;He&#39;s gonna... &#34; and, poof, it would happen... &#34;Guess that van is gonna roll off the... &#34; and there she goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why would Darwyn, in extra-deep cover, pursue a babe? Could it be, perhaps, to provide a little T&amp;A? Hey, that works for me, hence four stars rather than three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show is no &#34;24&#34;. I&#39;ve watched &#34;24&#34;. Sleeper Cell, you&#39;re no &#34;24&#34;.

&#34;Snow Queen&#34; is based, of course, on the fairy tale of the same name, collected in (at least) Andersen&#39;s Fairy Tales - and, unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales, this one retains the spirit of Faerie, an accomplishment not easy and not well understood by many, especially among Americans. Talking animals, arbitrary prohibitions, appearances of goblins, dragons, and demons, are not to be questioned in a fairy tale; they are as natural an element of Faerie as, say, gravity is in the scientific world, and the reason or explanation for them is completely beside the point of the story. Nor is the story bound by modern Hollywood rules of composition: direct, often to the point of being grotesquely linear in lesser works, and obvious (in retrospect, at least).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this defence against the common criticisms of those who do not understand fairy tales, &#34;Snow Queen&#34; is a delightful movie with wonderful visual effects, skillful acting, and great sentiment. The only flaw in the movie was, I think, not that it was too fantastical but that certain parts of the dialogue were too glaringly modern in slang and expression, a mar on its otherwise timeless nature.

This move was on TV last night. I guess as a time filler, because it sucked bad! The movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way. (Not bad tits and ass though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. The &#34;wolf&#34;, if that is what you can call it, is hardly shown fully save his teeth. When it is fully in view, you can clearly see they had some interns working on the CGI, because the wolf runs like he&#39;s running in a treadmill, and the CGI fur looks like it&#39;s been waxed, all shiny :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is full of gore and blood, and you can easily spot who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next. Even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed, they didn&#39;t do a good job at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t even get me started on the actors... Very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds. But then again, if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks, then hey, where do I sign up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall boring and laughable horror.

Angel-A is a change of pace for Besson; monochrome, mawkish and rather mediocre. It is well photographed on location in Paris, although subtitle-readers should note: quick-fire dialogue AND good cinematography may make for frustrating viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is no &#34;Wings of Desire&#34; or &#34;Wonderful Life&#34;. Despite its shared themes (heavenly intervention averts suicide, angel/mortal relationships ensue), Besson does nothing to enlighten or inspire us. Even the well acted, teary moments, rapidly descend into toe-curling sentimentality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film&#39;s flawed ideology irritates; an Angel whose message of love and respect for self is constantly undermined by her own violent and promiscuous behaviour; a &#34;happy ending&#34; which negates the hero&#39;s supposed journey from helplessness to self-esteem and independence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Quite nice to look at but confused moral and philosophical messages tarnish the film precisely where it should shine. 4/10

I have lost count of just how many times I have seen this movie - I probably know the entire dialog backwards - yet I am drawn to it time and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays the eligible bachelor &#34;Kralik&#34; who becomes the secret admirer of Margaret Sullavan&#39;s innocent &#34;Klara&#34;. Kralik secretly becomes Klara&#39;s pen-friend, and at work together Klara confides in Kralik about the content of his (Kralik&#39;s) letters. Clearly Kralik is besotted with Klara - but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the &#34;pen-friend&#34;. Confused? Well you wont be - this story has a sweet, almost sugary ending - but we all know it is the ending we all want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other characters worth mentioning are Frank Morgan playing his usual role, this time as the shop&#39;s owner &#34;Hugo Matuschek&#34;, Felix Bressart as &#34;Pirovitch&#34;, Kralik&#39;s confidant. Joseph Schildkraut as the womanising arrogant &#34;Vadas&#34; - so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally William Tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his over-confident upstart of a shop junior &#34;Pepi Katona&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently re-made as &#34;You&#39;ve Got Mail&#34; starring Tom Hanks &amp; Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original - although I suspect younger audiences would disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this film is on in your area over Christmas, I suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a box of Kleenex handy.

Well, I notice IMDB has not offered any plot info...that&#39;s because it&#39;s not possible to do that without sounding vile and disgusting...because that&#39;s what this movie is...VILE AND DISGUSTING !! I watched it because I am a humongous Fan of Chris Noth, whom I have met in person and he is a great guy...but if I ever meet him again, I will have no qualms about asking him whatever posessed him to star in something so awful. He plays a former child prodigy who is now a brilliant doctor, who spends his spare time running over small children with his car, with the intent of maiming and crippling them...this is not a &#34;spoiler&#34;, because all this is made very clear from the begining...sickening enough?? Oh, it gets better...he is manipulated into doing this, by his incestuous sister, who threatens to with-hold sexual favors from him if their latest victim fails to die...even Clive Barker couldn&#39;t write anything so hideous. Please, if you want to see Chris Noth in something worthy of his talent, rent &#34;Teddy Roosevelt and The Roughriders&#34;

Channel zapping one night I just caught the start of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning. It tells the sad story of an adopted child, Adam, whose mother left him after birth. The movie takes us through his childhood, and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from Adam&#39;s past. I will not reveal more, but it is a very in-depth movie and will intrigue you for sure. This was one of Jimmy Smits best roles in my opinion.

Sky Captain is possibly the best awful movie I&#39;ve seen in a long while. Rife with amazing CG and special effects, studded with an A-list cast (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and the infinitely likable Giovanni Ribisi) and racing along with an overused but Indiana Jones-esquire storyline, this should have been a great movie to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Should have&#39; being the key term here, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude Law plays Joe the Sky Captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over-the-shoulder, heart-melting smirks, but you can&#39;t make something out of nothing, and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks can&#39;t save the movie&#39;s stone dialogue. (If he had slapped Giovanni Ribisi on the back and said, &#34;Good boy, Dex,&#34; just ONE more time, I might have barfed all over the guy in front of me.) Gwyneth Paltrow, as Polly Perkins, is nothing less than nerve grating. Her nasal whining and not-quite-sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie. Perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical 30&#39;s comic book heroine- who knows? I expected more from her. An example of how a similar character was played (and played well) is in the late 90&#39;s flick &#34;The Phantom,&#34; starring Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane. Rent the movie and you&#39;ll know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie were the saving graces in the film. (Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch. I&#39;ll admit it.) In just a few short scenes, both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry, two-dimensional castmates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot and steady story progression were old, boring, and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years. The pace is rapid-fire in the first half of the movie, and a snail&#39;s pace in the second, giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film, but to figure out who the key villain is as well. The pairing is rather clichéd, also- Polly Perkins and Sky Captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly-ended romance, and their story isn&#39;t so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched. When they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film, nobody&#39;s surprised, and nobody really cares either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Props to the director for appreciating Bai Ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film, and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout. But Sky Captain, despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie, falls flat on its face. Not even worth the $2.75 I paid to get into the theater.

OK, so she doesn&#39;t have caller ID. When you are being stalked, you GET IT! And no cell phone? When you are being stalked, you GET ONE if you are one of the few full time working parents that is the head of the household that doesn&#39;t own one already. This mom gets a big ZERO in the parenting department. So her mom is in the hospital and she decides a shopping trip will help her out. Just a stupid movie. Glad I have Tivo and a FF button on the remote.And what is with the 10 line minimum, I just don&#39;t have that much to say about such a bad movie. I guess I can ask why she keeps opening packages that she has no clue who they are from. The son really didn&#39;t add much to the movie either. The cops were a big ol zero too. Now get to the nearest Verizon and get the darn cell phone. @@

The only way I can feel good about having handed over these precious minutes of my life is everyday telling someone how awful it was. And even if I say it once a day, every day for the rest of my life I will not fully get my point across. Just dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s a difference in movies like this and movies like Elephant or Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid, two of my other least favorite movies. The latter two were terrible, yes, but that was that. Evan Almighty takes a strong cast and attempts to kill them all. Wanda Sykes, Jonah Hill, John Goodman and Steve Carrell...WHY GOD WHY!? All these people have much better talent, now every time I see any of them I will think of this terrible movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 was when I saw the movie, there was a mentally challenged elderly woman who thought the barrage of bird poop and getting-hurt-by-tools-while-building jokes were so funny that she didn&#39;t stop laughing the entire time, nearly stroking out at several times.

The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made, including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life, he would be in shock. And, as usual in thrillers, the assassin doesn&#39;t kill the heroes, giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (US President commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens, ha ha), and this effort runs it close. For such an implausible film, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who didn&#39;t laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting, &#34;You are going to be blown up&#34;. Who didn&#39;t know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who didn&#39;t spot the baddie? Technically also, the film was awful. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover, many scenes looked like mud. The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looked like the Vatican -- an achievement, because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around St Peter&#39;s -- and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magic place, and I enjoyed seeing it fleetingly.

I didn&#39;t even know this was originally a made-for-tv movie when I saw it, but I guessed it through the running time. It has the same washed-out colors, bland characters, and horrible synthesized music that I remember from the 80&#39;s, plus a &#39;social platform&#39; that practically screams &#34;Afterschool special&#34;. Anyhoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rona Jaffe&#39;s (thank you) Mazes and Monsters was made in the heyday of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a pen-and-paper RPG that took the hearts of millions of geeks around America. I count myself one of said geeks, tho I have never played D&amp;D specifically I have dabbled in one of its brethren. M&amp;M was also made in the heyday of D&amp;D&#39;s major controversy-that it was so engrossing that people could lose touch with reality, be worshiping Satan without knowing, blah blah. I suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point, if extremely rare-but it dates this movie horrendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We meet 4 young college students, who play the aptly named Mazes and Monsters, to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life. Except that M&amp;M as presented is more boring than their mundane lives. None of the allure of gaming is presented here-and Jay Jay&#39;s request to take M&amp;M into &#39;the real world&#39; comes out of nowhere. It&#39;s just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere also-though at that point we don&#39;t really care. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel are supposed to be different-but they&#39;re all rich WASPy prigs who have problems no one really has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things just continue, getting worse in more ways than one. The low budget comes dreadfully clear, (I love the &#39;Entrance&#39; sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns) Robbie/Pardu shows why he&#39;s not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene ever, and the payoff atop the &#39;Two Towers&#39; is unintentionally hilarious. Tom Hanks&#39; blubbering &#34;Jay Jay, what am I doing here?&#34; made me laugh for minutes on end. Definitely the low point in his career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t look at it as a cogent satire, just a laughable piece of 80&#39;s TV trash, and you&#39;ll still have a good time. That is, if you can stay awake. The majority is mostly boring, but it&#39;s all worthwhile for Pardu&#39;s breakdown at the end. At least Tom Hanks has gotten better. Not that he could go much worse from here.

Since September of last year, I have been borrowing four to six films each week from the Harold Washington Library, which boasts an impressive DVD collection. (The HWL truly is a circulating library: three-quarters of its films are out at any given time!) Recently, I was thrilled to find The Short Films of David Lynch. Yesterday, knowing little about the animated series, I picked up Dumbland. I&#39;m here to report that, for David Lynch fans, watching the eight episodes is half an hour well-spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most remarkable feature of these brief pieces are their soundtracks. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion. Outrageous voices accent pauses&#39; ends. Physical violence supplies the beats. Chirping birds and buzzing sockets brush along the edges. Many other elements fill out the orchestra. The pacing of the crude animation often keeps in sync with the sound, but the soundtrack itself struck me as Lynch&#39;s primary interest in creating and disseminating this work. In a way, these eight shorts are unique Lynchian rhythms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the situations are odd, ugly, profound, dumb and funny as hell. And there&#39;s enough space within them to reflect on how absurd we humans can be. I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ll watch the collection again, but for anyone who revelled in the movements that is the suite Inland Empire, Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time.

Oh man. If you want to give your internal Crow T. Robot a real workout, this is the movie to pop into the ol&#39; VCR. The potential for cut-up lines in this film is just endless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Minor spoilers ahead. Hey, do you really care if a film of this quality is &#34;spoiled?&#34;) Traci is a girl with a problem. Psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite-sex parent. But this girl seems to have one for her same-sex one, and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a term for that. It might be because her mother Dana is played by Rosanna Arquette, whose cute overbite, neo-flowerchild sexuality and luscious figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters. Here Dana is not only clueless to her daughter&#39;s conduct; she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the Olympic Indulgent Mother competition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s possible that Dana misses Traci&#39;s murderous streak because truth be told, Traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster. It&#39;s only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of Carmen, a Mexican maid who is described by Dana as around so long she&#39;s like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say, &#34;I just fell off the tomato truck from Guadalajara.&#34; Carmen is so wise to Traci&#39;s scheming, she might also wear a sign saying, &#34;Hey, I&#39;m the Next Victim!&#34; Sure enough, Traci confronts Carmen as Carmen is making her way back from Mass, and bops her with one of those slightly angled lug wrenches that car manufacturers put next to your spare as a bad joke. I rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for changing a tire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In another sequence, Arquette wears a flimsy dress to a vineyard, under cloudy skies, talking to the owner. Cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny skies, talking to the owner&#39;s brother. Then cut to her wearing the first dress, in the first location, under cloudy skies - but it&#39;s supposed to be later. You get the picture. We&#39;re talking really bad directing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for skin, don&#39;t expect much, although Traci does own a nice couple of bikinis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking for a trash wallow, 8. For anybody else, 1/2.

Eastenders has gone full circle from unmissable in 1985 to totally abysmal now. It&#39;s such a bad reflection of the nation this crap tops the ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ideas for plots can consist of nothing more trivial than putting ever characters name in a hat. The first two out (regardless of their sex) will sleep with each other, the 3rd &amp; 4th out will have a fight in the Vic, the 5th one will be arrested, the 6th develop an addiction, 7th get pregnant etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The producers are clever though. The 30 minute show is only actually ever comprised of 3 lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Someone will walk in the Vic &amp; say &#34;What&#39;s goin on?&#34; 2) Someone else will stand up say &#34;leave it aht&#34; (out) 3) Then a woman will say &#34;Doan choo come in ere &#39;n&#39; insult mah fam&#39;ly&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s it. That&#39;s every show. Apart from the occasional &#34;Get it sort-id / Is it sort-id?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show was once a realistic portrayal of East End folk &amp; their way of life. The buffers came off when 1) They extended it from two nights a week &amp; 2) The Slater family turned up. How they attract viewers is beyond me. The Kat character symbolizes everything that&#39;s gone wrong with society, treating anyone else like something she&#39;s pulled off the bottom of her shoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who vote her the best character, in these polls, must the same as the ones that vote Jamie Redknapp &#39;Best Sportsman&#39; despite the fact he hasn&#39;t played a game for 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of British TV why do all the biggest names leave? Ross Kemp, Martin Kemp, the list is endless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long has the longest couple&#39;s marriage lasted, with them being faithful to each other? Yes, people leave, but until the script writers realise that characters, couple can be interesting &amp; likeable without sleeping around the show will continue to deteriorate. An episode last week had 3 separate plots of exactly that. And Zoe &amp; the doctor top even Lofty &amp; &#39;Shell&#39; as &#39;Most Unconvincing Couple Ever to appear on TV.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Eastenders is the most watched show, thats undisputed. But many external factors contribute to that. 19.30 / 20.00 is the perfect time of day to gain the most audience figures, it has an omnibus edition for 2 hours, and more than that, millions of the viewers watch it, out of nothing more than habit, but if they were completely honest to themselves, they would admit that (in 2002, more than ever), it can be absolutely pitiful.

This unsung quiet gem tells the true story of a POW escape during WW II. The performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The movie works on many different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual, and literal. The dialogue is ingenious and rings very true. In fact, an unusual all-around authenticity puts this one head-and-shoulders above most war epics.

I&#39;ve seen comments from Turkish people (which I&#39;m not) saying this movie is fantastic and accurately portrays Turkish life. All I have to say is... Turkey must be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world, because in my opinion, that is exactly what this movie was to me. If I were Turkish, I think it would have had a greater impact. But if you&#39;re not from Turkey, I would advise you not to waste two hours of your life on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Distant&#34; seems to lag on forever. Many scenes are painstakingly long with little or no purpose. I don&#39;t understand the director&#39;s objectives in even including many of the scenes. It is pointed out that the director used his own car, apartment, and friends in making the movie...Well guess what? It shows. It looks low budget. The acting is poor. If it&#39;s a cultural thing then so be it. I just don&#39;t understand the purpose of basing a movie on this story. It&#39;s unbelievably boring.

Flynn, known mostly for his swashbuckling roles (and his bedroom antics!) takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully. Playing real-life boxing champ Jim Corbett, Flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled San Francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist, all the while setting one eye on society deb Smith. He and best pal Carson attend an illegal bare-knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men (and a dog!) including a prominent judge. The next day, he gets a chance, via Smith, to gain entrance to the judge&#39;s private club. He uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club&#39;s resident boxer. His unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers, up to and including the world champion John L. Sullivan (Bond.) Flynn is downright magical here. He is the epitome of charm, charisma and appeal in this role. He looks terrific (especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit) and does virtually all of his own stuntwork (impressively!) His line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally. Smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for Flynn. At this stage, he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation (he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time) and she does so admirably. She is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude, yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell. Bond is incredibly burly, brawny and towering, yet tender when the script calls for it. Amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient Carson. Frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as Flynn&#39;s manager. The rest of the cast is excellent as well including Flynn&#39;s rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy Nob Hill types. The whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed. A few of the sets are amazingly presented. Some of Smith&#39;s gowns border on the garish, but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well. It&#39;s a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing, but it&#39;s also so much more. Some of it (like the character traits shown by Flynn) is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes, but a lot of it is authentic (like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes.) One line is particularly memorable: &#34;I believe you like me more than I like you, but it&#39;s entirely possible that I love you more than you love me.&#34; It&#39;s classic romantic dialogue (and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well.)

This plot had more holes in it than an OJ Simpson alibi! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed two Star Trek references in the movie and, yet,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ironically we have a lead character played by Andy Garcia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;who is the antithesis of the Vulcan philosophy of, &#34;The&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s just say that while trying to save his son from cancer he puts most of the rest of San Francisco at incredible risk. Michael Keaton&#39;s character is almost as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unrealistic as well. He neglects to kill at numerous opportunities and yet is angered when Garcia foils his&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;attempt to kill a bunch of cops at once. The child&#39;s doctor remains in charge of her faculties even after been&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;held hostage several times in a short expanse of time but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;put her on a wide walkway 5 stories up and she loses it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Garcia&#39;s child is something of an anathema in this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;movie. He is the most sympathetic and real character, one of the movie&#39;s bright spots. He furthermore utters a line, that must have been the result of serendipity, regarding fighting cancer that parallels Keaton&#39;s motivation to escape. All in all, the movie was not a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;complete waste (see From Dusk to Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for that) but disappointing considering the talent on hand.

Because I would have never ever seen this movie through to the end. Although there are some, but not many, funny moments in this movie I couldn&#39;t understand more than about 15%(the fancy English couple in the 3rd story included) of what people were saying. Three short stories, none with a real point, with just some of the most miserable and lifeless people I could have imagined and a load of foul language. Didn&#39;t find it funny, didn&#39;t find it amusing, didn&#39;t find any sense in it. 4/10

Have not seen this 1958 film in a very long time and greatly enjoyed Kim Novak playing the role as Gil Holroyd who is an actual witch and has an aunt named Queenie Holroyd who is also a witch and Gillian also has a brother warlock named Nick played by Jack Lemmon. When Gillian sets her eyes on Shep Henderson,(James Stewart) who is engaged to a girl he is going to marry; Gillian performers some magic spells with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride and then becomes very lust full and falls in love with Gillian. The story tells that a real witch cannot fall in love, blush or cry and this begins to prove a big problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided they have to do something about this situation. Great film to view over and over again and a great classic film from 1958.

When Wallace and Gromit burst onto the scene in their academy award winning short, &#34;A Grand Day Out,&#34; they created a fresh new look at claymation. After two more shorts, Aardman&#39;s dynamic duo returned for this thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie. It has an excellent Voice cast, humorous jokes and good animation as only Aardman could do! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this movie, Wallace and Gromit run &#34;Anti-Pesto,&#34; a rabbit removal company. When word gets out about a &#34;Were-Rabbit&#34; eating all the vegetables in town, a frenzy ensues. Of course, Victor Quartermaine, the town&#39;s handsome, toupee-brandishing huntsman, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the lovely Lady Tottington...but can our favorite Aardman duo save the day before chaos ensues?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jokes, I should say, were hilarious. One point, the villain, Victor Quartermaine&#39;s, booty-crack was showing, prompting a character to cry out: &#34;BEWARE...THE MOON!!!&#34; Vintage Aardman!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are crisp and hilarious. Our favorite Aardman team of Man and Dog entertains us as only they could do, earning them their second Oscar (remember &#34;A Grand Day Out?&#34;). Helena Bonham Carter was terrific as the lovely Lady Tottington, Wallace&#39;s love interest. Ralph Fiennes was especially funny and foreboding as the cunning, toupee wearing hunter Victor Quartermaine. But the one who really stole the show was the priest, whose antics proved to be some hilarious comic relief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hats off to Aardman for creating another Wallace and Gromit masterpiece!

I can honestly say I never expected this movie to be good. I do not like family films. I am far from a fan of Shahid Kapoor. The director&#39;s last movie (MPKDH was complete stupidity. And the music was very boring and bland. But there was Amrita Rao, who has become my favorite after Main Hoon Na. There was also Seema Biswas, Alok Nath, and Anupam Kher who are very talented. So a few plus points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally saw the movie and I was very impressed. He brings us the young lovers of MPK with a pinch of the HAHK wedding, and we have a winner. The story outline is similar to HAHK, light hearted in the beginning to serious mode at the end. The director also made character that you could relate to. The thing I did not like about HAHK was that the characters were too eccentric. The casting adds to its perfection. Shahid Kapoor surprised me with a good performance. This is a major improvement, and most importantly he suits the role. The best is easily Amrita Rao. In fact, this is her best performance. Her screen presence is so electrifying, you are bound to love her performance. Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, Anupam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are terrifically cast. Not one actor feels out of place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The songs were quite disappointing but they will sound better after watching them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are nice ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also nice in watching. The songs aren&#39;t colorful and dancey, and they are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein which is bound to remind you of HSSH and HAHK. So what was the flaw in the movie? The movie gets quite slow, and the ending is quite stretched. But the movie is still goes at a good pace, making it a perfect family film.

Gundam Wing is a fun show. I appreciate it for getting me into Gundam and anime in general. However, after watching its predecessors, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, and even G Gundam, I find Wing to be Gundam Lite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Characters: An aspect long held by Gundam is to have their characters thrust into difficulties and grow into maturity. This does not happen in Wing. Heero is top dog at the beginning, and he&#39;s top dog at the end. Personalities do not change, growth is never achieved. The best character is Zechs, who is for all intents and purposes a hero throughout most of the series. But suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mecha: Wing has great suit designs. The Gundams are super cool, with the Epyon being my favorite. I even consider a few of the OZ suit designs to be on par with some of the classic Zeon suits. But sweet suit designs doesn&#39;t quite save the series from boring characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: In the end, Wing has cool fight scenes, though riddled with recycled animation, but shallow plot and character development. Enjoyable, but not moving like previous Gundam outings.

Why me? Why should I be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot?! At least if I can warn other people off, it will have been worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to watch this horrible movie for a college course. Otherwise, I would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and steered clear. The movie was slow, had PAINFULLY little character development, and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an LA-style token black man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to experience the stereotypical LA feeling of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie. Note, though, that this movie does not DEPICT what we have come to think of as an &#34;LA lifestyle&#34;, it is a wonderful example of the products that ARISE from it.

This is one of those films that looks so &#34;dated&#34; that being that way is part of the fun. You see and hear things you would NEVER see or hear on the silver screen today. Some of that is good; some it too corny for words, some of it bad (depending on your viewpoints on certain cultural issues.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, in this short (68 minutes) 1931 film you have:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grandpa of the family that is featured in this story extolling the value of patriotism and why one should speak up against criminals for the good of the United States (picture that in today&#39;s films!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A district attorney (Walter Huston) almost begging for death penalty sentences and the populace shown as supporting it 100 percent (once again, picture that in modern-day movies.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way you have some shocking violence, such as a young boy being picked up a few times and literally thrown head first into a closet, and his father being picked up and swung repeatedly head-first into a wall. This is a tough stuff, to say the least. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the film is dotted with comedy, mostly by the patriotic grandpa, memorably played by Charles &#34;Chic&#34; Sales. There are a bunch of laughs for all those who view this unique crime film. And, for soft touches, there are the two young boys, one of whom - Dickie Moore - went on to become a pretty famous child actor in his day. Here, he is just a little tyke of about 5 years of age who, understandably, is far from being a polished actor, but you can see stardom for him on the horizon. In fact, he did just that the following year with a solid performance in &#34;Blonde Venus,&#34; starring Marlene Dietrich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is an entertaining film because of an effective mixture of violence, comedy and sentimentality....and it has a nice feel-good ending and a thought-provoking message. It was up for an Academy Award, too, for &#34;Best Writing, Original Story.&#34; I am sorry to say it is only available for viewing on cable TV as it has never been put out on VHS or DVD.....and that&#39;s a shame.

Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is just on the verge of puberty, begins to have strange dreams which start affecting her in real life--especially involving a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers) who she meets in her dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very unusual fantasy with some truly terrifying moments. Despite the fact that this is about a teenage girl and has a PG-13 rating, this is NOT for children. Also, if you hate fantasies stay far away. But if you&#39;re game for something different this fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well directed by Bernard Rose with a just beautiful music score and a few nice, scary jolts. The only thing that prevents this from being a really great movie is Burke--she&#39;s not a very good actress (it&#39;s no surprise that this has been her only film) and it hurts the movie. However, everybody else is just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spiers is very good as Mark; Glenne Headley (faking a British accent very well) is also very good as Anna&#39;s mother and Ben Cross is both frightening and sympathetic as Anna&#39;s father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sleeper hit when released in 1988, it&#39;s since faded away. That&#39;s too bad--it&#39;s really very good.

Sylvester the cat stowaway upon a ship that Tweety bird happens to be on with his owner Granny. Oh I don&#39;t even have enough words to convey how much I disdain both the Tweety and Granny characters. They simply are not funny to me and made this short quite the chore to sit through indeed. Sylvester is a great character on his own, but there&#39;s only so much he can do when confronted by the sheer awfulness of that accursed bid and senile old witch of a Granny. This animated short can be found on disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 and features an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: D+

I watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago, and It was quite possibly one of the most boring, unfunny films I ever had the misfortune of seeing. First of all Matthew Modine is a terrible actor, and ruined most of the movie, on top of that, the plot is just way too silly. The only reason a checked into this film was because of Alec Baldwin, and his character was eliminated pretty quickly. Unless you are a fan of Michelle Phiffer you should probably avoid this movie like the plague. Many people can&#39;t praise this film enough, but I just cannot figure out what people find so terrific about it. If its supposed to be the black humor that makes this film so terrific, then I guess anything can pass for comedy these days.

Just finished with Zombie Bloodbath part one on the amazing Zombie Bloodbath Trilogy DVD from CAMP Motion Pictures. Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage of the Undead is next. Now this one left me a bit puzzled due to a few plot holes and some confusing twists here and there, but it is a better film on many levels. Director Todd Sheets truly shows a major leap in style and talent between the two films. Again, this is not for people who want gloss and Hollywood style Horror films, this is for people who like their zombies bloody, raw and grainy. The story as far as I could tell, was basically about two robbers who in 1945 try and steal from an elderly couple only to find that the couple are members of a cult. One guy is simply killed and the other, the one in charge, is basically turned into a scarecrow and crucified and they stand him in the nearby field, still alive but dying. Cut to present day and a van full of college kids break down near a farmhouse. At the same time a group of convicts escape from a nearby jail. Both groups end up at the same house. The house was the one the elderly coupled used to live in and when one of the convicts knocks down the scarecrow and takes it&#39;s jacket, it causes the scarecrow to wake up and he in turn brings the cult members back from the dead. Wow. And this is all in the first half hour. There is another plot also going on in town where a couple of serial killer types have taken some workers at a deli hostage. This actually works though, as the people trapped in the house finally escape and end up in the same Deli. Most of the twists work out pretty good, but it is obvious that the film was just too complex in some spots for it&#39;s own good. It all ends in a huge showdown with the remaining heroes finding a delivery truck or something full of flesh eating bacteria vials. Of course they throw it at the undead and cause some major melting and a few heads to explode and then we get an odd, thought provoking ending. First, let me say, that while it was not always easy to follow, I still had a major good time with this movie. It was fun and the acting was pretty darn good for a low budget effort. It was obvious that Todd Sheets was truly trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie film, and in that regard, he has succeeded. It had better special effects than the first film, great pacing and some cool music and visuals, plus there is a true show-stopper of a shot from INSIDE a mouth as a knife is jammed through it. Care was taken here and it shows. The weakness lies in the scripting and in a few of the lazier performances. Again, I recommend listening to the commentary track. It was even better than the first one and I learned a lot. Like finding out that some of the scenes were shot on Super 8 film for effect and that the film came back ruined from the lab and they could nit use it. And they had already been editing the film by the time they got the film back, so some of the confusion is from a few scenes not being in the film. Also, I learned that Todd Sheets truly has a passion and love for making Horror movies. It shows. The film is a good example of no budget cinema that could have used one more rewrite, but still shines with more style than most DV films I see. Not quite as fun as the first film, though a better movie technically. I really admire Sheets as one of the true innovators and trailblazers in the area of DV cinema... and this one is a great addition to the cheapo zombie genre!

You know, as you get older, you somehow think the movies you did not like when you were younger, might have been because of your youth and inexperience. Case in point, when I saw The Godfather at age 14, I thought it was boring. 20 years later, its an incredible movie to me. In other words, I grew up and began to appreciate great movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I rented Dirty Dancing with my girlfriend last night on her request, as she loved it at age 14 and I hated it at the same age. But I hoped, because I was young and stupid at age 14, perhaps this would be a new experience for me. So I sat down with her to watch, hoping to be enlightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the night after watching Dirty Dancing, I feel a violation. I feel like someone reached into my soul and robbed me of 2 hours of my life from watching this cheese fest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Patrick Swayze plays a 20 year old, but he looks like he is 35. And the premise of the movie is him seducing some underage teenager, wooing her with his dance moves. Really Creepy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the movie is the cliché plot where the &#34;wrong side of the tracks&#34; guy and the &#34;rich smart girl&#34; accidentally fall in love with each other. Of course, their romance is fueled by the fact the &#34;rich girl&#34; can&#39;t dance a lick, so the &#34;poor hero&#34; teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the big end of vacation show, or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you guessed it: The disapproving father soon enters and forbids the two to see each other, and the movie progresses to secret meetings of dance lessons and love making. This all culminates into the final scene where the entire resort rallies around the two young lovers while the once antagonistic father accepts the 35 year old dancer as his teen daughter&#39;s new man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my girlfriend whimpered at the end of the movie as she admitted it was not anything like she remembered. I didn&#39;t press her, but I did smirk a little, and put the Godfather part II in the DVD player.

I really enjoyed this movie. I am a single dad with a 17 year old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. I WISH my girl applied herself so well to solving crimes and helping others! So for me, perhaps this is PG level Fantasyland. I read many Nancy Drew books in my teen years, long, long ago. Sure THIS character was ably played by Emma Roberts but did NOT resemble the Nancy Drew I recall from the books. That is due to script, not the acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma is an adorable teen, playing a self-confident, industrious and proud character with good manners and good taste. She is not caught up in the trendy competitiveness around her. There are some weaknesses in the Plot, aside from not resembling the Nancy Drew of the Books, and trying to figure out what decade we&#39;re in. (like, what is that CAR, Anyway?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the IMDb overview before seeing the film, as I was researching Rachael Leigh Cook from other movies. This is not one of Her best roles, but I will continue looking for more of her films. Rachael was too old to play this lead, but does a fine job as the grown-up orphan central to the mystery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed in other reviews written here. Some expect perfect connection with the books, some expect more credible situations or adult action film. I got what I expected! Good entertainment well targeted to young teen girls, And their Fathers who want good kids with high standards of conduct and achievement. This is a Teen PG Movie, not James Bond! Which would YOU Want for a Role Model for YOUR Teenaged Daughter?

This is quite an amazing film to watch. Using digital technology, the director, Rohmer, has literally encrusted his living actors into painted backdrops. Most of the time this works brilliantly, especially at the start where the film is like a pop up story book come to life. It is less successful in a few scenes, where it limits camera angles (they had not painted the side of some of the buildings for example) but it is a very interesting way to film a historical film which is as much about our own misconceptions and limited views of history as History itself. It is narrated using the memoirs of the Duc d&#39;Orleans&#39; ex- mistress, Grace Elliott. So, an event usually claimed as one of their own by Marxist historians, especially in France, is here told from the point of view of a female aristocratic foreigner. Inevitably a different point of view emerges -there can be no objective representation. The use of the memoirs device does give the film a rather episodic quality. Personally, I found the story line around the King&#39;s death the most interesting. A staunch Royalist she is shocked when the Duc votes for the King&#39;s death (a basic knowledge of the French Revolution is probably helpful to follow the dialogue between Grace and the Duc here. He was Louis&#39;s cousin and had himself elected to the Assembly, where he promptly changed his name to Philip Equality). The filming of Louis&#39;s death is masterly. Grace and her maidservant are in Meudon, out of Paris, watching from a hill with a telescope. We do not see the execution, we only hear the maid&#39;s commentary, like Grace. The most dramatic event of the Revolution happens off screen. Grace cannot bear to watch her king be killed. Her view is that of an aristocrat. Any justification of Louis&#39;s death is literally beyond her vision. This is powerful, keenly intelligent film making. The love story between the duc and Grace is insinuated, never told, and is powerfully moving (tho the Duc does seem a bit of a pompous fool at times; what does she see in him? No accounting for taste). The undercurrents of madness (simply existing being enough to be a suspect) that sweep individuals along in a time such as the Revolution are illustrated as Grace&#39;s life is turned upside down, her house is searched daily, yet she still orders her servants to cook her food and is incapable of dressing herself! If you have any interest at all in a subtle, well told film, making clever use of new technology to tell an old tale, or the representation of a pivotal moment in Europe&#39;s history narrated by an aristocratic foreign woman, its ultimate outsider, then this is well worth your time. It is a little slow in places but your patience is amply rewarded.

There I was on vacation when my host suggested we take in this B-Movie festival in Breda. I was resistant, as I hadn&#39;t gone on the trip to sit in a movie theater, but I&#39;ve got to admit that I don&#39;t regret a second of this one (especially with Stephen Malkmus&#39; contribution). It probably helped that I had no idea what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEA OF DUST starts out like a typical costume drama. We&#39;ve got a young medical student going to help a doctor whose town is being destroyed by a crazy plague (which somehow involves exploding heads). On the way, he stops to visit his fiancé and gets thrown off the property by her father. Traveling on, he finds a girl lying on the road, another plague victim, and takes her along to the doctor&#39;s. Yawn, I thought. It all seemed pretty predicable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then everything went crazy and it suddenly turned into a completely different film. Tom Savini shows up looking like Dracula, characters begin traveling to &#34;the other side&#34; of reality, and the dialog gets increasingly humorous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just when I thought it had settled into a groove, the picture changes again, becoming really dark and bizarre. I won&#39;t spoil it for first time viewers, but there&#39;s an amazing sequence about hollow people, lots of chat about the abuse of religion by society, and some over-the-top gore effects. And did I mention Stephen Malkmus? This isn&#39;t a perfect movie (in case you haven&#39;t figured that out from its appearance at a B-Movie festival), but it&#39;s well worth the time for adventurous viewers. Great visuals, cool soundtrack, lots of interesting ideas. The acting is a little zany at times, but I think that&#39;s the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny I had to go to Breda to see find an American picture that looked like a British horror movie. You figure that one out...

I swear I didn&#39;t mean to! I picked this out only since it looked good on the back! This movie wasn&#39;t scary at all and actually was very confusing. The demon wind was only actually used a couple of times and people were killed off pretty cheesily. The one major bright spot was seeing Sherri Bendorf from Slaughterhouse play in it. Seeing what happened to her, however, made up my mind for this little turkey of a film. A 3 out of 10. NEXT!

so, i won&#39;t disagree with the critics but I really was not all that moved by this movie. i was a little hesitant to rent it,as I am going through some of the same things the protagonist is supposed to be experiencing. yet, i did rent it thinking that I might experience some catharsis, or at the least understand that I am not alone. while i understood the protagonist&#39;s irritation with his careless cousin, I didn&#39;t feel his internal struggle with isolation as much as I would have liked. i felt that much more emphasis was placed on his disruptive cousin overstaying his welcome. it is a beautifully filmed movie, and I did really appreciate the use of silence to bring out the feeling of isolation.

at a Saturday matinee in my home town. I went with an older friend (he was about 12) and my mom let me go because she thought the film would be OK (it&#39;s rated G). I was assaulted by loud music, STRANGE images, no plot and a stubborn refusal to make ANY sense. We left halfway through because we were bored, frustrated and our ears hurt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it 22 years later in a revival theatre. My opinion had changed--it&#39;s even WORSE! Basically everything I hated about it was still there and the film was VERY 60s...and has dated badly. I got all the little in-jokes...too bad they weren&#39;t funny. The constant shifts in tone got quickly annoying and there&#39;s absolutely nothing to get a firm grip on. Some people will love this. I found it frustrating...by the end of the film I felt like throwing something heavy at the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, all the Monkees songs in this movie SUCK (and I DO like them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For ex-hippies only...or if you&#39;re stoned. I give this a 1.

The author sets out on a &#34;journey of discovery&#34; of his &#34;roots&#34; in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the (completely and deservedly forgotten) movie &#34;Bright Leaf&#34; is about an ancestor of his. Its not, and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and self-indulgent glorified home movie, suitable for screening at (the director&#39;s) drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial - or even non-commercial release. A good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios - because they are boring, irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and his/her immediate circles. Avoid at all costs!

This movie was like a gathering of people that had been in other movies and they decided to make a really bad movie. It had a dude from &#34;Detroit Rock City&#34;, a girl from &#34;The Cosby Show&#34;, that dork that kissed the chick and bought that sausage was in &#34;Sorority Boys&#34; and there was more. OK that doesn&#39;t make a bad movie in itself, that was just something I noticed. The whole thing with the hooker and the french girl having the same name was dumb and the thing with 37 people writing these notes and if you think they are going to get mixed up.....shocking enough.......you called it. And the purse thing, that was just plain stupid. It was so bad that I watched the movie in two parts and still only made it to the 50 minute mark. If you are watching this and expect &#34;Van Wilder&#34; or a movie like that......Don&#39;t.

Gamera vs Viras was made lazily and much of it suffers as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Space Aliens try to take over Earth and are stopped by Gamera. So they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys. The aliens then take control of Gamera and get him to attack mankind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all I must say that I really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between Gamera and Viras. Viras looks like a big squid with a beak. He has no energy weopons and does not shoot any rays out but he can close the apendages on top of his head to make a sharp pointy weopon. SO overall this is not a bad monster for Gamera to fight and is decent. Viras really injures Gamera badly by stabbing his underside of his shell with his pointy head and I am surprised Gamera was able to survive this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately Gamera vs Viras decided to use footage from previous Gamera films to fill time for this film. They re show the battles between Gamera and Barugon and Gamera and Gaos when the aliens look at Gameras past battles. However when they show Gamera&#39;s battles with Gaos they show the battle between Gamera and Gaos in the city first, then they show the final battle between the two. After they show re used footage of the final battle between Gamera and Gaos they show the FIRST battle between Gamera and Gaos!!! Talk about showing the battles in non chronological order. THey did not even need to show the first battle they should have just stopped after they showed the final battle between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is that they decide to re show footage of Gamera attacking cities when the aliens order him to attack Tokyo. So they show the scene from &#34;Gamera vs Barugon&#34; where he destroys the Dam. After the show scenes from &#34;Gamera The Invincible&#34; which is a huge issue for me. Mainly due to the fact that &#34;Gamera The Invincible&#34; was in BLACK AND WHITE!!!! Using stock footage from a black and white film in a COLOR film is really lazy and that is not a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the dubbing is bad once again. The two little kids are not that annoying but it would be nice to see a Gamera film that did not involve little kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the over use of footage from other Gamera Films is a deterrant to this film. The final fight is awesome so basically I recommend skipping to the final ten minutes and watching this film. The rest is something that has already been seen before.

This show is painful to watch ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show, from the ever changing &#34;jobs&#34;, boyfriends, and cast. It appears that they wanted to cast Amanda Bynes in something ... but had no idea what, and came up with this crappy show. They cast her as a teen, surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings, and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy. Soon, they realize that she needs a &#34;clique&#34; and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me. Somehow, ABC has now decided that it is a &#34;family&#34; show, and thrown it into it&#39;s afternoon lineup on ABC Family.

Disney has yet to meet a movie it couldn&#39;t make at least two sequels about. And this one was no exception to the people at Disney to give a weak story to receive a quick reward. Somehow, although I did not pay to view it, I feel cheapened by watching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ariel is grown up now and had a daughter. Yet doesn&#39;t allow the daughter to go into the sea because of some idle threat made by the sister of the deceased sea-witch. So here we go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daughter is tricked (of course) and helps the sea-witch. After a not-so-glorious battle, she is defeated and the mermaids and humans live in harmony. Yawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing to view here. Go back to your lives. &#34;D-&#34;

I vowed some time ago to never get another Joe Castro film (perhaps after &#34;Near Death&#34;) but I sort of ended up with this one by accident, since it was a Troma release &amp; I didn&#39;t read the cover carefully. Oops. Well, I watched it, and it&#39;s by no means good, but it&#39;s, I guess, sort of &#34;tongue in cheek&#34;....if it&#39;s not, it sure seemed that way. Some intrepid folks from the University of the Rio Grande set out to find if the Chupacabra exists, because of surveillance camera footage from someone&#39;s GOAT BARN that shows this weird thing hopping across the field of vision. And also because the person that this thing supposedly killed was the uncle of the leader of the expedition. There&#39;s a couple of camera men, one of whom whines the whole time, and there some ex-Marine named &#34;Army&#34; (?!), who is some kind of munitions expert or something. At any rate, the do find the Chupacabra on some guy&#39;s ranch &amp; set out to find it, getting involved with two supposed witches along the way. The creature itself is rather ridiculous-looking, with spines on its back &amp; a great big long tongue that Gene Simmons would die for. Eventually, after a bunch of folks done get killed, so does the Chupacabra, and they take it back to the university for an autopsy. So, is it from another planet? Is it a genetic creation from some lab in Puerto Rico? Uh, they don&#39;t tell us, really. Not exactly intriguing but not quite terrible either. Definitely not a wide audience for this one. 4 out of 10.

So we compromised. This was a fairly charming film, I liked the art direction (it felt far more &#34;real&#34; than most kids movies), and the costumes weren&#39;t too cutesy. The child actors were not bad to watch (the adult performances trended toward cheesy). It was great that they showed how a bullied kid bullies others as well as kids standing up to bullying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know how many grown ups would want to see this for themselves, but it&#39;s a great film to take a kid to. And since &#34;Barnyard&#34; was apparently attended by 100+ kids at the same time, I&#39;m REALLY glad we picked the sparsely attended showing of &#34;worms&#34; instead.

I really enjoyed this movie. Yes there was disrespect throughout the movie, but Bruce Willis learned, from The Kid, that there is more value in repecting others, and his life of disrespect needs to change. This movie was a refreshing change from the trash that Hollywood is trying to shove down our throats. There are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie. I really believe this was one of Disneys best, even though a couple of things could have been left out. I was impressed with the lack of swearing and lack of sexual inuendos. It isn&#39;t perfect, but much better than most everything else out there.

I think the movie was one sided I watched it recently and find the documentary typical of western movie makers that was biased without substance. The fact is prostitution do exist everywhere in the world not in Tanzania alone and not because of this fish business, there prostitutes were there way before the Russian and other business people arrived in Mwanza. Poverty is indeed endemic in Africa let alone Tanzania and this is not because of fish fillet business, in fact the fish industry has helped millions to support their families on their daily life. This movie just tarnish the good image of this peace loving country. As for the arms trade the film could not substantiate if there is any truth in that indeed looking critically at the films one is doubting the authenticity of the film maker, it seems that their trying to prove their point by using a few characters which can be done for anything really. Yes Tanzania is a poor country yes there are prostitutes and street children but they are not the product this business, it is just a common scenario in most poor countries indeed the world over even in the western world...What a load of rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pilot themselves are talking of sending weapons to Angola which is more than 2000km south of Tanzania and the war was in DRC also miles away from Mwanza, the director could not give evidence how these weapons were transported from Mwanza to DRC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short the films lacks focus and respectability, it is quite easy to find the character anywhere in Africa and has nothing to do Darwin&#39;s nightmare or fish fillet...What a load of rubbish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is the Nile perch has not decimated all other species in the lake contrary to what the movie portrays and also less than 25% of all catches from lake Victoria are exported the rest is consumed locally so lets get that one right.

A surprising rent at a local video store, I was pleased to find a media satire worthy enough to challenge Oliver Stone&#39;s &#34;Natural Born Killers.&#34; And almost as disturbing. I think it went well with my viewing to be in late 2004 watching the Republican Machine do it&#39;s magic on the majority of America&#39;s television viewing populous. It brings up the question &#34;Are we really that manipulative?&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely skewed my view. There was also a larger theological question being provoked- the story of Christ. Could word of mouth and overwhelming dependence on something exploitive as television produce a messiah? Could the story of Christ been exaggerated? Could it have been completely fabricated? It&#39;s something the movie puts in a extremely perceptive light.

i got to see the whole movie last night and i found it very exciting.it was at least,not like the teen-slasher movies that pop out every now and then.the search for the killer and the &#39;partner&#39; relationship between the hero&amp;the so-called bad guy was parts i liked about the movie.also,i remember once being on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the movie.i mean it&#39;s exciting.maybe some time later,i might watch the movie again...

First of all I just want to say that I LOVE this show!!! But this episode...this episode makes a mockery of the entire show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the WORST episode in the entire series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no story line, everything is chaotic and the jokes.....are crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game..... For example &#34;how do the furlings look like&#34; by creating that stupid &#34;previously on...&#34;......is simply embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad.

What an amazingly funny and original show. The cast starting with the hysterical Julie Brown(Homecoming Queen&#39;s Got A Gun) is just perfect. Add Amy Hill(All American Girl-Grandma Kim) who plays a lesbian who is always arguing with her partner and business partner(Asian restaurant-WOK-DON&#34;T RUN) I have laughed harder during this show than any other I have ever seen(including Newhart-one of my all time favorite shows) If you like movies like Naked Gun and Airplane- you will love this series!! One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Williams playing herself. When she snubs Tammy at the dry cleaners, Tammy finds a picture of Cindy Williams in her coat. The picture is of Cindy Williams doing an unmentionable act with a bowling pin-upside down. It is awesome to see an actress like Cindy Williams being able to play herself like this. Soap opera like with many surprise twists during its short run. I can only hope that this will someday be released on DVD with special many bonus special features. Funniest series I have ever seen!!!!

Okay first of all, I didn&#39;t sit down to watch the premier of a &#34;Star Trek&#34; Series to see a cowboy flying around in space. this is how a normal Enterprise episode works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Archer finds a nebula or something aloung the lines of that and wants to take a closer look but it might destroy the ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 he sends a shuttle into the nebula and and the shuttle get damaged...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in all of the episodes I have seen, all of the problems are happening because of Archer&#39;s stupid mistakes. Oh and did you see the preview of one episode showing Archer and T&#39;pol kissing?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was planning to watch that episode but after that I totally gave up on Enterprise and turned to TV right off. Come on!!!! This is star trek!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also what was with the banana slug?? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana slug but had to leave it behind for some stupid reason. Okay fine, little dumb to bring you pet slug in space but whatever. Okay that was what I thought until they left it on a desert planet!!!!! A BANANA SLUG CANNOT LEAVE IN A DESERT!!!!!!!!!!!! How dumb are these writers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any ways, just saying if Enterprise is on DON&#39;T WATCH IT!!!!!

When all we have anymore is pretty much reality TV shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason be it too fat or can&#39;t sing or cook worth a damn than I know Hollywood has run out of original ideas. I can not recall a time when anything original or intelligent came out on TV in the last 15 years. What is our obsession with watching bums make fools of themselves? I would have thought these types of programs would have run full circle but every year they come up with something new that is more strange then the one before. OK so people in this one need to lose weight...most Americans need to lose weight. I just think we all to some degree enjoy watching people humiliated. Maybe it makes us feel better when we see someone else looking like a jerk. I don&#39;t know but I just wish something intelligent would come out that did not insult your intelligence.

Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X--a powerful force to be used for atomic power. Unfortunately Rukh has been contaminated by the Radium and starts to glow in the dark--and his touch causes instant death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) develops an antidote--but Rukh starts to go mad due to the Radium AND the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is silly and the &#34;effects&#34; that make Karloff glow in the dark are laughable, but this is still a fun little chiller. It moves quickly, has some great atmosphere (notice Rukh&#39;s &#34;house&#34; and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give great performances. There is also good acting by Franic Drake (as Rukh&#39;s wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So it&#39;s OK but just a notch below all the other Karloff/Lugosi movies. The plot is just too far-fetched for me to swallow. Still I did like this. I give it a 7.

I had first watched this several years ago on a now-defunct Sicilian TV channel; amazingly, the film emerged as a heftily-priced DVD from Criterion: not being sure what I had made of it initially (despite having attained cult status over the years, the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs), I opted not to make the purchase  as I did with the similar and, to me, unfamiliar FIEND WITHOUT A FACE (1958). Recently, however, I managed to acquire THE BLOB via a copy of the Spanish DVD which, interestingly, ported over the two Audio Commentary tracks from the Criterion &#34;Special Edition&#34;but, regrettably, I could not switch off the Spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature! Anyway, looking at the film anew, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it (despite many a narrative flaw, which I will get to later)  as a pure example of &#39;B-movie&#39; schlockiness (atypically shot in pleasant color) and a time-capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes. The male lead was an early role for Steve(n) McQueen and, though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain, his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging: not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent (and, more importantly, altruistic) kid. The special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period; the film itself rises to a good climax  beginning with the monster&#39;s invasion of a cinema (showing DAUGHTER OF HORROR [1953/7] as I mentioned recently in that film&#39;s review but being curiously screened &#39;flipped&#39; and which sequence, incidentally, would be featured at the opening of a satirical Italian program actually called &#34;Blob&#34;!). As to the admittedly minor quibbles I have with the film: the monster is not shown traveling  it just turns up at a variety of places, never being seen by anyone!; there is a baffling over-emphasis (tantamount to padding) on the kids&#39; scrapes with Police; it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at The Blob  as if fluid, whatever its proportion, can be destroyed by bullets!; equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door-to-door visits (especially when considering that, at that stage, only McQueen had actually seen the monster in action)! An inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called BEWARE THE BLOB!; the original was then remade in 1988  I watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me (though I know Micheal Elliott loves it). For the record, I will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director Yeaworth and producer Jack H. Harris, namely 4D MAN (1959) and DINOSAURUS! (1960).

This...... Movie.... Is..... Horrible!!!!!! You won&#39;t believe this hunk of junk is even a movie!!!! Critters4 was better then this!!! And Critters4 was pretty frigging bad too!!! A bunch of stupid teens crash in a desert, find an old run down bungalow, and end up fending off horrifically badly stop motion animated spiders. Pardon my french, but the acting was bad as hell!!! The person who wrote this probably didn&#39;t even know what a spider is, because he had the spiders living in a colony serving an alien-queen-ripoff queen spider! SPIDERS DO NOT LIVE IN COLONIES!!!!!!!!! THIS &#34;MOVIE&#34; IS A PIECE OF CRUD!!! At the end, the marines suddenly pop out of no where and kill all the spider without even being called!!!! If you see a copy of this movie at a video store, douse it in gasoline and throw a match at it!!!!

Ham-handed homage to honest hacking. Felt good in a soft-core way about equivalent to its mild pornography, until its vapid lack of technical and economic reality, emotional and moral sophistication became apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically a muddled &#39;90s remake of &#39;85&#39;s &#34;Real Genius&#34;, with fewer and stupider geniuses, and a cynical bad ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this movie would appeal to someone delighted by the thesis that becoming a billionaire is so easy it&#39;s almost accidental. Or perhaps to technical types who like seeing themselves depicted as cool and sexy. Speculating about the reasons someone might like this movie is certainly more interesting than the movie itself. The movies closing credits song is more interesting than the movie itself.

John Knowles modern masterpiece, A Separate Peace, are one of many subtle, and subtly is the watch word, themes of love, hate, jealously, denial and regret. The 1972 version does attempt to address this style and what the book is - A love story with war looming in the background. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2004 version does not use subtly at all but overtness in the portrayal of the story. What is staring you in the face when you read the novel - is a love story, and yes maybe it is arguable, a gay love story. In the novel and 1972 film version there are sexual undertones everywhere in the writings and dialog.In the 2004 Showtime film version these tensions were omitted and the actors were in there late twenties playing teenagers which caused for mature acting taking away from any tenderness or hesitation of innocence in youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not like this remake for more reasons. The hair that broke the camels&#39; back was that Phineas was given a surname on the letters he received from the draft boards! Finny is a character that does not have nor needs a last name. John Knowles did that intentionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I accept the 1972 version the acting was at times a little amateurish, so what, it attempted to be sincere to the novel by shooting on location at Phillips Exeter Academy that The Devon Acedemy was based on; which also the writer John Knowles attended as a student.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directors and producers took all teenage Exeter students, with exception of Parker Stevenson whom attended The Brooks School, to play in a Paramount Film! Class act by preppies compared to this Canadian College shot, played with adult actors, politically correct, platonic version. No - Veto on this sham try again. The 1972 film version with John Heyl and Parker Stevenson was the real deal for A Separate Peace on the screen. The Showtime 2004 film made for cable version was not.

This was without a doubt the worst thing I have ever spent money on. I feel dirty for admitting that I rented this &#39;movie&#39; and actually paid money to see it. This does not even rate trash. No no. This is the juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumpsters located in particularly foul neighborhoods after an extraordinarily humid summer. To call it trash would be to degrade trash everywhere. It was so bad I felt I had to register at IMDb and warn my fellow man. This luvahire character claims this movie is great. One has to question his grasp on reality. Let&#39;s take some of his comments and analyze them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a VERY good job.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see. Well, if the director envisioned his audience cringing and wincing at every sentence uttered by Ricky or alternately bursting into uncontrollable laughter at moments when most directors would want a more somber reaction from their viewers, then yes; Ricky did an outstanding job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;I&#39;m an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and I had to do a play where I had to cry and it&#39;s not easy to be emotional in a scene so I give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. I too must give props to actors who can pull off emotional scenes. Luvahire, you may want to look into another line of work there buddy if you think these chuckleheads pulled it off. Still, they can help you if you need to practice crying. Just watch the movie. ha. ha. ha. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;BRING ON THE SEQUEL&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was your theater teacher at school I&#39;d fail you based solely on this comment alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am too disgusted to continue. I shall now turn over the movie bashing to my associate, Mr. Bangla. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Howdy! If you&#39;ve continued to read this far, I take it for granted that you&#39;ve already seen the movie, and you&#39;re now looking for one of two things in this comment: 1) Additional vitriolic debasement of what you agree was an exceptionally poor movie. 2) Additional vitriolic debasement of what you feel was a good cinematic effort which needs defending against such libelous scum as myself. Whether you want help articulating your disgust or ammunition for a stirring repartee, if I say anything good it&#39;ll only disappoint you--so let me assure you, there is little chance of such disappointment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other negative comments here at IMDb have already enumerated the particular failings of the movie (e.g. the acting, the soundtrack, the directing, the dialogue, the editing, etc.), however all of these faults can readily be forgiven, in and of themselves. Few people will rent a movie titled &#34;Hood of the Living Dead&#34; if they require these elements to be top-notch. The ultimate failure of &#34;Hood&#34;, however, is its failure to deliver on the abundant promise of its name. &#34;Hood of the Living Dead&#34; practically leaps off the shelf at the video store with its implications of corny one-liners and gruesomely creative kills. Here was a chance to mix the cheesy gore of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto, to have gangsta-thug zombies bombin&#39; on the innocent living while rockin&#39; do-rags, to have undead pimps drivin&#39; over all-too-mortal po-lice in their tricked-out rides. The mixture of the two genres could have been hilarious. Instead, the movie is more like watching middle school kids timidly deliver the lines to a play they are performing, but don&#39;t understand. To avoid a feeling of betrayal on the part of their video-rental audience, I suggest that the Quiroz brothers re-release the movie with the following new title: &#34;Hood of the Living Dead: A home-made horror video we shot on our camcorder with some friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored&#34;. Or perhaps they could release it as a documentary. &#34;The Day Creativity Died: An exploration of how a low budget movie can still be perfectly devoid of clever or original thought despite lacking ties to a major motion picture studio.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The potential renter whose interest has not been quelled, should find the following blurb on the back of the video case: &#34;The Quiroz Brothers have proved once again that watching things which you can easily do yourself is not very interesting.&#34;--Mr. Bangla

Second-feature concerns a young woman in London desperate for a job, happy to accept live-in secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son. Thrillers about people being held in a house against their will always make me a little uneasy--I end up feeling like a prisoner too--but this rather classy B-film is neither lurid nor claustrophobic. It&#39;s far-fetched and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is quick on her feet. Rehashing this in 1986 (as &#34;Dead Of Winter&#34;) proved not to be wise, as the plot-elements are not of the modern-day. &#34;Julia Ross&#34; is extremely compact (too short at 65 minutes!) but it stays the course nicely until a too-rushed climax, which feels a little sloppy. *** from ****

Tony Arzenta, a Sicilian hit-man or professional killer, decides to leave the business, and his former employers do not agree.In terms of content, this highly enjoyable action movie doesn&#39;t have one; in terms of sheer amusement, it is funit is very melodramatic, violent, quite brutal, the car chases are notable. &#34;Arzenta&#34; is an unpretentious ,yet very likable filmmuch better than the current Hollywoodian trash that gets the same label. It comes from Delon&#39;s rather short flirting with the Italian B cinema of the &#39;70s. It carefully uses Delon&#39;s tough guy persona, belonging to the gallery of bad-ass thugs that he made in his youth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed very much the fact that Delon made this film, that he had a role in a good Eurocrime flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The score is very fine, with a good introductory songmaking felt that gusto that the Italians had for the film considered as a synthetic work,where the musical art has an important part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Tony Arzenta/ Big Guns/ No Way Out the very appealing Erika Blanc (31 years in &#39;73) appears as an unnamed hooker.Meanwhile, Arzenta&#39;s girlfriend, Sandra,is played by Carla Gravina (a starlet that practically left the movies after &#39;75).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Arzenta&#34; is interestingly filmedan ambitious visual conception, some Expressionistic peculiar angles. The movie was directed by the prolific Duccio Tessari,the one who made also Zorro (the Delon comedy).Needless to mention that these two films,Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro ,are very unlike.The first one is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie--the second is a lighthearted comedy,more kindred to a spoof,though remarkably coherent and skilfully made.Duccio Tessari directed films like Kiss Kiss... Bang Bang (1966),Sons of Satan ,The Bloodstained Butterfly ,¡Viva La Muerte... Tua! ,Tough Guys (1974),Safari Express (1976) ,etc..

Several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this film. First, the scenery and special effects are incredible -- the best, and if everything else worked as well, its austere presence might have made it a great film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as soon as the actors open their mouths, you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your den watching a movie. The story itself is full of cleché and melodrama, and the dialogue is some of the worst I&#39;ve ever seen. And as if that weren&#39;t bad enough, they made a fool out of the protagonist, and in my experience, you don&#39;t want to do that unless the film is a comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I had a hard time getting into it, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.

Fun With Dick and Jane failed to entertain on so many levels. There were loose ends with the writing, for example, it seems as though one of the major conflicts was the indictment of Jim Carrey&#39;s character DIck Harper, but the writers never follow up that particular conflict. Basically the story is weak and mostly unfunny, but Carrey saves a few scenes with his physical humor, but honestly, Jim Carrey wasn&#39;t very funny in this movie, and Tea Leone might as well have been there just for her appearance because she wasn&#39;t funny either. This is just another example of Hollywood banking off franchise actors with a lousy unoriginal story.

I picked this DVD up at the Dollar Store. The DVD was on the 2 for $1 rack, but since it had Michael Madsen in it, I thought that since I had never seen the movie, I bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I didn&#39;t like the movie. The movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else. I found that the director&#39;s use of flashbacks did not add to the story line for me. I would have preferred to view the story line in chronological order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#39;t throw it away like one of the other commentators, but It may be quite awhile before I would consider watching this movie again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows, since it was Michael Madsen&#39;s film debut, maybe it might have some archival value at some future date.

I saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from NYC. After 30 minutes, I said to him,&#34; You&#39;ve got to be kidding. Is this some sort of joke?&#34; He thought it was good. I told him that I thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made. &#34;What was it supposed to be?&#34; I asked. &#34;A propaganda movie made for children?&#34; The plot is stupid. The acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life, love or even afterlife, of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view...need some psychiatric help. Please, if someone tries to get you to stick this in your DVD or Video player, consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computer...it won&#39;t destroy your player but it will destroy your evening. If they had made Razzies in the &#39;40s, this would have won in every category. (PS. It also goes under the dubious sobriquet of &#34;Stairway to Heaven.&#34;)

If the scale went negative I would be happier. Seeing Sushmita Sen was nice, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story. The choice of angles, choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story. Oh, if the songs and dances haven&#39;t caused you to rip your ears off your head, first. The film could have been made twice at 1.25 hours, and been pretty good, kinda like &#34;Seven Samurai&#34; but the director and writer didn&#39;t go that direction, even if the &#34;townsfolk&#34; finally find their backbone and want to help. This movie fails on so many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script - name any aspect of this film - it was BAD - probably the food from the caterer was bad too. I have never in 6 years of watching Indian (Bollywood) movies seen something this badly made.

House of Games is spell binding. It&#39;s so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens. There are few movies I&#39;ve seen that can grip you so quickly. From the opening scene this movie just gets you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a FEW SPOILERS SO DON&#39;T READ ANYMORE IF YOU DON&#39;T WANT TO KNOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say House of Games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists I have ever seen-bar none. From the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection, from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices. I also loved the way the movie was filmed, in that grainy, surreal type of way, it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few movies I&#39;ve seen and loved that this reminded me of including The Grifters and The usual Suspects but really, House of games is completely different in it&#39;s way. Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbing characters I&#39;ve seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet, but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying. You know something&#39;s going to happen but you have no idea what. And just when you think you&#39;ve guessed what the &#34;something&#34; is, you realize you haven&#39;t even scratched the surface....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;House of Games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature. The character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well. As the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters, we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it. It is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it&#39;s conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I&#39;d rank this 10 of 10, call it (although not my absolute favorite film, pretty high on the list), most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best &#34;twists&#34; I&#39;ve ever seen as well. Although I love all types and genres of movies, when it comes to movies of the human psyche, it really doesn&#39;t get much better then this. See this movie.

Final Score...who cares - it&#39;s a reality show. It has no love for it&#39;s audience, it panders to lazy TV viewers, puts nothing in and gets nothing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Joe Millionaire&#34;, the most blatantly phony reality show of them all, is a television disaster of epic proportions. It&#39;s a watershed, rock bottom moment, not only for Fox, but for the American viewing public who actually watch, like and talked about this crap the next day. You people ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Because as much as Fox promotes this junk it won&#39;t make any money unless it&#39;s watch by people (and boy was it, the finale got nearly Super Bowl numbers!?). It doesn&#39;t bother you people that there are many quality shows written, directed, acted and generally have effort put into them that are being cancelled while you sit back and lap up this effortless, cold game show?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to be a staunch supporter of Fox. It&#39;s those of us like me who like and seek out quality TV that helped build Fox back in the days of Married...with Children and The Simpsons. Conveniently enough, now neither of those shows would make it 6 weeks with the current management. The Gail Berman &#34;reign of terror&#34; as it&#39;s often called. The network has waged war on scripted TV AND, strangely enough, it&#39;s fans. The very people who helped build them in the beginning. Now, not only do we have to fight for good shows, but we have to fight against their own network. It boggles the mind. Nothing Fox, has done in the past 3 years makes any sense. From canceling hits like &#34;Titus&#34;, &#34;Futurama&#34; and &#34;John Doe&#34; (NBC can renew &#34;Boomtown&#34;, but Fox can&#39;t lift it&#39;s pitiful head to give the only decent show they had this season another shot?). And the reason they can do all this: the success of junk like &#34;Joe Millionaire&#34;. They can now say &#34;We don&#39;t need you TV fans, we have reality shows&#34;. They apparently seem to have no idea that the big audience the draw with this junk is fickle and WILL abandon them the second the next fad comes along. To alienate their base like this will eventually kill the network the way it has set back ABC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show itself is a joke. Here we have a premise, in the now classic Fox gimmick, that promises us something different and edgy, but then delivers something not in any way different from &#34;The Bachelor&#34; or anything on the big 3. Fox has gone mainstream. The finale and &#34;twist&#34; (quote/unquote) showed they have no ideas up their sleeve. Now we know that all these shows, no matter how different they look, will all end up the same cornball, fairy tale ending. We got to see a bunch of lame aspiring actors that the network picked out of millions of head-shots to fit their demographics parade around like high school bimbos pretending they liked this Evan Marriott because...well because it was a competition and that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do. Marriott himself is like a hideously disfigured Chro-magnum man who struggles to put together the simplest sentences. But, how can the women (all average to ugly looking by the way - an important minus is a guilty pleasure show like this) not fall for &#34;Joe&#34; with such charming lines like &#34;Look, you&#39;re not stupid&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to think that people who watched these reality/dating/game shows were just to lazy to change the channel, but after &#34;Joe Millionaire&#34; I think they must be genuinely mentally deficient. Come on people, have a little more pride in yourselves. Demand a little bit more from your entertainment then THIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boycott FOX.

Kudos to the writers of this film for creating a supremely engaging drama. The curious character development is indicative of a nuanced and well schooled writing team. The audience member cannot but help but to feel that (s)he must make wrenching emotional decisions pitting the cerebral against the libidinal. The viewer has an opportunity to develop the character herself, though her predictions are rarely validated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Credit is also due to the filmmakers for breathing life into the setting. The wood-shop is transformed into a unique persona as the film unfolds, with its own traits, faults, a variety of highly charged relationships, and of course a fate inexorably tied to that of the other principals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to catch this one at your local art-house.

Will there be please coming an end to hyping movies that are dealing about social conflicts or other human disasters? Okay &#34;Care&#34; is about childabuse, &#34;Care&#34; is about perverts misusing boys in a school and how disgusting it might be, if it&#39;s a movie with a poor script and made with bad playing actors then it stays a bad movie. &#34;Care&#34; is a movie that could have been, but is it because it was a tvmovie I don&#39;t know but everything seemed so limited that it comes over as some cheap movie that will be seen by some housewifes and fathers who decide not to go to bed. There are so many unanswered things in this movie...the relation with his mother for instance or the death of some abused boy from which we know nothing more. &#34;Care&#34; should have been much much better.

And Gi Joe go stuck in the water, I die of laufther every time I see this movie, and then a big brown shark came, This is comedy at it&#39;s best, this blows away the kings of comedy and anyone else, Andrew Dice Clay, Jerry, Tucker, Rock, They can&#39;t thouch the man the myth the legend Eddie Murphy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yo EDDIE WE WANT MORE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After some difficulty, Johnny Yuma arrives at his ailing uncle&#39;s ranch to take over day to day operations, only to find out that the old man has been murdered by his beautiful gold-digger wife and the woman&#39;s vicious brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good production values, a likable performance by Mark Damon, and a breezy action packed script combine to make this an entertaining, if not exceptionally deep, above average addition to the spaghetti western genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Co-star Rosalba Neri is one of the hottest European babes ever to grace the screen. Here she&#39;s absolutely perfect as the cold-hearted user (and abuser) of weak men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damon and Neri appeared together in at least one other picture, The Devil&#39;s Wedding Night, a pretty good horror movie that&#39;s of particular interest for those of you that want to see what&#39;s underneath Rosalba&#39;s dresses.

This is one strange hacked together film, you get the feeling that the bond company had to come in on this one, I&#39;m not surprised there&#39;s no credits on it, who would want to be associated with this film. The Acting of all involved is terribly stilted and the plot jumps around all over, it all makes very little sense. As I said before it looks like the bond company had to come in because it seems like there was alot of footage that wasn&#39;t shot that needed to be, and all the music was very ill-fitting library music (cheap I guess). Very, very odd. I might actually buy a DVD of it though, if it could let me in on what the hell was going on, and what happened to this movie.

What I&#39;ve seen of Wolfgang Petersen&#39;s films has been pretty good. He knows how to direct action, create suspense and get you interested. Eastwood tends to be great, sometimes excellent. This goes for both his acting and his directing. They both hand in solid work here. The concept isn&#39;t bad, and the cat-and-mouse game works well. Malkovich performs rather well, and his and Eastwood&#39;s playing off each other adds to the film. I suppose this won&#39;t introduce anything new, really... but it never really claims to, nor needs to. It&#39;s two great actors, each playing a basic type of role that they have proved at other points in their careers that they can manage remarkably well, and with a magnificent director at the helm. Really, it&#39;s entertaining, well-done, and it just plain delivers. Editing and cinematography are good. Acting and character writing is, as well. The film manages to be suspenseful and intense, and if you let yourself, you will probably be entertained and engaged, even if there are superior films out there. The pacing is pretty much spot-on. I recommend this to any fan of the principal actors, the director and/or this type of film. 7/10

Maybe I&#39;m biased because the F-16 is my favorite fighter aircraft - although the F-14 is probably second or third - but I liked this movie. The sequels (Iron Eagle II and III) don&#39;t measure up acting and plot wise, but the first one - along with Top Gun - have excellent flying and music, along with reasonable plots and acting. II and III clearly have much less of a &#34;flight budget&#34;, but their main drawback is plot and acting. I suspect the relative fame and popularity of Iron Eagle compared to Top Gun is almost entirely a reflection of the fame and popularity of Jason Gedrick compared to Tom Cruise. Another plus (for me) is an all too brief appearance by Shawnee Smith. 7/10

Early talkie feature based on a popular stage play. A murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a séance to see who the murderer is. While the lights are out there&#39;s ANOTHER murder...so it&#39;s someone in that room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is an obvious, dull and creaky murder mystery. Most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree. They act like they&#39;re on stage (where you have to overdo things) and it looks silly on screen. Most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before &#34;Dracula&#34;) who REALLY overdoes it as a police inspector. Static direction by Tod Browning (who was always overrated) doesn&#39;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Browning and Lugosi completists only. I give it a 3.

Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning. First Pachelbel&#39;s Canon brought a lump to my throat, then the sight of a Tiger Moth (which my grandfather, my father and I have all flown) produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then Crowe&#39;s name hooked me completely. I was entranced by this film, Crowe&#39;s performance (again), the subject matter (and yes, what a debt we owe), how various matters were addressed and dealt with, the flying sequences (my father flew Avro Ansons, too), the story - and, as another contributor pointed out, Crowe&#39;s recitation of High Flight. I won&#39;t spoil the film for anyone, but, separated from my wife by 4,000-odd miles, as an ex-army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot, I admit to crying heartily a couple of times. Buy it, rent it, download it, beg, borrow or steal it - but watch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Did I spy a Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colours)on the ground? Looked like a twin-engine aircraft with a twin-.303 Brownings in a dorsal turret.

Henry Sala&#39;s &#34;Nightmare Weekend&#34; is a rotten piece of sludge from Troma.This is a juvenile,sloppy and stupid low-budget horror film about some teenage girls spending the weekend at a mansion.The professor&#39;s evil assistant lures the girls into a bizarre scheme to perform hideous experiments.Using a brain implant she transforms her victims and their dates into zombies.&#34;Nightmare Weekend&#34; is a completely braindead piece of garbage that features lots of nudity and some cheesy gore,not to mention a laughable musical score.The acting is horrendous and the script is utterly incoherent.Why such piece of crap is widely distributed is beyond me.Avoid it like the plague.1 out of 10.

Wow this was a great Italian &#34;ZOMBIE&#34; movie by two great director&#39;s Luci Fulci (&#34;ZOMBIE&#34;) and Bruno Mattie (&#34;HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD&#34;) Lucio started this movie and was ill so the great Bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than I expected it to turn out so if you have seen &#34;HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD&#34; directed by Bruno Mattie and if you saw &#34;ZOMBIE&#34; directed by Lucio Fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great &#34;ZOMBIE&#34; make-up witch equals great looking &#34;ZOMBIES&#34; has a funny &#34;ZOMBIE&#34; flying head!And &#34;ZOMBIE&#34; birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a &#34;ZOMBIE&#34; (That Only Happed To Two People) but they are mainly just the great toxic &#34;ZOMBIES&#34; like in Bruno Matties &#34;HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD&#34;.So if you like Italian &#34;ZOMBIE&#34; movies or just &#34;ZOMBIE&#34; movie&#39;s in general than check this one out its a great Italian &#34;ZOMBIE&#34; movie!

I loved the first Grudge, I watched it in an empty theater,and in all honesty, I was freaked out. Never before had I heard the unique audio of chilling sounds, it truly was gripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Grudge 2 however, had a couple of good jumps, but the story line was real messy, and not entirely believable, and all over the place, with a couple of scenes, (like a female urinating herself out of fear, or another one of a young woman drinking a jug of milk then vomiting it all up again) which really made no sense, and did not help to enhance the creep factor of the film. During these scenes, and a couple of others, people in the sold out audience actually laughed out loud. That was a good indicator to show how this film lacked the thrills, chills, or creeps. The acting was decent, the emotions portrayed were believable, so hats off to the actors, but the cluttered storyline and its lack of direction was something I couldn&#39;t shake throughout the entire movie. I was annoyed more than anything, same old grudge gagging noises, a couple of quick unexpected scenes to make me jump, but overall, I was very disappointed.

A very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. As a child of divorced parents I was totally relating to events in the film. Also - a really cool zombie twist which I thought was VERY ORIGINAL. I&#39;m tired of the same old stuff in movies.

I saw it at a German press screening. Without giving too much away: Most critics really seemed to like it very much. There was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for that species. From my point of view and until now, it was the funniest movie of the year. It keeps the charm and wit of the three W+G shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies. Of course, there are obvious allusions to monster- and werewolf-movies, especially to &#34;An American Werewolf in London&#34;, &#34;Jaws&#34;, &#34;King Kong&#34; and even to Peter Jackson&#39;s &#34;Braindead&#34;/&#34;Dead Alive&#34;, but also to other genres.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Characterization was better done in &#34;Chicken Run&#34;, but that movie had a complete new &#34;cast&#34; where introduction was necessary. Here, you are already able to know the two main characters. So, the new &#34;Wallace and Gromit&#34;-movie is enjoyed best if you watched (and liked) the shorts already, yet it also works on its own. &#34;Chicken Run&#34; had the more convenient, but also more &#34;storytelling&#34; plot. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more &#34;isolated&#34; feeling of the W+G shorts. Children should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, this is a must-see for you!!!) and because Gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show (children also love dogs... :-) ). But many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual allusions in it). The movie manages, like &#34;Shrek 1+2&#34; and &#34;The Incredibles&#34;, to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family, with adding a British and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of American animated movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The animation is  as expected  superb, and they kept true to the Aardman style because they didn&#39;t put in too many digital effects - I realized just a few when it came to Wallace&#39;s inventions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the score works fine in the movie, although one of the main themes definitely is &#34;borrowed&#34; by Randy Edelman&#39;s &#34;Dragonheart&#34; score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing is: It will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from Nick Park &amp; Co.

I recently got THE SEVEN-UPS on video and I must say it was a very enjoyable movie. Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are great as the cop and crook respectively and a young Richard Lynch is great as psycho henchman Moon. The late Bill Hickman is pretty good as his associate Bo and sets up a brilliant car chase sequence which will have you on the edge of your seats. The other three members of the Seven-Ups team are pretty bland but that&#39;s only to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m glad that a lot of people on this site have supported this movie. I think it should be a film that should be released on DVD and not just forgotten. I certainly enjoyed every minute of it. The final scene between the two leads is excellent as the bad guy must face the consequences of his actions. THE SEVEN-UPS does not disappoint.

Originally, the Spiders was planned as a four-part serial, and it shows. I dislike serials; they&#39;re typically ridiculous, convoluted and banal. This one is no exception. In the first part of the Spiders, &#39;The Golden Lake,&#39; a rich adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminals--the Spiders--to steal gold from Incas. A silly love triangle ensues, with some Cowboys and Indians action. The sensationalism and exotica of it didn&#39;t entertain me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can legitimately trace themes from this two-part series to Lang&#39;s later, far superior work. And, the film-making is better than in other serials I&#39;ve seen from this time, including &#39;Les Vampires&#39; (1915). In the Spiders, the camera isn&#39;t as static, and this film is fast paced, thankfully. The tinting and lighting are adequate, too. None of that&#39;s remarkable, though. It&#39;s nearly unseemly, however, in how closely this series resembles Louis Feuillade&#39;s serials; the criminal gang dresses and behaves like those in &#39;Les Vampires&#39;--only the names, and to a lesser extent, the situations have changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the further comments on The Spiders series, see the web pages for it.

I had some reservations about this movie, I figured it would be the usual bill of fare --- a formula movie about Christmas. Being in the middle of a heat wave in late June, we decided to give it a shot anyway, maybe we would see some snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie turned out to be one laugh after another. Ben Affleck was believable in his character, but the real star of this one is James Gandofini. He delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great &#34;dad&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours, definitely check this one out.

I think that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit that to the fullest. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are state of the art, but from a scientific point of view it just doesn&#39;t work. Hydrogen filled flying bladders? They would need to be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. And then there&#39;s the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, just don&#39;t try to pass it off as fact. Some folks will always misunderstand. All in all the film is entertaining, but I constantly found myself saying &#34;oh brother, what a load of ....&#34;. If you want a FAKE documentary, watch This Is Spinal Tap instead. Or at the very least turn the sound off.

A horrible, horrible, horrible film. I saw the original when I was a kid and it gave me nightmares into my teens. When I found out a remake was on the way, I groaned. WHY OH WHY remake a good film? Well, we can thank Dark Castle for buggering yet another classic horror film. This time they&#39;ve replaced a somewhat interesting story with gore, slower than slow pacing, and yawn-inspired characters. Someone previously said that s/he was surprised that Paris Hilton can act. Uh, were you watching the film? She plays a prissy little tramp. Sounds like typecasting to me. Half of the people in the audience actually CHEERED when she died! That tells you why people are seeing this film. If that&#39;s your only reason, then find a better one, because like a black hole this thing will suck out more of your life than you&#39;ll want. Had I been alone, I would have left 10 minutes into the boring exposition. This thing is like a moron&#39;s guide to crap film-making: In bred Southern git, stupid but attractive leads, knives a plenty, gore a plenty, stock menacing truck, I could go on. After watching this film, I began to really appreciate Jeepers Creepers, and I thought that film sucked. Save yourself and avoid this crapfest at every cost.

An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed. I&#39;m not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a &#34;stiff-upper-lip&#34; attitude towards tragedy. His wife Anne (Emily Watson), who is twenty years younger than her husband, is more emotional, more impulsive, and more prone to drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man who really spices up life in this sleepy village is playboy millionaire William Bule, played by a deliciously devilish Rupert Everett (most American audiences will eternally remember him as Julia Roberts&#39; gay friend who completely stole every scene in My Best Friend&#39;s Wedding). In Separate Lies, Everett is cruel, cold, and selfish, but he&#39;s an absolute blast on screen. No, it&#39;s not that exciting of a movie title (Separate Lies  how did they end up with that lame and forgettable title? Did they just not have a marketing team? Did they just now care about getting people to see this film?), but beyond the title is a heartbreaking drama about the power of forgiveness.

Partially from the perceived need, one feels, to include a conventional love story in the plot to make the film more marketable to a 1950&#39;s movie-going public. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film starts with some wickedly funny characterizations of the upper-class bureaucrats running the Foreign Office --- the British are pilloried in the way that only the British can pillory themselves. But after that, the film loses its way in a conventional farcical plot. Terry-Thomas watchable as always, but the great talent in the cast (Peter Sellers, et al) is largely wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A diverting, but not great film.

Another FRIDAY THE 13TH ripoff, even featuring some of its music! A group of young adults get together for a small high school reunion and start getting slaughtered a la Jason Voorhees. Could it be that nerd they used to torment in school?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Routine slash-fest is fun for fans of the genre, and contains the usual T&amp;A quota for films if its ilk. The ending is a bit more imaginative than your standard slasher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MPAA: Rated for violence/gore, language, sexuality, nudity, and some drug content.

This was a classic case of something that should never have been. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband had left her because she wouldn&#39;t live in some commune with him (he was mad that Reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society). Right then and there I had problems with the series - come on, I say to myself, is this the same noble Michael Stivic that countered Archie Bunker&#39;s right winged philosophies? The series went on, but it just didn&#39;t have any pizazz. Whatever momentum Sally Struthers gained from All the Family was long gone. Maybe, if the series had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of All In The Family, it might have worked out. Ah well, that&#39;s show business.

I cannot believe that the Indian film industry still puts out such third-rate dross as Waqt. For starters, the storyline is totally implausible  spoilt son gets thrown out of family home so as to teach him some self-sufficiency. So what does he do? He promptly goes on to win some national talent contest by doing some star jumps in front of a panel of judges (I honestly am not joking here). In the meantime, his dad is dying of lung cancer, but keeps it a secret from the son, but he survives long enough to see his son become famous, to see his new grandson and also make a new toy giraffe with his own hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is cringe worthy in its hamminess  no effort was made to try and act in any convincing manner by any of the main players in this film. As usual for Indian films, the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the concerns of the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, the main losers when such dire films are made are the intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a film. The actors, such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, will still be revered as Gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in Bollywood.

I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom. They basically stimulate themselves to their own chat, she then insists on meeting the participant in person. She meets him, has sex, ties him up and then murders him in cold blood. The plot then deteriorates further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff. Do not bother renting it much less purchasing it, even if it is in the $1 DVD bin. I plan to take my copy of the DVD to Goodwill. I am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating.

Anthony Quinn is a master at capturing our heart and sympathy. He portrays a Romanian peasant with a below average IQ, harassed by his wife to do more. It&#39;s WWII and the Nazis have taken over his country. Soon he finds himself digging entrenchments hoping to benefit himself in his wife&#39;s eyes. The Nazis have different ideas. Through the next years we watch events unfold through his naive eyes, but all he wants to do is go home. His manipulations and ill luck just get him in further hot water. Finally, through no fault of his own, we see his picture on the cover of &#34;Der Spiegel&#34; as the perfect Aryan. The war ends and the allies put him on trial for war crimes. But all our peasant wants to do is return home to his wife.

Having previously seen this short on VHS tape with the feature Summer Stock, I just rewatched Every Sunday on the TCM site. It marked the film debut of 15-year-old Deanna Durbin and of 14-year-old Judy Garland outside of her two older sisters. These two teens showcase their musical talents with a solo from Deanna of &#34;Il Bacio&#34;, then one from Judy of &#34;Waltz with a Swing&#34; before the two climax with &#34;Americana&#34;. The slight plot of this 11-minute film concerns the possible unemployment of Edna&#39;s (Durbin&#39;s real first name which is the way she&#39;s addressed here) grandfather&#39;s conducting job at the park because of low attendance. With the two girls&#39; help, you can probably guess what happens from there! Contrasts are marked not only with Garland&#39;s and Durbin&#39;s musical choice but also with their height, poise, and movement. Despite all that, they perform quite well at the end and it&#39;s almost surprising that M-G-M chose Garland while Durbin was already contracted at Universal as this short was made but was briefly allowed back in since her feature debut (Three Smart Girls) was in the early preparing stages. Judy herself would make her first feature (Pigskin Parade) at 20th Century-Fox as M-G-M was deciding what movie she would next star in. That would be Broadway Melody of 1938 where she would perform the show stopping number, &#34;Dear Mr. Gable (You Made Me Love You)&#34;. But back to this short, Every Sunday provides a warm and wonderful glimpse of two star singers at the beginning of their legendary careers unaware of what the future holds for them...

An annoying experience. Improvised dialogue, handheld cameras for no effect, directionless plot, contrived romance, ick! to the whole mess. Ron Silver was the only real actor. Gretta Sacchi was TERRIBLE! Henry Jaglom did better with Eating which suited his style much more.

&#34;Foxes&#34; is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s. And unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it (Porky&#39;s, Fast Times at Ridgement High), the movie holds up well against time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi Scott Baio (remember him?) lead a fine young cast that&#39;s well worth watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film follows four Southern California girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents. The teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties, concerts, or out on the street. Seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill, party, or boy away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But rather than condemning them, the film is sympathetic, blaming absent, uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone. And the charismatic cast is impossible to dislike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film&#39;s opening  a long and loving pan - sets the tone for what follows. We see the girls asleep at daybreak amid the objects that define teen girlhood, from Twinkies to a picture of a young John Travola, while Donna Summer&#39;s &#34;On the Radio&#34; is scored beneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life. Annie (Runaway rocker Cherie Currie) is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill. Deirdre (Kandice Stroh) is the boy crazy drama queen. Madge (Marlilyn Stroh) is the shy girl in over her head. And Foster is the one with the plan. It&#39;s her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line (Sally Kellerman).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s an almost impossible job and one that Foster ultimately fails at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite its age, &#34;Foxes&#34; remains a pleasure to watch. Dated hair, clothes, and references to Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill haven&#39;t hurt the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography is simply stunning, with breathtaking filtered shots of the L.A. basin at dawn, dusk and at night. Giorgio Moroder adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of Donna Summer and Janis Ian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the movie&#39;s biggest disappointment is that the young stars around Foster never broke out like the casts of &#34;St. Elmo&#39;s Fire&#34; (1985) or &#34;Empire Records&#34; (1995). &#34;Foxes&#34; shows why they should have. But perhaps like Bowling for Soup&#39;s song &#34;1985,&#34; they just hit a wall.

Who wrote this? Some guy named John Cohen. I guess this was the first screenplay he&#39;s ever worked on. Someone should&#39;ve told him you&#39;re supposed to write dialog that sounds like something someone actually might say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And who directed this? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My the nut has fallen far from the tree. Someone might have wanted to let him know that you can, in fact, shoot a scene in a cab in New York, and it will look real, and you won&#39;t have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. Might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully he&#39;s learned that lesson now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Jessica Simpson... naturally she can&#39;t act. Hell, she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn, and yet she&#39;s starring in this movie. OH wait, it was produced by her father. Okay, that&#39;s why she got the part. That&#39;s really the only reason I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So should I be surprised it&#39;s bad? No. Should I be amazed at how bad it is? I think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as I did. I mean you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this... it&#39;s not just bad, it&#39;s the complete opposite of a classic film. Think of a great Woody Allen movie, this film is as bad as that film is good. It&#39;s the Anti-Annie Hall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I didn&#39;t pay to see it, I stopped watching ten minutes in cus I couldn&#39;t go on. No doubt I would&#39;ve walked out of the theater sooner. In fact I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing. The film starts out laughably bad, and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then, around when the first act is ending, you realize it&#39;ll only get worse, and that&#39;s when you either need to leave, or kill yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water boarding at Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer the water boarding.

Tierney&#39;s an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times Tierney&#39;s incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old cliché about it &#34;only happening in the movies&#34; applies here in spades. Then there&#39;s the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets don&#39;t help either, and neither does director Feist&#39;s obvious lack of feel for the material. Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat. In fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. Too bad that Tieney&#39;s career never really gelled. I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another. His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best. Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it&#39;s a disappointment.

Is it a coincidence that Orca was made two years after Jaws? Orca isn&#39;t exactly a &#34;Jaws rip off&#34; but it is obvious that it tried to profit from Jaws&#39;s success. First of all Orca in my opinion was a bad movie, not terrible but definitely not good, average at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is basically a male killer whale (orca) after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge. I couldn&#39;t stand to watch this movie again. The direction of this film is poor and when compared to Jaws it looks like the director, producers, and writers were almost talentless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the acting, it was very average and believable, however the actual characters aren&#39;t the least bit likable. The effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The violence is confusing, bloody, and not recommended for more sensitive people. The music is overdone and very loud, drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times. I hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale (killer whales don&#39;t mate with only one mate as depicted in Orca).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this movie was bad/poor in my opinion, because of the reasons listed above. Some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so I&#39;m not going to bash this movie and I can understand why some people may like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Rating: 3.5/10 (but for its concept possibly a 5/10)

Utterly predictable silly show about a man who has killed his wife by mowing her down when driving and claimed he had blacked out. Why was he still driving a car? Why did he still feel able to drive a car having killed his wife with one? This question has not occurred to the writers. The story then witters on about a psychologist and her failing marriage which is tied into the failing marriage of wife-killing blackout driver. An omniscient mother and one dimensional child are thrown in for good measure, and the whole builds up to a predictable denouement and crashing finale. Are police psychologists so easily taken in? Deadful writing that the actors do their best with, but they are doomed to failure. This is on a par with a Harlequin Romance. Don&#39;t waste your time watching this one unless that&#39;s what you are aiming for.

I just came from seeing this movie and decided to see what others thought of it. I&#39;m left wondering if these people who give glowing reviews saw the same film! This is potentially a very good story, but it fails to hit the mark. The script is very weak - the plot has so many holes that it would make a great dip net for the fishing scenes. The characters were not well developed and the storyline jumps around so much that I found myself asking the question &#34;How did we get here?&#34; at least a half dozen times during the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a lack of any chemistry between the cast members. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan&#39;s antics during the filming. It was pretty clear that everyone showed up and did their job, but didn&#39;t commit to their roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a movie worth seeing...go for a walk, play a board game, take a nice warm bath and save your money for something that&#39;s worth it!

I really tried to like this movie but in the end it just didn&#39;t work for me. I have seen most of Kitamura&#39;s output and have found it to be very variable. Alive, like all of his films has an interesting plot, some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity. However, these qualities are in painfully short supply in Alive. The plot is cool if not all that original and could have made for a pretty ace film. Unfortunately, the pacing is painfully slow and the film takes an age to get going, before reaching fairly predictable places. The action is just about passable, with the final fight pretty cool, and the earlier one about OK. The earlier one is also marred by overspeedy camera-work, making for less coherency. There are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue but the film still drags badly. The characters are neither well fleshed out nor well acted and the setting and general color scheme is drab and boring. The film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest, perhaps judicious use of the fast forward button could improve it. With about twenty minutes taken off the run time this could be a pretty decent sci fi thriller. But the full length film is dull. Only recommended to very patient and determined Kitumura fans.

This film is absolute cinematic genius. It has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance. The effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie. Jack Long plays the part of abbot white exceptionally well, he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil. If your a kung fu fan or just an action movie enthusiast this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy. For any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin. This film is definitely 10/10 quality and should be considered as one of the greatest eastern movies of all time.

Legend of Zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years. It transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art. With unmatched visual sceneries and story of divine proportions, Legend of Zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its majesty. This movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life. The acting is perfect for this type of movie; if you were an immortal with supernatural powers I would think you&#39;d keep more to yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the comments of many, the plot is actually quite EASY to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency. Anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not be paying attention since or are used to such levels of sophistication as the titanic. The plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air. Legend of Zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur. Allow yourself to be completely engulfed within its fantastical vision and you will grow to love this movie.

I&#39;m a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it&#39;s at for me. Some of the other posts are right: &#34;Wannabes&#34; isn&#39;t going to rival &#34;The Godfather&#34; for best mob film ever. On the other hand, &#34;Wannabes&#34; is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman. He doesn&#39;t stand out at all, rather, delivers a great performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#39;t win many awards, but it is deserving of a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. I found it for 7 bucks at Blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised to say the least! Highly recommended.

Despite having an absolutely horrid script (more about that later), this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. Aside from one or two REAL stinkers, I&#39;d probably watch just about anything with them in the film, as I am a huge fan of Hollywood&#39;s golden age of the 1930s and 40s. However, no matter how much I love their films, I just can&#39;t recommend this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort. The two haven&#39;t yet met, but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which Fonda horribly yodels while skiing. It was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but I stuck it out--especially when Fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the yodeling!! In hindsight, perhaps I should have just turned it off then! Fonda is knocked out in the fall and Barbara goes for help. Back at the ski lodge, he seems okay but fortunately she is ALSO a doctor and has him x-rayed and nurses him back to health. He, in turn, becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her. Despite hardly knowing each other, they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once home, however, all isn&#39;t rosy as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy. The film plays it all for laughs, but frankly Fonda&#39;s behaviors were really creepy--spying on her and her male patients, attacking or threatening ANY man she treats, tripping a patient who already has a back injury and stomping into a surprise party and insisting that everyone there (men and women) are out to steal away his wife. He comes off as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic, but it&#39;s all supposed to be for laughs. Considering that he seems like a dangerous nut, you would think that Stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restraining order! But, oddly, she gets mad but just can&#39;t stay mad at Fonda because he&#39;s so........? I can&#39;t think of the right word--&#39;creepy&#39; is all that comes to mind!!! Later, out of the blue, multi-millionaire Fonda gets a job working the counter at a department store. Then, through magical thinking, he and Babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past--so a job apparently cures anger and suspicions. When this job falls through, the film ends with Fonda buying his own hospital, giving Barbara a job there and they live happily ever after. They don&#39;t go any further with the story, but I assume based on Fonda&#39;s character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first portion at the ski lodge and the next did NOT fit well together, nor did the final &#34;Horatio Alger&#34; inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world. They were like three separate plots but despite this, the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy! What a creepy little film! Thank goodness neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely films.

In trying to keep up with the hipness of youthful audiences as the 70s approached, OaCD,YCSF was the product of odder and odder material selected for musicalization. Here it&#39;s past life regression, ESP and hypno-therapy... pretty loopy! The real problem with the concept (music or not) are the extraordinarily low dramatic stakes; just where can a movie go, and what can happen, when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl he can&#39;t stand? It can&#39;t go any place new, but strangely, it can&#39;t even go any place old! Indeed, if it could, audiences would still have no interest in the union of Yves Montand (playing a much older, arrogant, French ass) and Streisand. (a much younger girl). We never become invested in them, their situations or outcomes. Montand is miscast and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics unintelligible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s all been given a shallow 60s veneer that makes it eminently disposable; despite efforts here and there from Minelli that are respectable. It&#39;s not even adapted from a non-musical story that met with any previous success... that&#39;s just too passe! Streisand occasionally has some funny business to offer, as when she&#39;s trying not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance. But she over-relies on her ingratiating (translation: irritating) kooky, Jewish girl shtick. She can however sing very well, at both the &#34;gentle&#34; and &#34;powerhouse&#34; ends of the range. Amidst a score of musical dross, she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs* of much higher caliber than anything Fanny or Dolly had to offer. &#39;He isn&#39;t you&#39; is a sweet trifle as sublime as Lorenz Hart&#39;s &#39;My Funny Valentine,&#39; but the movie isn&#39;t able to realize any impact from it; because the lyrics don&#39;t seem to be referring to anything in the movie, and nothing remotely suggests a great love is blossoming between Chabot and Melinda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cut we can view is a poor hatchet job of a much bigger film. Strong research shows a longer, better-explained and more decorative, but not necessarily a better film at: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. You can be sure there&#39;s be more Babs in that version but more importantly, there&#39;d be more thoughtful work from Minelli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end Montand sends Babs off to sing the title song, after she discovers he&#39;s a total dick who feeds her a self-esteem homily to allow himself off the hook. And she takes the bait. So, uh... hooray for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*Hurry it&#39;s lovely up here, Love with all the trimmings, He isn&#39;t you, &amp; the title song)

This movie is not as horrible as most Sci-Fi Channel movies. I am used to seeing the gray CGI blobs and the amateurish special effects such as close-ups of fake blood that make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation. However, I had thought that I had seen all the possible lows that the Sci-Fi Channel could hit. Then I saw this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup? Those are the main Alien Vampires in this movie. You can clearly see the fingers inside the rubbery sock puppets. A talking hand comes out of the guts of victims, and the Vampire who is on the Vampire Hunter&#39;s team can talk to these Rubber Sock puppets in Transylvanian. How did Alien Vampires learn Transylvanian? And isn&#39;t Transylvania in Romania? So shouldn&#39;t they be talking Romanian? Why would some little town have their own language? If you can suspend your gag reflex and get past the talking rubber socks with the fingers clearly moving inside the Aliens&#39; heads; then you have to deal with the other alien vampires. There are the &#34;Leatherfaces&#34; who like to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are the just plain ugly ones that all seem to have a lot of facial scars. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so that they can sabotage the Defense Systems so that these Space Vampires can attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you think all of the above is funny and worth a laugh, you have to deal with the third rate cast of Network TV rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes which are constantly fighting among themselves. Why does almost every Sci-Fi Channel movie have to use lead characters that are annoying, abrasive, crude, or just totally unsympathetic? I found myself hoping the talking rubber socks would win.

I&#39;m feeling a little protective of this film because it was my introduction to the U.N.C.L.E.-verse. The year was 1972, and I.T.V. ran all eight features in one bumper run ( followed by re-runs of &#39;The Persuaders&#39; starring Tony Curtis and Roger Moore ) on Saturday evenings. &#39;The Karate Killers&#39; was chosen to open the season. It commenced with a cool action sequence as Solo and Kuryakin&#39;s sports car got attacked by a squadron of THRUSH mini-copters. I was a fan for life from that moment on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the main credits ( nice to see a special title sequence here instead of the usual practice of slowing down action footage ) we go to the laboratory of Dr.Simon True ( Jim Boles ), inventor of a new formula to extract gold from seawater. True&#39;s wife Amanda ( Joan Crawford ) has been having an affair with THRUSH agent Randolph ( Herbert Lom ). A ruthless fellow indeed, he kills both the doctor and his wife, before hunting for the formula. True has prepared for the event - he has divided it into five segments, each written on a photograph of himself, and sent it to his five daughters, all of whom are scattered throughout the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solo and Kuryakin set out to get the formula first, leading to a string of episodes in different locations, and cameos from the likes of Telly Savalas ( as a tight-fisted Italian Count ), Terry-Thomas, and Curt Jurgens. One of Dr.True&#39;s daughters - Sandy ( Kim Darby ) - accompanies the U.N.C.L.E. boys on their global quest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having assembled the formula, THRUSH turns up and makes them hand it over, before whisking them off to their secret base at the North Pole...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the U.N.C.L.E. feature films, this is the one I feel should have been produced specially for the cinema. It hurts by being a television product, albeit even one more slightly expensive than usual. No location filming was done, and the various segments come across as repetitive, usually culminating in a scrap between U.N.C.L.E. and THRUSH. Of the cast, Joan Crawford is memorably hammy in her small role, and Curt Jurgens badly miscast as a sugar daddy. As a London bobby, Terry-Thomas is as delightful as ever, and Herbert Lom good as the chief villain. Kim Darby grates though as &#39;Sandy&#39;. She should have been told to stay at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is surprising about this is that it manages to be more amusing and entertaining than many official cinema releases of the time, including &#39;In Like Flint&#39;, &#39;Casino Royale&#39; and &#39;The Ambushers&#39;. I&#39;d love to know how Solo and company escaped from THRUSH H.Q. after Randolph&#39;s death though.

Let&#39;s get one thing straight, this gets an 7 out of 10 not on a normal scale, but out of the bad movie scale. this is the kind of movie you rent on purpose, where you intentionally walk in knowing that it is a horrendous knockoff and shun&#39;d by everyone else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went in with one promise from the movie, that there will be snakes on a train, and it Delivers! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gore itself is really good, and the characters have awesome roles. Come on, it has everything from stoned train pilots to teenage girls trafficking drugs, even a Electrical Engineer getting his pimp on! You get to see some topless nudity, explosions, snakes, gore, and a Mexican main lead running around curing his girlfriend by hitting his crack pipe and blowing the smoke in her face!! As I mentioned and many others have, the movie pacing is a bit off, but respectable nonetheless. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movies like this keep our group tradition of banding together and all chipping in a buck or two to watch masterpieces such as this. There can be no better time spent then coming together to enjoy a good bad movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could learn a thing or two from the likes of other such fine flicks as Alien Lock-down or Boa vs Python, but those are some big shoes to fill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A solid 7 out of 10.

This is by far the most vapid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air, and this is coming from someone who remembers &#34;San Pedro Beach Bums&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a &#34;walk&#34;. The end result was straight out of Monty Python&#39;s &#34;Ministry of Silly Walks&#34; sketch. I couldn&#39;t laugh hard enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there&#39;s the ubiquitous Ms. Banks (as in laughing all the way to the...). She has to be the most annoying self-important woman on TV since Rosie O&#39;Donnell left &#34;The View&#34;. As if modeling was doing great things for mankind. Please. I&#39;ve never found her attractive, and I don&#39;t find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.

The movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too. It was extremely funny. Angelena Jolie was wonderful as Juliet. The parents are hilarious.They are caterers as well as enemies.The kids play the parts of Romeo and Juliet in the church play.They fall in love and their parents try to keep them apart.(Spoiler Ahead. I think) They sneak off after a party and do it. Surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie. If you don&#39;t like stereotypes and the defilement of classic literature don&#39;t watch. If you don&#39;t mind those you will have a blast watching this one.

I just realized why the colors and sets in &#34;Sakuran&#34; were so flashy and gaudy, and just painful to look at. The story is about a high-class prostitute known as an oiran in Japanese. Their kimono were always flashier and gaudier than other kimono so that the oiran would stand out. But the director, Mika Ninagawa, had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character, or even the story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me the creeps. You couldn&#39;t call it acting. It was nothing more than catering to her flipped-out, high-school-girl fan base. Hey Anna, good luck on that one as you get older. Yeah, right, an oiran as a crude and vulgar, prone- to-violence, biker chick. Didn&#39;t we already see you portray this character in a more appropriate movie?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story was painfully boring and predictable. What is the story of &#34;Sakuran&#34;? An obnoxious little bitch ever remains true to her self which is just that: an obnoxious bitch. She finds that, inexplicably, men are attracted to her and that she has an unexplained ability to manipulate men and becomes a successful, high-class prostitute even though she talks and behaves like she&#39;s a member of a female biker gang. This so-called seductive ability of hers is talked about but we never see it in action, probably due to the ineptitude of the main, pretend-phony-biker chick, I mean &#34;actress.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main character of the movie makes a wealthy and powerful man angry at her because she keeps him waiting while she services a much more lowly customer. Not very oiran-like, is it? How could such a woman ever become an oiran? Oh, because the previous oiran got herself killed and the house needed a whore that could demand a high price. Who would pay a high price for a slut so cheap? Rumors get around. How could there be no repercussions for what she did to the powerful guy? Because the screenwriters are dolts. They just made up a bunch of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then an even more wealthy and powerful guy falls for her (why?) and she throws him over for a penniless guy who is generally cold and distant toward her but respects who she really is (which doesn&#39;t make sense. How can anyone respect someone so worthless?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of crap, it&#39;s like the director squatted down and took a huge, psychedelic-colored dump on the aesthetics, culture, and society of the Edo Period. What of such things as sabi, mono no aware, wabi, subtlety, elegance, a rigidly hierarchical society? All shat upon by a director who comes off as a senseless, nouveau-riche parvenu. The amazing thing is that so many other Japanese, in watching this movie, squatted down around the director and took steaming spoonfuls of this blazing-colored stinking crap and exclaimed how tasty it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argentinean tango music with violin and bandoneon as backdrop for the Edo Period when Japan was totally isolated from the international world (except for the 3.7 acres of Dejima)? Why not just have Anna, the bad-ass-biker oiran, answer her cell phone and the rich and powerful daimyo character drive off in a hissy fit in his red Ferrari? The music we had to listen to was jarring and anachronistic (the same as the art design). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Near the ending, I liked that there were only two or three tiny flowers on the shrine cherry tree. But, earlier, the second she said she would leave the quarters when it bloomed, we all knew exactly what would happen. How boring, to telegraph the ending so clearly. But what&#39;s the point of the old tree blooming? That rich and powerful guy already made the pleasure quarters bloom in cherry blossoms like the mountains of Yoshino in spring. That didn&#39;t impress her at all? No, of course not. I already know that about whores. The guys that treat them nicely get kicked in the balls. Maybe it bugs the whores to have people idealize them when they themselves know the truth of who they are: just cheap and worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the director&#39;s obsession with goldfish, the second to last scene should have been of a goldfish bowl on a verandah accidentally knocked over. Two fish tumble into a stream which carries them off to escape beyond the walls of the pleasure quarters, belying how goldfish are stuck in their bowl and can&#39;t survive outside (just like the denizen&#39;s relationship with the pleasure quarters). Otherwise the talk of the fate of goldfish has no meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the final scene the cherry trees were full in bloom, but the brevity of the blooms is one thing special about cherry blossoms. I couldn&#39;t help thinking that soon enough dusk would wipe away all the soft pink color and warmth from the scene. The sky would go quickly from hints of shadow, into an ever- deepening gloom, and night would fall. It would become cold, very cold. And dark. That really wasn&#39;t a happy ending, was it? Romantic love (in the Edo Period?) could survive in the face of terrible poverty and being ostracized for about as long as those cherry trees bloomed. Maybe a few days, unless it rained sooner. But the unconsummated romantic love we see here? It&#39;s existence in this period is incomprehensible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Tsuchiya walking in the shoes of an oiran? She couldn&#39;t do it. Literally. Check out the scene of her &#34;promenade&#34; where she seems to have the correct footwear on but she has to hold on to some guy&#39;s shoulder to keep from tumbling on her ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to give this movie two stars for the art direction but then I realized what that was all about: sick dominance on the part of the director. Those colors and sets are just the way the director has of screaming, &#34;I&#39;m the most important one here! Me! It&#39;s all about me!!!!&#34;

I don&#39;t see much reason to get into this movie in much detail. Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo, author and survivor of &#34;A Season in Hell&#34;, recruited from prison by his only friend, Major Richard Crenna, to secretly return to Vietnam, take photos of the American prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps, and return without engaging the enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fat chance. What if he actually DID nothing more than sneak in, take pics, and sneak out? Who would come to see the movie? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s essentially a celebration of Stallone&#39;s muscles. Preparing for his mission, we see his well-oiled muscles bulging. (They are oiled and bulging throughout.) There is the ritual strapping on of black leather, ugly guns, and even uglier knives. The black guns are cleaned, assembled with loud clacks, and almost as oiled as Stallone&#39;s muscles. The bow is tested and, yes, it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemy&#39;s forehead. The knife is sharpened with slick snicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stallone and one of his POWs are betrayed by one or two of the suits from Washington, cynical politicians who, you can bet, were never even in a fist fight in grammar school. No guts, you know? Just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie does what it set out to do, but what it set out to do is meretricious. It deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid-1980s that there were uncountable numbers of MIAs quietly kept in wretched camps by the North Vietnamese. The bumper stickers were ubiquitous. (Free Our MIAs.) Why would they keep them? It was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the POWs into a slave labor force -- in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor. Or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the United States -- a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a captive, Rambo is treated in a Medieval fashion by the North Vietnamese. Dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists, his muscles still on display. Then, not content with subhuman Vietnamese, a Russian officer is brought in to play the part of the Gestapo officer -- &#34;Vee haff vays of MAKING you remember.&#34; A high-tech type, the Russian uses psychology and electricity, not just pig dump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until &#34;this country loves us as much as we love it,&#34; bringing up another myth that Vets returning from Vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed, which is why I guess we elected so many to the Congress and appointed others to high-echelon positions. The last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group. At least Rambo&#39;s aimless drifting left room open for a sequel, which arrived apace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but Rambo is humorless. It marches dully through it&#39;s phantasmal ideological swamp, killing without mercy, barely speaking, barely able to speak. To speak is a sign of weakness.

My college professor says that Othello may be Shakespeare&#39;s finest drama. I don&#39;t know if I agree with him yet. I bought this video version of the film. First I love Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. SUrprisingly, he didn&#39;t direct it but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare just as well as British actors can do. not that there was a British vs. American issue about it. In fact, if we all work together then Shakespeare can reach the masses which it richly deserves to do. Apart from other Shakespeare tragedies, this is dealt with the issue of race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and shown the complicatedness of their union together. While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, he is weak for jealousy and fears losing her to a non-Moorish man like Cassio. It&#39;s quite a great scene at the end of the film but I won&#39;t reveal the ending. IT&#39;s just worth watching. I think they edited much of the lines to 2 hours but they always edit Shakespeare.

The film begins with promise, but lingers too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation. We are left hanging, but with nothing much else save languid shots of grave and pensive male faces to savour. Certainly no rope up the wall to help us climb over. It&#39;s a shame, because the concept is not without merit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are left wondering why a loving couple - a father and son no less - should be so estranged from the real world that their own world is preferable when claustrophobic beyond all imagining. This loss of presence in the real world is, rather too obviously and unnecessarily, contrasted with the son having enlisted in the armed forces. Why not the circus, so we can at least appreciate some colour? We are left with a gnawing sense of loss, but sadly no enlightenment, which is bewildering given the film is apparently about some form of attainment not available to us all.

Get Shorty was an excellent film. It was funny and had the perfect balance of highly comical acting and a serious plot. Be Cool is like some cheap knock-off trying to pass for a sequel. John Travolta as Chili Palmer seems to have forgotten that he was ever in the mob. He plays it like he&#39;s a bored movie exec, rather than a bored movie exec who used to be a Shylock. Uma Thurman, great in nearly every role she&#39;s ever played, comes off as strained and confusing. Is she supposed to be ditzy or clever? The chemistry between her and Travolta is strained and uncomfortable. Other than that, just add every movie cliché you can think of. A well-educated rap producer by Cedric the Entertainer, an inept gangster wannabe in Andre 3000, the girl with heart, soul, and a good set of pipes in Christina Milian, a gimmicky black dude wannabe in Vince Vaughn, and a stupid celebrity cameo by Stephen Tyler. The only funny part was the Rock, who invents his own new cliché as a gay Samoan bodyguard actor wannabe. Probably the biggest crime is the plot: IT MAKES NO SENSE. Get Shorty was clever with Chili playing one group against another and coming out on top. But this film tries that with about a million different characters. And even Chili doesn&#39;t seem to know what&#39;s going on. Fans of Get Shorty be warned: this is a very different, very worse movie.

Well, when before I saw this film I really wasn&#39;t sure whether it would be my cup of tea...how wrong I was! I thought that this was one of the best films I&#39;ve watched for a very long time, a real family classic. The story of a young evacuee and his new &#39;foster&#39; dad, this film ticks all the boxes. I&#39;ve not read the book (maybe that&#39;s a good thing &amp; meant I enjoyed the film more) but with regards to the story, I really can&#39;t think of any bad points, hence scoring it 10 out of 10 (and I hardly ever think anything warrants top marks!). By the time William proclaimed &#39;I CAN RIDE MY BIKE, DAD!&#39; I was sobbing my heart out (anyone who&#39;s seen it will understand, I&#39;m sure). Really heartwarming, and definitely recommended.

Very heart warming and uplifting movie. Outstanding performance by Alisan Porter (Curly Sue). I saw this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it immensely. I just caught it again on the Mplex channel, and Curly Sue touched my heart again.

Utterly pretentious nonsense. The material is dull, dull, dull, and most of the cast wouldn&#39;t even have made understudies in Allen&#39;s earlier films. And to have to listen to the unfunny Will Ferrell do his Woody Allen imitation makes me loathe the second-rate (though mysteriously popular) Ferrell even more. It appears that the morose 70-year old Allen should have knocked off work when the clock rang in a new century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly tried to get involved in the film, but it was just impossible; my snyapses couldn&#39;t fire that slowly. So, rather than doze off and kill the afternoon sleeping in an upright position I got up, left my wife and daughter in the theater, and went out to the car where I had a really good book to re-read (George Bailey&#39;s great tome of 30 years ago, &#34;Germans.&#34;) The day turned out pretty well after all, no thanks to Woody.

Jack Frost 2 was a horrible, terrible, sadly pathetic excuse for a sequal to a great movie. The original, was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste. And the snowman went around murdering people, and avoiding blow dryers like the plague. This, however, was a far cry from the quality of the original. It seems like this even had a lower-budget because for some reason, after an hour into this film, I still hadn&#39;t seen the snowman. Some revenge he&#39;s getting if he&#39;s always in the form of Ice cubes with a cheesy voice-over and a little shake of the cooler he rests in to give animation to the character. Disappointing to no belief, even for a fan of bad cinema.

I saw this film in Wales in July. It deals with the courage of Czech pilots who flew numerous missions for the RAF after their country had been occupied by the Nazis. In this film, the action takes place both in the early 1950&#39;s when these pilots are being beaten in political prisons in Czeckoslavakia and during World War II in Britain. They were imprisoned after their return to their homeland because the Communist regime viewed these warriors as a threat to their occupation of Czeckoslavakia. The pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against Nazi pilots. This film contain a love sub-plot that does make sense because it helps us to understand that both civilians and soldiers made great sacrifices to preserve democracy. The end of this film indicates that the heroism of these Czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990&#39;s after the restoration of democracy in the country then known as Czeckoslavakia. This powerful and moving film was made with financial support from the Czech government. I highly recommend this film.

What&#39;s not to like about this movie? Every year you know that you&#39;re going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well. A very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the good of having money like that if you can&#39;t do fun things with it. It was a win-win situation. A regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas like he imagined. Only if.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. It was a fun and funny movie.

This western is done in a different manner than most others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on his ranch. How this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of Americana. I would have preferred to see this on the big screen rather than on tape, but it&#39;s worth a look to see just how life was back in the real west. Cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Torn &amp; Farrell excel in this movie.

The Captain and Tennille have released a very good 3 DVD package with minimal editing. Unlike most variety show releases these shows have not been hacked to bits. The musical and dance numbers are included with the skits just as they were when first broadcast. I suspect that some musical numbers on the DVD may have been edited into shows in which they did not originally appear but have been unable to verify that suspicion. I&#39;ve noticed a few inconsistencies between what is on the DVD and program information I&#39;ve found on the net. I&#39;ve been unable to verify whether the net information is inaccurate or if the musical performances have been edited into the shows on the DVD. Whatever the truth may be, I&#39;m very appreciative of the efforts made by the production company. I wish every variety show released would show the same respect for the format. I would guess about half the shows broadcast are included. I believe they ran into rights problems on the shows which weren&#39;t included. Hopefully those issues can be resolved and a Volume 2 can be released sometime in the future. There are some individual music videos along with a dance rehearsal among the extras. I recommend this DVD to any C&amp;T fan.

H.G. Wells&#39; War of the Worlds by director David Michael Latt is a slightly less-than-average flick which isn&#39;t too bad if one considers the budget he had to work with - only $1 million. For this budget, the production value wasn&#39;t too bad - the best part of it is the visual effects (I was thoroughly impressed with the CGI considering the budget) and sound design. The less-then-stellar parts of this film are the story which is VERY prolonged at best (but again I think this is because of the budget they had - they had to prolong certain scenes to create the feature length 97 minutes), the acting (again it&#39;s because the actors had no story to work with), very few exceptional camera shots, and the music. However, again, I can let the negative parts go for the most part only because this film was made for a meager budget and still had good production value. Still you should,d see it for the sake of seeing how a low budget version of War of the Worlds CAN be made even with flaws. 4 out of 10.

This is crap....utter crap. I cannot believe any company could even get people to work on a film like this. Full Moon has a number of awful films, but this has got to be the worst. First off, the plot doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s odd. It&#39;s like, they took an idea for the story, and kind of never really got around to developing it. They seemed to have just wasted a lot of time filming outside shots while the two &#34;heroes&#34; drove around in the desert, and Bradbury talks nonsense for about 10 minutes. There were two scenes in the movie (when Dez and Dazzy are driving, and when Dez and Bradbury are driving) where it just went on and on and on...it was almost like 2 music videos in the place where there should have been some dialog or action. They just drove for about 5 minutes, with nothing but music and shots of the surrounding landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, we come to the acting, which is simply horrible. First off, the girl who plays Dazzy is just a beast. She is so scary looking, I wanted to look away when she was on screen! Horrible casting. Then, you have the guy who played Dez, who couldn&#39;t act if his life depended on it. His &#34;crying&#34; is actually funny, and his madman antics are even funnier. The guy who plays the desk clerk at the hotel is just as bad, as is the guy who plays Bradbury. There was no acting that deserves any recognition in this movie whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup effects...hmmm, can anyone say pathetic? The &#34;effects&#34; were so fake, they were laughable. The crazy little robot looking catepillar thing grabs onto someone, they cut away, and when they come back, the guy has a completely fake looking flesh wound. Nice. Did they run out of money on the makeup budget or what?! I must say the druggie chick who is in the one girl&#39;s apartment...nice makeup there too. I think they were going for a drugged look, and I think she was supposed to have a black guy, but it looked more like cheap zombie makeup for halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is just horrible from the start. The story is stupid and very, very unoriginal, the direction looks as tho it was performed by a 10 year old, the acting is the lowest of the low, and so on. STAY AWAY from this movie at all costs. It&#39;s only 70 minutes long in the first place, and atleast 20 minutes of that is taken up by either music and no dialog or the character sitting around in the hotel. Do not waste your time on this piece of garbage.

So this is what actress Kim Basinger has succumbed to? Mmm to tell the truth the film&#39;s title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic, but simplicity can have its strengths. Anyhow by the end of &#39;While She Was Out&#39; I was left feeling rather indifferent. Not the worse (despite being engulfed by negatives), but there&#39;s easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm, but compact and unbalanced late-night survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid, when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material (taken from a short story), along with the very variable performances. The flimsy script was poorly thought-out (which isn&#39;t so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off), so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events. As for the bunch of stereotypical goons (led by an unconvincing Lukas Hass as a loose canon) terrorizing Basinger, well they were less than threatening, but hopelessly clueless. Watching Basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand (don&#39;t ask me why?) knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didn&#39;t elicit tension or emotion but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up. Basinger&#39;s performance is stout-like, but doesn&#39;t craft much empathy. Craig Sheffer shows up as her hot-headed husband. Strangely I couldn&#39;t keep my eyes off the screen thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic (why would she be constantly carrying it) and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug her choices were quite disappointing. Watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty, due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Montford&#39;s soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy, as it pretty much chugs along. I liked the opening credits though, with its hauntingly sullen score (which is the most effective thing throughout the feature) and polished photography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No great shakes. Doesn&#39;t ask much of your time, but I wouldn&#39;t care to see it again. However with the inclusion of a Joy Division song, it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen.

&#34;Unhinged&#34; is one strange little film, a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre. It&#39;s hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique. It&#39;s plot is fairly overdone--three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter. Very quickly, the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic. On top of that, the mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner. The old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them. Halfway through the film, when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help, the killing begins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the acting goes, this film is at the bottom of the barrel. NONE of the three stranded girls can act, particularly the &#34;lead&#34; girl. It is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same, wooden tone throughout the film. The mother and daughter are better, but not much. The film is also quite dull in parts and really, really drags. The killings are gruesome, but nothing we haven&#39;t seen before. However, as mentioned on here, the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending. It comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic &#34;Sleepaway Camp.&#34; Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring, boring pacing. The isolated, creepy looking mansion and the dark, foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism, but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act. It may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end, but I say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes. 4 out 10

Preminger&#39;s adaptation of G. B. Shaw&#39;s &#39;&#39;Saint Joan&#39;&#39;(screenplay by Graham Greene) received one of the worst critical reactions in it&#39;s day. It was vilified by the pseudo-elite, the purists and the audiences was unresponsive to a film that lacked the piety and glamour expected of a historical pageant. As in &#39;&#39;Peeping Tom&#39;&#39;, the reaction was malicious and unjustified. Preminger&#39;s adaptation of Shaw&#39;s intellectual exploration of the effects and actions surrounding Joan of Arc(her actual name in her own language is Jeanne d&#39;Arc but this film is in English) is totally faithful to the spirit of the original play, not only on the literal emotional level but formally too. His film is a Brechtian examination of the functioning of institutions, the division within and without of various factions all wanting to seize power. As such we are not allowed to identify on an emotional level with any of the characters, including Joan herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As played by Jean Seberg(whose subsequent life offers a eerie parallel to her role here), she is presented as an innocent, a figure of purity whose very actions and presence reveals the corruption and emptiness in everyone. As such Seberg plays her as both Saint and Madwoman. Her own lack of experience as an actress when she made this film(which does show up in spots) conveys the freshness and youth of Jeanne revealing both the fact that Jeanne la Pucelle is a humble illiterate peasant girl who strode out to protect her village and her natural intelligence. By no means did she deserve the harsh criticism that she got on the film&#39;s first release, it&#39;s a performance far beyond the ken and call of any first-time actress with no prior acting experience. Shaw and Preminger took a secular view towards Joan seeing her as a medieval era feminist, not content with being a rustic daughter who&#39;s fate is to be married away or a whore picked up by soldiers to and away from battlefields. Her faith, her voices, her visions which she intermingles with words such as &#34;imagination&#34; and &#34;common sense&#34; leads her to wear the armour of her fellow soldiers to lead them to battle to chase the invading Englishman out of France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet it can be said that the film is more interested in the court of the Dauphin(Richard Widmark), the office of the clergy who try Joan led by Pierre Cauchon(Anton Walbrook, impeccably cast) and the actions of the Earl of Warwick(John Gielgud) then in Joan herself. The superb ensemble cast(all male) portray figures of scheming, Machievellian(although the story precedes Niccolo) opportunists who treat religion as a childish toy to be used and manipulated for their own ends. The sharp sardonic dialogue gives the actors great fun to let loose. John Gielgud as the eminently rational Earl whose intelligence,(albeit accompanied by corruption), allows him to calculate the precise manner in which he can ensure Joan gets burnt at the stake and Anton Walbrook&#39;s Pierre Cauchon brings a three dimensional portrait to this intelligent theologian who will give Joan the fair trial that will certainly find her guilty. Richard Widmark as the Dauphin is a real revelation. As against-type a casting choice you&#39;ll ever find, Widmark portrays the weak future ruler of France in a frenzied, comic caricature that&#39;s as close as this film comes to comic relief. A comic performance that feels like an imitation of Jerry Lewis far more than an impetuous future ruler of France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preminger shot &#39;&#39;Saint Joan&#39;&#39; in black and white, the cinematographer is Georges Perinal who worked with Rene Clair and who did &#39;&#39;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&#39;&#39; in colour. It&#39;s perfectly restrained to emphasize the rational intellectual atmosphere for this film. Preminger&#39;s preference for tracking shots of long uninterrupted takes is key to the effectiveness of the film, there&#39;s no sense of a wasted movement anywhere in his mise-en-scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also marks the direction of Preminger&#39;s most mature(and most neglected period) his focus is on the conflict between individuals and the institutions in which they work, how the institution function and how the individual acts as per his principles. These themes get their most direct treatment in his film and as always he keeps things unpredictable and finds no black and white answers. This is one of his very best and most effective films.

Imagine the worst skits from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90 minute movie. Now, imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity. Now imagine something 50 times worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, now go see The Underground Comedy Movie. That vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever. UCM is the single worst movie I&#39;ve ever seen. There were a few cheap laughs...very few. But it was lame. Even if the intent of the movie was to be lame, it was too lame to be funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#39;m not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else I know bought it. He wasted his money. Vince Offer hasn&#39;t written or directed anything else and it&#39;s no surprise why.

THE NIGHT LISTENER (2006) **1/2 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Dir: Patrick Stettner) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hitchcockian suspenser gives Williams a stand-out low-key performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is it about celebrities and fans? What is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the latest derange fan scenario, based on true events no less, Williams stars as a talk-radio personality named Gabriel No one, who reads stories he&#39;s penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named Pete Logand (Culkin) who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to No one&#39;s editor Ashe (Morton) who gives it to No one to read for himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of Pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named Donna (Collette giving an excellent performance) who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with No one reveals that Pete is dying from AIDS. Naturally No one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover Jess (Cannavale) whose sudden departure from their New York City apartment has No one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into Donna and Pete&#39;s backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn&#39;t anticipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover Terry Anderson and the film&#39;s novice director Stettner) and based on a true story about a fan&#39;s hoax found out has some Hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does. It helps that Williams gives a stand-out, low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him (the one thing that has escaped his own reality) and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy Collette whose one physical trait I will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by Stettner, it pays to listen to your own inner voice: be careful of what you hope for.

I believe I received this film when I was a young buck. I remembered watching it as a child, but i could never find the film. I remembered good ol Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, the Greedy, King Koo Koo. I searched high and low for this movie and still no luck. But one day when I was moving out of my childhood home I had found it. We were reunited. I am 17 years old now. I still watch it. All the time actually. It&#39;s one of the funniest and touching movies I have ever seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally I think they should make a sequel. Mmm, yes a sequel indeed. Now i am even considering getting the captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body!

It&#39;s beyond my comprehension that so much rubbish from Norway has been remastered for DVD release, and still gems like this don&#39;t get a shot at recapturing their past glory. I give this a 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few SciFi films made for Norwegian television. This film is nothing less than a film-historic gem that in so many ways foreshadows the first Alien film. And, my word, Blindpassasjer was first! Did Ridley Scott or anyone in the crew see the mini-series? However unlikely, the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar. Okay, the budget is _much_ lower in the Norwegian film, but given that, it&#39;s a really well-done piece of work from the desolate age of Norwegian movie-making, which incidentally lasted until the 90s.

As noted by other reviewers this is one of the best Tarzan movies. Unlike others however, I like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like. Plus the exposition is needed so we know why Harry wants to go back into the jungle. In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made.This occurs when Harry&#39;s safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. The pre-censorship production values add a lot of realism, genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle. The film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, an accurate account of how horribly treated the native Africans were by their white employers. In addition sexy Jane, thousands of elephants , some great sets and two chetas! Not to be missed an adventure classic.

When this series aired I watched most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of &#34;The Fugitive&#34; and &#34;The Incredible Hulk&#34; where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems. In this case the hero&#39;s problem is his progressive aging in reverse. I liked what I saw of these shows. The acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife. Problem is: They cancelled it before it had a chance to end. (either that or I missed the last episodes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They never got a chance to wrap up the story either, knowing it had been cancelled. Poof it was just gone. However, like I said before I might have missed the last episodes. But my proof to the contrary is this: I rented the tape. Where I left off in the series. The lead character&#39;s wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving King&#39;s famous organization the Shop. While getting away hero is kidnapped. It ends with his friends realizing they have to go save him from the Shop. The end. Last episode. On the video: His wife does not die but escapes the fire with him. Right when he should get nabbed by the Shop, he and his wife share a weird moment then phase out of existence. Abrupt, silly and cheap to the extreme. They just wanted to put this video out and decided to tag on an ending not caring how bad it was. They might as well of just shown some stock footage of the first atomic bomb detonations. Almost Pythonesque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show did have a cool opening title sequence set to the David Bowie song of the same name

I just re-watched a few episodes of this series on very poor VHS tapes that I recorded the series on. I&#39;m glad I did, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ramona is based on the children&#39;s books by Beverly Cleary and follows the adventures of the title eight-year-old (Sarah Polley). She has fun with friends and family and gets into trouble much like many eight-year-olds. All ten episodes are pretty good. &#34;Mystery Meal&#34; kind of grosses me out as a vegan, but it&#39;s funny seeing the parents trying to get their kids to eat cow&#39;s tongue! And any episode that mentions Godzilla Versus The Smog Monster twice can&#39;t be all bad. I like &#34;Ramona&#39;s Bad Day&#34; even more. Although it&#39;s disheartening to see Ramona going through a rough day, she does imagine herself getting revenge on her friend Howie&#39;s uncle (a pre-Psi Factor Barclay Hope), who always teases her. &#34;The Perfect Day&#34; is also good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lori Chodos plays Beezus, Ramona&#39;s sister. I swear I&#39;ve seen her on something else, but IMDb doesn&#39;t list anything besides this show. Unfortunately, this series is not on DVD. Why is every crappy show made these days on DVD except something I&#39;d actually like to buy? An injustice if there ever was one!

A fine Martino outing, this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the jig-saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate. Just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists, enjoyable twists, it has to be said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal locations. A super finale set upon Aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all.

One of the better musical bios. Dennis Morgan is great as the singer/composer Chauncey Olcutt. The supporting cast is very good, especially Andrea King as the glamorous Lillian Russell. The turn of the century atmosphere is the perfect setting. The technicolor is excellent. A simple plot, but the movie just makes you feel good. Morgan was always underrated as an actor and a singer.

Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie, but I resisted. I don&#39;t know what Ridley Scott intended, but I learned that in the army, women get as stupid as men. They learn to spit, to insult and to fight in combat, and that&#39;s also a waste of time (in my opinion). And, anyway, what the hell was that final scene in Lybia? Are they still fighting Gadafi or is it that it&#39;s easy for everyone to believe islamic people are always a danger?

In 2004, I wrote the following statements on an IMDb message board when a user wondered if The Best Years of Our Lives was a forgotten movie: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** To me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule. I think in many ways &#34;The Best Years of Our Lives&#34; is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the US in the mid-1940s after WWII. I believe &#34;Coming Home&#34; and &#34;The Deer Hunter&#34;, both released in 1978, were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in &#34;The Best Years of Our Lives&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was in college around 1980-81 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie still packs a wallop and I&#39;m very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time. *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on IMDb and AFI. Also, though it was in competition with what eventually became a Christmas classic, It&#39;s a Wonderful Life, arguably, The Best Years of Our Lives&#39; Oscar wins, including Best Picture, were very well-deserved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve just seen the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years, The Best Years of Our Lives is still a powerful, beautifully acted and well-crafted motion picture.

A reasonable effort is summary for this film. A good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not as good as she could have given, other actors were just dreadful! A terrible portrayal. It wasn&#39;t very funny and so it didn&#39;t really achieve its genres as it wasn&#39;t particularly funny and it wasn&#39;t dramatic. The only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance. Target Audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages. A very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all well and people were left confused as to why the film wasn&#39;t as good and who the target audiences were etc. However Maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of capability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.

Ultra-grim crime drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of &#34;Home Sweet Home&#34;. Tonally, it reminded me of Billy Tang&#39;s &#34;Run and Kill&#34;, although it&#39;s not as polished as that. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an engaging, flawed bit of mayhem about a Cambodian loner, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While fleeing the scene, he kills the partner of cop Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father, so Sam begins an insane, obsessive manhunt for Pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence. There must be something in the air lately because I&#39;ve never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as I have lately. This is grim, nasty stuff, which is why I&#39;m so partial to it, and I applaud its downbeat vibe. It&#39;s visually arresting and the sound design is very unique. Dramatically, everything spirals downwards until every character finds him- or herself in a world of screaming pain. A subplot involving Pang&#39;s attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine act of grotesque surgery.

eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, wherein characters run from realm to realm, landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where it&#39;s leading them. Within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games, calling into question which reality they arrive from is the &#34;real&#34; one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it&#39;s not spectacular at hiding the fact that it&#39;s not going to reasonably answer to a true reality, instead tossing the idea of whether it&#39;s real or a video game into question even up to the end. I&#39;m not even sure Cronenberg pretends that twist won&#39;t be there, it&#39;s so incredibly obvious in a sense it&#39;s kind of disconcerting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this film though is its base nature, in a sense. Cronenberg is questioning reality AND criticizing game play. Yet the same things that he uses to criticize game play makes him revel in it: the violence, the discontinuity, the lack of focus and in a sense, the pixellation even if there isn&#39;t such pixellation in the film. I have once heard someone state that Cronenberg&#39;s violence is actually a criticism of hyperviolence in media, but he hides that well with the fact that he derives such incredible pleasure in ripping new orifices into humans, animals, and amorphous piles of biological sludge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What IS brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of video game conceits (not being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes, relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that don&#39;t make sense, only a few people around where it feels there should be many and vice-versa, all of that stuff) along with the motif of penetration. It definitely deconstructs the video game reality in a way that&#39;s nauseating and absurd, but it does it even better by replacing video game electronics with literal &#34;pods&#34; of biological matter that squirm and shift and are, frankly, disgusting to the one of the most horrifying degrees. For what it&#39;s worth, this film causes a reaction in you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what for? It criticizes virtual reality, but it&#39;s a movie: it is its own virtual reality. It seems to criticize the banality of video game plot lines and character design, yet it maintains that banality. It definitely seems to worry over whether killing a video game character is more okay than killing an actual human being and how video games can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in real life, and yet I say again, it derives the utmost pleasure from ripping people, objects, beasts, things, and organisms into bloody shreds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So whereas it has a key focus of angst, it doesn&#39;t really do anything with it, not really. Only what it does do is present that angst in such an original way it can&#39;t really be denied its own moment of splendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a sense, it&#39;d be much easier to just hate this movie for being gory and violent, because there&#39;s no good reason I can see for loving it and yet I can&#39;t disregard it as mediocre or bad. It&#39;d be easier to simply not be able to take it, but since I can, there&#39;s nothing I can really do with it. I do believe it is a little excessive, it really didn&#39;t need to go as far as it went, but Cronenberg&#39;s intentions are so mixed up and confused I don&#39;t know if that was Cronenberg&#39;s flaw or Cronenberg&#39;s point, and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s really any way to figure it out except maybe ask him directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--PolarisDiB

This film is too good for words. Its so unbelievably great and funny and true to life. You just know from watching this that the person who wrote this has DEFIANTLY felt the way that Jip and his friends do through the film. It was my life at one point and I would rely on coming home to watch Human Traffic ever night before I could even think of going to bed. I think you just get so loved up with the characters and their life style. Of course, this film wouldn&#39;t be for old people more around the age of 16 to 22 I guess. There is defiantly nothing wrong with this film and it will have you in stitches all the way through. It doesn&#39;t have a particular story line to it. The general idea is a weekend in the life of older teens in London and what they get up to. The places they go, the people they meet, the drugs they take and the experiences they have. You have to get this movie on DVD never mind just watching it, you have to have it!!!

I saw this drama by cable TV. Although I saw just two series, I love this drama. I&#39;m waiting for more series will be aired by cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it describes horrible, absurd situation in a prisoner&#39;s camp, this one shows us an indomitable spirit, warmth, friendship and humanity. They don&#39;t know whether they can survive or not, but kept their hope strongly without being discouraged by adversity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this movie is not realistic like other war documentary, but I don&#39;t want to blame for it. It makes me believe the strong will of people in the most difficult situation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Private Bill&#39; , especially, this episode touched deep in my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember every scene. I always hate mathematics. But after seeing this drama, I can understand something about mathematics... Mathematics is his connection between past and present, also symbolizes eternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Time, light and memory framed in a circle.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other victims of war, he lost his lover by irresistible fate. I&#39;m immersed in his time and memory as if I experienced same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He experienced the great loss but he has pure passion of study.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He started his study in the camp, his joy of realize,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe his dedication of study sustained him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it several times, but the meaning of this film never faded. Every time I saw it, I feel same deep emotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Their songs are beautiful, harmonious,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t listen OST.

I own this video as well as the concert version of the musical with Patti Lupone and George Hearn with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. George Hearn is fantastic in my book as are Angela Lansbury and the composer, Stephen Sondheim. This musical is operatic in scope and shows much ingenuity in composition. I certainly hope that this VHS becomes available on DVD!! Hearn&#39;s performance is spookily sympathetic. The one annoying performance is the young woman who sings the role of Joanna. I believe this performance was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, rather than on a Broadway stage and am not sure that the minimalist set was utilized in New York, as it was in this production. But I found the scaffolding being dragged across the stage to be quite effective to &#34;portray&#34; the streets of London. I highly recommend this movie.

This is the last Dutch language film Paul Verhoeven made before going on to make mainstream Hollywood films &#34;Basic Instinct,&#34; &#34;Robocop,&#34; and &#34;Total Recall,&#34; among others. He sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet Gerard Reve, an annoying self-centered writer with a morbid imagination. Gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a Literary Club meeting in sea-side town an hour or so from Amsterdam. Verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how Gerard&#39;s imagination twists reality. Asked if writers are a bit close to insanity he admits when he reads the newspaper &#34;and it says &#39;boom&#39; I read &#39;doom,&#39; when it says &#39;flood&#39; I read &#39;blood,&#39; when it says &#39;red&#39; I see &#39;dead.&#39;&#34; When he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it; &#34;I lie the truth.&#34; He accepts an offer to be the overnight guest of the Club treasurer, a beautiful wealthy salon owner. As he gets to know her and learns her husband has died, he begins to imagine she is &#39;a black widow.&#39; Is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess? This is a psychological drama and in recounting which of these old films have stuck in my memory, I figured out is my favorite gender. Looking at his body of work it is seems to be Paul Verhoeven&#39;s too, and he is a master in making us question our own understanding of reality. It&#39;s a nice change of pace from the usual Hollywood fare. I saw it in 1983 and it is a film that &#34;stuck.&#34;

If Jean Renoir&#39;s first film &#34;Whirlpool of Fate&#34; first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards. Put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great &#34;Grand Illusion&#34; and &#34;Rules of the Game.&#34; This is beautifully filmed, with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the film&#39;s interiors, and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well, particularly from Werner Krauss&#39; Muffat. But the glamorous and sultry Ms. Hessling, who at first appears as if she might give Louise Brooks a run for her money in vampishness, never goes beyond a one note, selfish harlot portrayal. Perhaps this is in part a problem with the script, which does seem to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions; not having read the novel I&#39;m not really clear on whether the choices were well-made or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the differences between Nana&#39;s suitors are well-drawn, and I particularly liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelo&#39;s Vandeuvres -- the tragic understandings that each seems to have of his ultimate fate and their sympathy with each other, particularly in the scene at the bottom of the enormous staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat, and we wonder if violence will erupt -- this and other gleanings of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help give the film the depth it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far from his greatest achievement, and for me probably just shy overall of &#34;Whirlpool of Fate&#34;, this is still well worth seeing for Renoir fans or those interested in silent cinema generally.

(Possible ?? spoilers included, but nothing critical given away.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just watched this classic low budget movie on video, and was knocked out by the level of energy present on screen. All the actors do themselves proud, especially John Daniels, must see another of his films. Not only does this movie boast great performances, but manages stylish sequences, like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see shards of glass falling into a swimming pool which erupts from the impact of the fallen man, i love the way slow-motion photography was used in 70&#39;s cinema, dreamy and hypnotic. Cool and witty black dudes spout great one liners while slimy seedy lumps of white trash come to unpleasant ends. I love it, my rating 10 / 10. If this ever comes out on dvd, count me in for a purchase.

This is one of L&amp;H&#39;s shorts most frequently cited as the first &#34;real&#34; L&amp;H teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew Philip, whom he&#39;s never seen. At first Ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he&#39;s behaving during his medical exam, but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow he&#39;s supposed to be greeting. He has been told that Philip is a good boy, but he has one weakness--women. Mumblethunder and Philip set off to go home, but their journey there is continually interrupted by Philip breaking into a little dance every time he sees a woman, then chasing after the woman. Huge crowds gather each time this happens, not so much because he&#39;s chasing skirts, but because Philip himself is also wearing a skirt (a kilt). Finally Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailor&#39;s shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants, but Philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts. There are lots of laughs all around. It&#39;s also nice to see a short like this because the boys aren&#39;t exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is pretty much his usual character, but it&#39;s such a joy to see Stan acting so differently from his usual man-child character. It shows he wasn&#39;t a one-trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when he got the chance. With a run time of 19 minutes its short and sweet, providing classic one liners which still have me in stitches.

Diane Lane, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson &amp; Thomas Jane.....Not a bad cast in my opinion however they were totally wasted in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no real direction, there were no unusual turns, in fact the whole movie was very predictable from start to finish. Mickey Rourke had a really annoying sidekick who did nothing but irritate you from the start. Rosario Dawson was totally wasted and there was hardly any point in even having her character in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do believe this is one of those straight to DVD movies that everyone will forget about very quickly which is a shame as the movie could have been so much better.

I don&#39;t really post comments, but wanted to make sure to warn people off this film. It&#39;s an unfinished student film with no redeeming features whatsoever. On a technical level, it&#39;s completely amateur - constant unintentional jump edits within scenes, dubbing wildly off, etc. The plot is completely clichéd, the structure is laughable, and the acting is embarrassing. I don&#39;t want to be too harsh: I&#39;ve made my share of student films, and they were all awful, but there&#39;s no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safe assumption that - much like the cast - positive comments are filmmakers, friends, and family.

My first &#39;Columbo&#39;. Rather enjoyed it. Great format, and Peter Falk&#39;s character extremely good...wonderfully quirky, he can take his place next to Poirot, Miss Marple, and also the likes of Marlowe and Rick Diamond. I can see why this series has such a following. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a professional musician, I HAVE to say a few things. First of all, a conductor who merely produces these pedestrian performances of the most basic examples of the repertoire (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Strauss Waltzes, Beethoven...) is never going to have a house like that or fame like that or cars like that, much less be called a genius. And the conducting that the actor does is so bad as to be laughable. No orchestra would take him seriously. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several little things too, such as his rehearsal of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (why rehearse it when they&#39;ve just performed it for TV? Any orchestral musician would be able to play it in his or her sleep anyway...). His instructions to the ensemble are downright nonsensical, and when Columbo asks Blythe Danner what &#39;quasi fantasia&#39; means, she says it&#39;s &#39;Latin&#39;. It&#39;s Italian, as are the vast majority of musical instructions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, no two great musicians would EVER have the following interchange: &#34;Play something.&#34; &#34;What should I play?&#34; &#34;Chopin&#34;. Music is their job and passion, they know it well. Something far more specific would be asked for, and offered! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know. I should get out more...

I saw &#39;Begotten&#39; last night, and I&#39;m of two minds on the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one hand, I appreciate it for being the total invert of a Michael Bay film. No dialogue, extremely stylized grainy B&amp;W photography, some of the most genuinely horrific imagery ever set to film, and a very compelling use of sound (which nobody else seems to have really picked up on yet). It&#39;s a reflection on a theme, and it dares go where most filmmakers do not not only in terms of images, but of production and concept. It&#39;s a movie that most people don&#39;t understand, and if you read through these comments you&#39;ll find a lot of people whose lack of ability to figure this film out results in them shrieking about &#39;pretentiousness&#39; with the fervor of a gibbon rattling the bars of its cage at feeding time. It genuinely shocked and disturbed me, and the last time a film managed to do that was a while ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other, this is a thirty-minute short that sprawls out to over an hour and a half. I understand that there might be artistic merit in using repetition and monolithic pacing as a bludgeon, but in this case it just doesn&#39;t help everything hang together. Imagine being approached by a ragged man on the street who grabys you by the shoulders and says something that completely confounds the core of your being... but then, instead of leaving your shattered and gibbering in his wake, he just keeps talking and talking and talking. By the end of the movie, I found myself glancing at my watch now and again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not entertainment, people. This is disentertainment. This is how you deprogram people who just watched &#34;Glitter.&#34; If you watch movies to be entertained, this will frustrate, confound, and possibly anger you. You don&#39;t approach &#39;Begotten&#39; like a chocolate cake you want to eat because it tastes good. You approach it like something on the menu you have never heard of before, something you see furtive glances of through the kitchen door, something that&#39;s dark and glistens and twitches on its platter; something you order not because it will taste good, but because you just have to know what it&#39;s like.

So many films are now in a Genre described as &#34;Comedy/Thriller&#34;, as was this one. A fine cast, interesting premise, but what an unpleasant film to watch. Into Hemp films? Then either &#34;Saving Grace&#34; or &#34;Lock, Stock...&#34; are far more enjoyable films. Rating: Just 2 out of 10 Roach Clips

First off, I knew nothing about &#39;Mazes and Monster&#39; before I watched it. I had no knowledge of the Role-playing controversy behind it or the fact that it was a Made-For-TV movie. When I looked at the cover (the updated DVD one) I seriously thought it would be another Fantasy adventure like &#39;Legend&#39;, with Tom Hank as the nerdy hero from 1980s earth entering a mythical world to save a princess from an evil maze filled with monsters. Sounds exciting, right? That is what the cover suggests to you at first glance. I was given this movie as a gift, obviously under the same premise because my aunt knows I&#39;m into action movies with a medieval myth theme. And it has Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. So I popped this movie in, expecting a feel good movie with Tom Hanks in a 80s special effects world that would be good for a laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No! None of this happens. Now before I continue I will confess, I am a nerd but I have no interest in Role-playing games. That is all this movie is about so my interest in the content is lukewarm at best. And M&amp;M (copyright infringement?) is not even a feel good role-playing based movie with lovable geeks that uses their imagination to enter a world of awesomeness. No! This is an Anti-Role-playing movie that must have been made by some Religious folk (the same people who also think Barney is the work of Satan.) I understand, Satan is a crafty fellow but I don&#39;t think he is desperate enough for soul to lull RPG lovers into worship him. This movie is THEE anti-gamer movie. This is what I get from this movie: it hates RPGs and not only does it make fun of the people engaging in Role-playing but it makes poor Tom Hanks a mental patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom had an excuse to talk to a volleyball in &#39;Castaway&#39;, poor guy was alone but Tom somehow made his insanity fun and you literally saw the Volleyball as a lovable character through Tom&#39;s good acting. I wish I watched that movie instead of this. In this movie, Tom is attacked by a make believe dragon creature (it looks like a poorly made mascot for a RPG team) and has a split personality that is creepy at best. Tom&#39;s acting only exceeds to make you feel bad for his character and nothing else. I get that the poor guy lost his brother and is not right in the head because of it so the movie does win points for being intentionally tragic. I am not one for films that exploit mental illness and the ending to &#39;M&amp;M&#39; made me feel like cr*p. Luckily I watched &#39;Hudson Hawk&#39; afterwards and got a good laugh before my soul was crushed any further. Yah, &#39;HH&#39; surpasses &#39;M&amp;M&#39; by . . . a LOT! This is not one of Tom&#39;s better films. In fact it is thee most depressing movie I&#39;ve ever seen him in (Even &#39;Saving Private Ryan&#39; is not this depressing). I walked in hoping to watch a feel good movie and I ended up feeling the exact opposite. If you want to watch a sad (both emotionally and visually) movie then by all means watch this. If this movie is to convey a message, it is this: &#34;Don&#39;t play RPGs if you are Cuckoo for Coco-Puffs.&#34;

Previous comment made me write this. It says that Muslims are blonde and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment just says that this opinion can be made by racist.Look,race is nothing.I&#39;m color blind.I look like Pierce Brosnan but I&#39;m no Irish. So what?I might add that I am not 100% Serb,that I have some Austrian and Croat blood within me but whats the point.I&#39;m dark, half-breed?Is that so? Anyone using racial prejudices with such bad intent like Lantos(producer9and director is racist for me.Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman they are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yuggoslavia. Hope they will be all in hell but that wont return our dead relatives back. I am proud of being Serb and I am proud of my cousins, Austrians,Croats,Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (yes I am from Serbia and I have multiethnical family).This movie doesn&#39;t show sufferings of Serbs or Croats within Sarayevo,terrible terrorism of street gangs,Muslim extremism.I add: I kneel and pray for all innocent sisters and brothers Muslim,catholic or orthodox, killed in this war.This film is manipulation with our misery,false humanitarianism&#39;s which doesn&#39;t help at all.It helps Lantos to fill his pockets with more doe,alright!

The only way to truly understand and relate to the characters in this movie is to have experienced the situations your self. To a lot of people this movie is almost mock-biographical, a sort of snapshot of one weekend in our lives. (I have done about 85 percent of the things in this movie and witnessed the other 15 percent, usually all in the same weekend) For me and others I know it is nice to have this movie to look back on because other than a few pictures of people we sort of remember and nights that are patches and blurs, this movie is our generations &#34;Studio 54&#34;, a piece to add to our scrap books to look back on and smile. Personally I&#39;m glad those days are past but it is great to watch this movie and say &#34;I remember when.........&#34; Thank you Justin for making this mock-biography of one weekend in my life.

A plane carrying a rich scientist&#39;s daughter goes down in thick wilderness. He assembles a group to go and find her and the others, but the rescue party soon suspects that something is stalking them. Then ulterior motives for the expedition are revealed and that only adds to the already existing tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is a decent idea and a take on the popular Sasquatch legend was bound to wind up on film sooner or later. However, the film&#39;s direction breaks a fundamental rule of horror/thriller directing and that is showing too much too soon. Of course the audience knows there is something stalking the characters, just read the title! But showing what should have been the film&#39;s kicker that early just ruins most of the suspense and, as a direct result, much of the fun. The film also lacks a good atmosphere and there are almost no landscape shots that show the expanse of the wilderness, but there are plenty monster point-of-view shots that add nothing to anything. They actually knock off &#39;Predator&#39; quite shamelessly. The low-budget horror film &#39;Wendigo&#39; did what this film tries to do much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the character tensions and a non-cliché ending manage to make up for this rise above the crap pile, but it is still poor and given the premise and potential, very disappointing. --- 4/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rated R for some violence and profanity, but it&#39;s pretty tame compared to most R-rated horror.

I am a huge fan of Northern Exposure. Men In Trees is a complete knock-off of Northern Exposure. There&#39;s the city-folk from New York stuck in a remote backwoods town (Marin Frist / Joel Fleishman). She immediately doesn&#39;t hit it off with a local (Jack Slattery / Maggie O&#39;Connell). The town only has one pilot who is not often available. Ther is only one radio show. And the entire show is about quirky people with sincere and odd relationships. Too many parallels. Just like Northern Exposure except one obvious demographic has been altered in each character. I&#39;m bored. Give me something new to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, the writing is pretty good. But if this was a school project, it would certainly have earned the stamp of plagiarism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps people who love this show were sheltered from the dedicated creativity and hard labors of Joshua Brand and John Falsey.

this 2.5 hour diluted snore-fest appears to be one of the poorest excuses for an adaptation, ever. clearly possessing a budget allowing for breathtaking location shooting in greece, the monies might have been better spent working out a cohesive script with character development and motivations clearly outlined; especially since bill has gone through the trouble of doing this already. the portrayals lacked passion &amp; direction, leaving the viewer debating whether they should bother to care about the demise of the protagonists at all. which brings out another point-the main character of the original work, prospero, is not so named in this rendition despite the fact that most other characters&#39; names are used. enchantment and magic are also markedly absent from this particular piece. in fact, all aspects that made the stage version of &#39;the tempest&#39; full of wonder and intrigue have been sucked completely from this convoluted version about a self-absorbed, pompous arse who can&#39;t figure out how to care about anything beyond the blur of his wealth and power. over all, a lackluster effort at best and a brutally poor imitation of the intended inspiration.

my friends and i watched this movie last night. it was pretty incredible. by all means, this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen. at first, it was tolerable. it stunk of BAD IMPROV but it was pretty friggin hilarious, despite the scenes being too long &amp; drawn out and the terrible quality (i read $400 budget above... sounds about right) of the film itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the biggest problem came from the lack of a script; with a background in improv, i know how hard it can be to keep scenes short &amp; efficient. what happened in this film was that the actors were left to improvise the scenes and they didn&#39;t know when to stop, they just kept going for ages on stupid topics. at first i thought this was because the movie was short and they needed long, useless scenes to flesh it out. as the movie progressed, i realized it was just a really bad movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there were a lot of parts where i could see that the film maker had a really good idea for a shot but not the resources (or talent!?) to pull it off effectively. a lot of the scenes were taken from a single shot (cause, you know, improv) for what felt like a really long time. so boring! if you can stand to put up with and hour and a half of terrible improv, watch it. it&#39;s really funny at parts but also really stupid and annoying. the acting ranges from alright to absolutely terrible. it seemed like the only good parts were the parts that really had nothing to do with the main plot; the ballsy kid who swore lots, the barbershop, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but yeah. painfully bad. like, i was literally hurting. after an hour or so, my friends and i just got bored and left.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is full of references. Like &#34;Mad Max II&#34;, &#34;The wild one&#34; and many others. The ladybug´s face it´s a clear reference (or tribute) to Peter Lorre. This movie is a masterpiece. We´ll talk much more about in the future.

I really can&#39;t remember who recommended this, but they said it was one of their favorite films. It is certainly a strange one - like rubbernecking at a highway accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone said that truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth here is something to see. I really can&#39;t understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year. How can you improve on this? The aunt and cousin of Jackie Kennedy remove themselves from New York Society and hide in the Hampton&#39;s. In the process they become recluses and what is best described as &#34;crazy cat ladies.&#34; They would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by Jackie. This film was done after that rescue. All during, you couldn&#39;t help but think, &#34;how bad was it before?&#34; It&#39;s a look at high society from the darker side, and it is utterly fascinating.

Walter Matthau is wonderful as the &#34;philandering&#34; dentist Dr. Julian Winston whose frequent fibs to girlfriend Goldie provide textbook proof of the dangers of lying. Goldie Hawn&#39;s touching kook Toni Simmons certainly deserved to win her Oscar. Ingrid Bergman&#39;s work as the stiff-as-starch nurse Stephanie is also touching to watch as she comes out of her shell, slowly and nervously. This is a great movie to watch in the springtime, or any time for that matter. It&#39;s very underrated; I never heard about it until I found it in the video store, and what a find!

Will Spanner (David Byrnes, the fifth actor to play the role in the series) stumbles onto another bizarre case, this time involving vampires rather than the usual witches, warlocks &amp; demons (he&#39;s at the hospital to check on his friend&#39;s son who got hurt in a hit and run when they wheel a girl who&#39;s been attacked by a vamp in). He brings in Detectve Lutz to help out with the case which revolves around a clandestine vampire organization trying to get a business merger to go through to let them legally own all the blood banks in the world or some such nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot of this movie pretty much takes a backseat to the nudity &amp; simulated sex scenes. (As is to be expected from this series, i guess). So complaining about the lack of good acting, or compelling plot-line, or even convincing characters, I suspect, would fall on deaf ears. If you&#39;re watching this film, you don&#39;t care about such &#39;frivolities&#39; and just want some &#39;action&#39;. Sadly on that front the film fails as well. All the woman are attractive enough but the way the scenes are filmed are just atrocious. Making this more or less an exercise in futility in every conceivable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Candy: Both Kimberly Blair &amp; April Breneman show everything; Ashlie Rhey shows full- frontal; Aline Kassman &amp; Mai-Lis Holmes only shows their breasts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: D

I was absolutely blown away by John Cassavetes&#39;s Opening Night. It&#39;s the first movie of his that I&#39;ve seen that seems to be on a bigger scale, thus it feels more mainstream, but it still doesn&#39;t feel as if he grounded himself any more than he has in his previous films. That is perhaps what makes it so intense. There is also something undoubtedly cathartic about watching this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s about what in fact Cassavetes has made a staple of his career, an ideal that he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here expressing it in front. Rowlands&#39;s character, middle-aged stage actress Myrtle Gordon, cannot bring herself to play her role in the upcoming production as written so she uncalculatedly follows impulse after impulse, resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage, until she finds the right one. It&#39;s a daringly abstract premise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a movie that does not fail to capture the innate steering that one goes through during an emotional cleansing. No one understands why Myrtle does many of the things she does, and it is seen and even portrayed as something destructive, yet it just might be the best thing for her. It may be a cleansing rather than a breakdown. A withdrawal, a cocoon, a rebellion, it all culminates into a meltdown. Cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch, which is that early on, she is ardently arguing that she has nothing in common with her character, yet she is in quiet but emotionally corroding fear that the opposite is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last scene, the climactic performance that Myrtle shares with a character painfully estranged from her who is acting with her, is one of the most interesting, hilarious, hard-hitting, enlightening, and enjoyable moments I&#39;ve ever seen in a movie.

I first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting. On top of that, I&#39;m a fan of Max Fleischer&#39;s work, and this started out with the look and feel of his 30s cartoon. With both of those, I thought it would hold my interest. I was wrong. Just a few minutes in, and I had the fast forward button down. I ran through it in about 15 minutes, and thought that was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, I read some of the other reviews here and figured I didn&#39;t give it enough of a chance. I recorded it again and watched it through. There&#39;s 75 minutes of my life I&#39;m not getting back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t believe there aren&#39;t more bad reviews. Personally, I think it&#39;s because it&#39;s hard to get to the 10 line comment minimum. How many ways are there to say this is a waste of time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts, profanity, and puke jokes. The characters are flat. The parody of &#34;Swinging the Alphabet&#34; is lame, essentially cobbling the tune, getting through A - E, hitting the obvious profanity a &#34;F&#34;, and then having no idea where to go. The trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesn&#39;t work the first time, let alone the following ones. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the board, the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to &#34;out-South Park&#34; Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what is and isn&#39;t funny. This might be amusing if you&#39;re high. Otherwise, it&#39;s not.

I think the film makes a subtile reference to rouge of Kieslowski, as the whole atmosphere gives me a feeling of red. It seems to be that a lot of the backgrounds contain red, think of the tea-room f.e. I also think this is one of the greatest movies of the last years.

If you like horror movies with lots of blood and gore, tons of jump-scare moments and unrelenting, escalating scenes of excruciating death, then look elsewhere. If you like quiet, moody, thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread, then Wendigo is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughtful, stressed out George, his psychoanalyst wife Kim and their young son Miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city. On the way up, George hits a stag with his car. The hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that George has ended their chase. In particular, deranged hunter Otis takes it personally. He follows the family to their vacation home, making sure they see him. He spies on George and Kim as they have sex. He fires through their windows with his rifle when they aren&#39;t home, letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return. When Kim takes Miles to the drugstore in town, Miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case, carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag. A Native American man tells Miles that this is the Wendigo, a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry. Miles takes the figure home with him, already haunted by the death of the deer the day before. That afternoon, when he and his father go sledding, George is shot and Miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsed...or is he just in shock, and imagining the whole thing? Hours later, George is rushed to the hospital and Miles, still clutching his statue, either faints, dreams or goes on a vision quest, in which the Wendigo returns. This time the angry, flesh eating god - part tree, part stag and part man - is hunting for Otis, who has finally gone over the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wendigo is a beautifully made film, almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees. Okay, so the monster itself is kind of fakey-looking, but it&#39;s a small flaw, more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film, and the eerie backdrop of the silent, snowy countryside. The performances are great, particularly by Jake Weber as the moody and thoughtful George and Patricia Clarkson as his sweet but no-nonsense wife. They are a happy couple with their share of common problems, and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful. Watching this film is often like watching someone&#39;s home videos, so realistic are the performances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is not for everyone. A lot of people may find themselves totally bored, waiting for the hideous Lovecraftian Beast and bloody revenge that never come. We can never really be sure if the Wendigo even exists, seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also, later, through the eyes of a madman. This is more a psychological drama than a horror film, but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror.

This is one of those movies that apparently was trying to ride the martial arts wave craze. Kind of like Billy Jack I guess. However, whereas Billy Jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one unless you consider some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such. We are introduced to the star who is described as having learned Judo in the marines. I was in the marines and while they are pretty established in boxing, I really don&#39;t remember any emphasis on Judo. As a result the antagonist, James Macarthur, makes reference to the Judo when he offers an excuse for why he, a state champion wrestler was so easily defeated. Lame.

This is another great movie I had the good fortune to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker et al). Back in the late 80&#39;s I was a relative newcomer to the genre and only really new about the big three JC, SH &amp; YB. I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect when I payed my hard earned money to see this in a &#34;Triple bill of Classics&#34; at the old Scala. I need not have worried, I was left breathless by this movie. If you&#39;re a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and haven&#39;t seen this movie, do so NOW!

Tediously long dreary cinematic waffle. I couldn&#39;t believe how bad this film was. I watched it merely because of the numerous people who gushed about it on this site. Was I watching the same film? The entire episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that happened in Garps&#39; past affected his (or anyone else&#39;s) future and no-one was affected by their past. I think it was Socrates who said about plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect, then it shouldn&#39;t be there. Obviously, the director didn&#39;t know this rule and, so, stuffed his &#39;work&#39; with one dire scene after another. Even the plane crashing into the house was unexpected, it wasn&#39;t a surprise, but it was unexpected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth mentioning that at the time of writing this (1st Dec 2002), even though many people say it is one of their favourite films, no one has bothered to add a memorable quote. The reason being that there simply aren&#39;t any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t waste your time watching this, watch a plank warp instead.

So you&#39;ve got a number of models on an island, and one by one they&#39;re picked off Agatha Christie-style. We get somebody lost at sea, pushed off a cliff, poisoned by a solvent, driven off a cliff, blown up, etc. Nothing terribly graphic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before any of that starts, one woman inexplicably has a dream of a killer in a weird human face mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owner of the magazine is a sleaze who had an affair, and somebody had photos taken of her before she was of age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it&#39;s all about business, or something,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s an 80s style montage of a photo shoot, most of the bathing suits being one-pieces, surprisingly. A couple are fairly translucent. There&#39;s camera clicks during the montage where the frame of the camera appears as a white square or rectangle within the picture. The photographer is rather bad at framing!

Once in a while you get amazed over how BAD a film can be, and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap. There is absolutely No talent included in this film - from a crappy script, to a crappy story to crappy acting. Amazing...

&#34;Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark&#34; is a sort of &#34;Harper Valley P.T.A.&#34; with touches of the supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) walks off her job as television horror movie hostess after the new station&#39;s owner gets fresh with her. She&#39;s now relying on a Las Vegas show to carry her through, but learns she needs to come up with more money to get the show started. Things look hopeless to raise that money until she receives notice of her aunt&#39;s death, which then takes Elvira to Massachusetts for the reading of the will. A house in need of repairs, a dog, and a cookbook are all that is left to her by her aunt, and again it seems Elvira is having trouble coming up with the money for the Las Vegas show. The adults of the small and narrow minded town make things worse by making things more difficult for Elvira. Only the local hunk (Daniel Greene), and a group of teenagers will befriend her. Elvira&#39;s Uncle &#34;Vinnie&#34; (W. Morgan Sheppard), presses to make a deal with Elvira for the cookbook, but Elvira soon learns of her powerful heritage that includes spellcasting, and a couple very effective casseroles. Elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined to get his hands on it knowing of its power. Elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the town&#39;s old charge of witchcraft, and the showdown between her and her uncle. The plot is pretty simple, but the humor and well developed characters keep it moving at a nice pace. &#34;Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark&#34; is full of cute, gross, bawdy, and clever humor carried through by the many sight gags, puns, props, songs, and parodies. The film&#39;s touches of the occult make this one of the best horror parodies ever made. It is a well made film with terrific acting by all performers; including Edie McClurg, and Jeff Conaway (of &#34;Grease.&#34;) There are also nice special effects. Many people (including myself) wondered if the Elvira character could carry a feature film, and the answer is delightfully, YES!

This movie has been promoting in everywhere in Spain with a huge publicity campaign, after watching it, you realise that someone has stolen your money. Paz Vega is horrible as Carmen, she´s not natural at all and she looks like she´s making a fashion magazine cover in all the shots (&#34;the best&#34; is when she as an andalusian woman ...¡can speak basque and fluently¡, Leonardo Sbaraglia is much better than her as Jose, but the story is very slow, the plot don´t work, and the screenplay is really very very bad...I think Penelope Cruz (the film was written for her)would have been a much more credible and sexy Carmen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of time and money

hi.. I consider Just Cause one of my favorite Sean Connery&#39;s movies, it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the Cast, especially Connery..it also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies, so the dialog is pretty good in this one.. It also has one of the best scenes in movies ever, when Sean interviews Ed Harris&#39;s character in prison is just fantastic..i enjoyed this one a lot and i can not recommend this enough, really do not miss this one ! Do not pay attention to the negative reviews stating that the last 30 minutes suck, it was as intense as the rest of the movie, i really find Just Cause a very entertaining movie..

Contrary to its title, this film offers no spice and thus audience is subjected to a tasteless dish. All Humor appears forced, theatrical, mechanical, staged, reminiscent of those Pakistani plays available on video, including even the mannerisms. Everybody is screaming, shouting and doing odd things for no reason. The premise looks interesting as it is a straight lift from Hollywood&#39;s &#39;Boeing Boeing&#34;. John Abraham who is so natural in almost all his films is a complete misfit here. If we keep morality factor aside, even then the bizarre events looks trite. Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced stalwarts try hard to lift the film by being natural but in vain. At least, the characters of three girls should be made contrasting in order to bring some interesting elements but sadly here too all of them appears those brainless, buxomed bimbettes (3Bs) who talk, behave and even scream in quite similar fashion. The major hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at his same home pretending that they will never get to know about each other? Just to do some Sex, what else? The same could be done in hundreds of other ways. Therefore so much dramabaazi for no reason is not something audience will digest easily. But surely, great flesh show and tempting promos always gives such films a great initial. Now for those who call it a situational comedy, I call it a pathetic taste. Sense of humor of such cinema going audience is surely gone corrupted and demented to the extent that they are connecting to a sadistic, weird and maddening type of humor, where it is not the characters that they laugh at but rather at themselves and at their own frustrations that look how senseless we have become that in order to laugh we have to bear with such things?

What a gargantuan pile of malodorous ordure! Ye Gods where to even begin with this one..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, mix crap acting (including one bloody infuriating woman who speaks as though she&#39;s either a) chewing painfully on some ice cubes or b) has just woken up after having undergone some extensive root canal surgery), editing that would appear to donate that the celluloid was cut and spliced via the utilisation of an angle grinder, some truly hopelessly choreographed martial arts &#39;action&#39;, a script that has ostensibly been written by a two year old and some of the most hideous and intrusively loud background music ever committed to any film and hey presto you have Death Machines aka The Ninja Murders (although note that surprise, surprise  there are in fact no actual ninja anywhere to be found in this sodding travesty!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, if ever there was a cinematic equivalent of a particularly vehement bout of dysentery, then this must surely be it! Avoid at all costs!

Oh, man, how low serials had fallen as by 1952! This dull thing is precisely the kind of serial that annoyed Annie Wilkes (from Misery). Not only the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that weren&#39;t there in the previous chapter (and that COULDN&#39;T possibly be there - tell me that when the baddies blow up the plain in episode 7 to 8 they wouldn&#39;t see the characters jump), but I think this serial has the World&#39;s Record of Stock Footage. I mean, most of it is stock footage! And not just from another serials (apparently all the flying sequences come from King of the Rocket Men, and the cool &#34;molten rocks&#34; scenes of episode 2 to 3 is from Adventures of Captain Marvel), but from itself! The whole &#34;trip to the Moon&#34; sequence (which is probably the shortest ever, it&#39;s 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave Earth&#39;s atmosphere) from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8! And episode 10 is ALL scenes from previous episodes! (Ever wondered why MST3K never did episodes 10, 11 and 12? Well, they had to stop after 9 so they didn&#39;t have to do the whole thing again!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t get me started on the science factor. Prepare to see the sunniest Moon ever! And Moon men that can not breathe on their own world? What were they smoking? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if this is not enough, it&#39;s too talky and the stunts (usually the best thing in serials) are few and far. Visually-wise, am I the only one who thinks that Commando Cody&#39;s bullet-shaped (or is it lemon-shaped) helmet is totally ridiculous-looking? The Rocketeer&#39;s was way cooler, no matter how bad that movie was (and man, was it awful). The tank-like vehicle isn&#39;t much better, it looks like a bunch of kids made it for Halloween. The only positive thing I can think of about it is that the actor who plays the hero is homely instead of the usual muscular hunk (hey, everybody has the right to be an hero!), but then he&#39;s so unappealing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even worth watching for nostalgia&#39;s sake. See Captain Marvel instead. 2/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(BTW, check out the Memorable Quotes section for a real Women&#39;s Lib pearl).

I don&#39;t care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you can&#39;t expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russo&#39;s character to coach the cops on how to be &#34;TV cops.&#34; Those are by far the funniest scenes. If you want to be entertained and just sit back for a laugh, then watch this movie.

At the name of Pinter, every knee shall bow - especially after his Nobel Literature Prize acceptance speech which did little more than regurgitate canned, by-the-numbers, sixth-form anti-Americanism. But this is even worse; not only is it a tour-de-force of talentlessness, a superb example of how to get away with coasting on your decades-old reputation, but it also represents the butchery of a superb piece. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind. Yes, it was a theatrical confection, and it is easy to see how it&#39;s central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen, but it still worked terrifically well. This is a Michael Caine vanity piece, but let&#39;s face it, Caine is no Olivier. Not only can he not fill Larry&#39;s shoes, he couldn&#39;t even fill his bathroom slippers. The appropriately-named Caine is, after all, a distinctly average actor, whose only real recommendation, like so many British actors, is their longevity in the business. He was a good Harry Palmer, excellent in Get Carter, but that&#39;s yer lot, mate! Give this a very wide berth and stick to the superb original. This is more of a half-pinter.

I grew up watching, and loving this cartoon every year. I didn&#39;t think they would be able to take a half hour (20 min!) cartoon and make it a movie. They did it. With FLYING COLOURS! Fabulous, funny, heart warming, effective movie!

Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a dying, lonely old nut who lives in Morhenge Mansion with some servants and tells his doctor friend, &#34;Don&#39;t try to doctor me, doctor! I&#39;m disgustingly healthy!&#34; He invites his nieces and nephews to his home and warns them they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by &#34;shrinking the brain&#34; (?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***SPOILERS***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morteval/Karloff ends up dying, and murderous &#34;toys&#34; (designed by his dead brother) start killing off the relatives. A mini cannon fires real bullets into a guys face, a life-sized knight in armor attacks with an axe and a dancing Sheik stabs people with a knife. One guy getting strangled makes some hilarious faces. At the end, Julissa and her boyfriend find Karloff is still alive and hiding out in the dungeon where steel gates seal off the room. He plays the recurring organ theme music (sort of a death rattle used for the killings), the brother&#39;s spirit starts talking (&#34;The whole house will go with me!&#34;) and the mansion goes up in flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This senseless mess is too dark, boring and the stupid dialogue never matches the lips.

Last fall (of 2001), I took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie (Mark Hoeger). His vast knowledge of filmmaking, his ability to dissect any scene of a film, and his winning of an Academy Award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director. When he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called &#34;Full Ride&#34; and was in the post-production stages, my interest was piqued. However, that would be the last I would ever hear of that film project. Until last week...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I saw in a TV listing that &#34;Full Ride&#34; was going to be showing on the WB network. This immediately raised a red flag, as I can&#39;t help but associate WB with teensploitation shows such as Dawson&#39;s Creek, Charmed, etc. PLUS, the fact that Full Ride was going to be released straight to TV wasn&#39;t too flattering in itself. But, nevertheless, I set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teacher&#39;s creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two hours passed and the end credits began to roll, I thought long and hard about what I had just seen. What I had just seen was a typical WB-quality show stretched out to the length of two hours. In fact, it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the WB network. Critiquing this movie will basically be like critiquing a typical WB show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to begin? The characters are shallow, the story is cliche in every sense of the word, the scenes are completely contrived, and the character development is forced and unbelievable. This movie just screams `unoriginal.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main character, Matt Sabo, is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who plays solid high school football as a fullback, but then fizzles off into a life of crime. He is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail. Obviously, without much of a choice, he agrees to play football with an all-star football team, but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then comes the love interest. Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe). She is actually a likable character, as opposed to the ever-so-abrasive Matt Sabo, so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first. But, of course, the inevitable comes to pass. She falls for him, changes his attitude towards everything, and all seems good and happy. But now it&#39;s time for conflict!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier in the movie, Amy makes it clear to Matt that she doesn&#39;t want to score with him, because it would be `shameful&#39; to her and her mother. This is much to Matt&#39;s dismay, and his football buddies (yes, they eventually warm up to him) who bet him he wouldn&#39;t get any. But, of course, Matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he&#39;s not all about the nookie. Here&#39;s where the exciting plot thickens. If you don&#39;t want me to ruin this surprise, then skip ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[BEGIN SPOILER]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt finds out from some local guys that apparently Amy Lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the All-Star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria (which is baffling in the first place) and make it to the big city. Suddenly realizing he&#39;s been used and that his love was a sham, Matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before `the big game.&#39; Amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time, but he&#39;s too hot-headed to buy it. So what will Matt do? Will he take her back? Or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all-round jerk? I won&#39;t ruin the super-ultra-surprising ending for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[END SPOILER]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if I somehow got you pumped up for this movie, please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm. This movie is an uninspired version of `Varsity Blues&#39; or `Summer Catch.&#39; And that&#39;s not saying much. There&#39;s hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about. So what do you have left? Not a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture Hoeger painted of Nebraska through this film. It seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in the small towns, but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow. The characters&#39; high hopes for making in `the big city&#39; and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated, and it only further cements the stereotype of Nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities. I am unsure of whether or not Hoeger&#39;s intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight, but I think he ended up with a very shameful product. If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light, he should have taken a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop for his films, Hoeger integrates it into the plot of Full Ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he&#39;s shooting, that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider. If Hoeger actually lived here, you&#39;d think he&#39;d know better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am completely disappointed in Hoeger&#39;s first big film, and I hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought-provoking.

This PM Entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make John Woo say, &#34;Enough already!&#34; Of course, it isn&#39;t nearly as beautiful as Woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. When his wife is framed for murdering the Governor by a team using a look-a-like cyborg, it is up to Eric to clear her name. Wilson gets to pull Van Damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger. Why the Academy failed to take notice is beyond me. Being a PM production, there are tons of car chases, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) and shoot outs. I particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck. My other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in Don&#39;s simulator. It is merely a chance to show off some cheapo LAWNMOWER MAN effects circa 1995.

Much in the same way Frank Miller and his Sin City comics used black and white to express itself (and its film noir influences), so does Christian Volckman with Renaissance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the year 2054, in Paris. In the tradition of science fiction, the future is a bright, sparkling multi-teared jewel. This is a jewel in a setting of misery, inequity and darkness; bright and beautiful on top with a dark underbelly beneath. One of these &#34;bright&#34; people at the top, a research scientist from a very large and influential global company (Avalon), is kidnapped. The well known and efficient, Captain Karas (voiced by the new James Bond himself - Daniel Craig), is assigned the task to find her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot and layout is not overly original. It is heavily influenced by film noir, Gibson&#39;s Neuromancer and other detective stories, along with movies like Blade Runner, Sin City, Fritz Lang&#39;s Metropolis and Minority Report. There is the main plot, surrounded by other possible sub-plots that all connect at the end. It is not hard to figure it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie&#39;s strength and originality is in its intense visual presentation. Paris is an intricate array of levels and sub-levels. At its base is the more primitive industrial infrastructure. As the city rises, so does its architectural complexity and luminescence. Yet in this structure, the top does not equate with elevation of human ideals and behavior. Paris has been intricately animated and laid out in brilliant black and white. The movie is closer in spirit with Sin City (the comics) then Sin City the movie was with its source material. This is done all the more easy, because it is still remaining in relatively the same medium; animation. Much in the same way as a Scanner Darkly pushed the visual aspects of story telling, so does this. The light and dark, black and white creates an atmosphere of contrasts, as well as visual ambiguity. Right and wrong, black and white can lose all meaning at the same time it is right in front of us. The movie proves how black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In keeping with the spirit of the movie, I can be both critic and fan. I can love and loath in the same light. It is definitely an experience I recommend for lovers of the visual arts. So pour another Black and Tan, enter the void and enjoy the ride.

this is an excellent movie i have been watching it since i was 6yrs old with my big sister. it is the type of movie that u can watch over and over again and still laugh, smile, and cry every time with out ever getting bored of it like other movie&#39;s. it is a movie that will live on forever through generations of family. i love it :) when ranking from 1-10 in my case i would rate it easily 9.9 every time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itis a film about the change of a girl (baby) and her first boy-friend (Johnny)their relationships within the family, the changes in baby&#39;s and Johnny&#39;s view of the world during their relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRTY DANCING WILL FOREVER LIVE ON AS A TIMLESS CLASSIC. thank-you sorry though for only the short comment.

I caught this movie on the Sci-Fi channel recently. It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go. Two guys (one naive and one loud mouthed a**) take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky, make-shift tank/truck hybrid decides to play cat-and-mouse with them. Things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker. What makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie, unlike so many others. The two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase/suspense scenes. Nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror/slasher buff. Definitely worth checking out.

When it comes down to fairy tales, Cinderella was the one that made you cry the most. poor Cinderella is a girl who had her whole life stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepsisters and a slave-driving step-mother. and thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, We got to witness Cinderella in animation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the story begins, Cinderella and her father are lonely, and rich beyond their needs. to share his wealth and to give his daughter some sisters, Cinderella&#39;s Dad marries a woman, but then dies soon after. the stepmother, only seeing dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her gorgeous step-daughter, Cinderella.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for many days, Cinderella is a slave to her step-mother and her step-sisters. she has hope however, thanks to her friends, the mice of the home (sounds like Cinderella wasn&#39;t playing with a full deck.) she has hope that one day she&#39;ll find her prince. the chance eventually comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10

An insane assault on viewers senses. This is a mish-mash of assorted Hindi and English movies - poorly done. The name carries over from a 70s&#39; multi star cast, which the 2002 version also boasts of. The story is taken from the 70s&#39; Sunil Dutt/Reena Roy starrer - &#34;Nagin&#34; and visual effects taken (a horrible attempt) from The Matrix, Terminator 2 and Mission Impossible II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in a college environment (Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Kumar, Manisha - college kids!!!???!!), Manisha Koirala is the victim, who mistakes a fatal assault on her by two students as a collective effort on the part of our heros. As it turns out Manisha is a Cobra (Nag) snake reborn as a girl in this life and her mate from the previous life, now a super powerful-all-and-any-shape-assuming (Ichadhari Nag) - Munish Kohli, is out looking for her in this life. Manisha appeals to him to avenge her violation and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins the mad killing spree, where the avenging lover starts singling each male of the group, with increasing powers and tricks with successive attempts. The effects are extremely cheap, with computer generated skeletons, morphing bodies and motorcycle stunts completing the farce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carry over from Nagin includes Raj Babbar playing a catholic priest who provides temporary relief to our boys with a more &#34;Religiously correct&#34; multi-religion locket (the original Nagin only had an &#34;Om&#34;) . Sunny Deol plays Manisha&#39;s love interest in her current life and the ultimate saviour against the all powerful Munish Kohli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music and songs are below average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid if you don&#39;t fancy cheap thrills.

I really don&#39;t see how anyone could enjoy this movie. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk. It probably would have been better if the director hadn&#39;t spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn&#39;t that noteworthy. Another thing I didn&#39;t really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after. I don&#39;t know how folks bleed over there in Japan, but I hope they have plenty of blood donors.

Wow! I just don&#39;t even know where to begin with what made this movie so awful. Maybe I should start by just saying that during a &#34;heated confrontation&#34; between the antagonist and protagonist, I had to leave the theater because I was laughing so hard. Yeah. The acting really was that bad. The acting was not even the worst part though. The plot was almost entirely shown in the previews. The characters are all grossly underdeveloped. The dialogue and &#34;dramatic moments&#34; are ridiculous. The bad guy is a caricature of an out of control, power drunk, sadist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey the actors are pretty, so guess that was supposed to make it all better.

Cuban Blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way. I actually watched it while sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise. It details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the Socialist regime came and took the property of the boy&#39;s father. The majority of the film is the boy&#39;s coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. A class A film with fine acting and directing. This is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists. It is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their triumphs. A good film worth watching several times annually.

I know it&#39;s not original, but what the hey? What else can be said about it? I feel unutterably silly just paying any attention at all to &#34;From Hell It Came&#34;. The movie makes the important political and social issue of fallout from atmospheric atomic tests seem a matter for joking and dismissal, not the concern and alarm being raised by scientists all over the world at the time.

It&#39;s not often that a TV series grabs me right off the bat; a recent chance download of the pilot for Surface had me glued to my seat for the entirety of the episode, after which I immediately set out on a fevered search to learn everything I could about this wonderful series. To my chagrin, I found out it had been canceled after a mere 15 episodes, despite its strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews. Such a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I&#39;ve acquired the remaining episodes, and found the first 5 or 6 to be among the best television I&#39;ve EVER watched. Just fantastic from start to finish, and as another reviewer commented, I LOVED how they ended every episode with a huge finish. I imagine watching it each week I would&#39;ve been screaming with tension and just captivated, desperately waiting for the next episode to be released. Growing up, I always heard that was how early serial movies used to do it, ending with a huge cliffhanger to get the crowds back into the theater for the next episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it seems for some reason or another the suits decided to kill this off, and apparently the people behind the show must&#39;ve seen the writing on the wall, because after episode 6 things definitely take a turn for the worse. I wouldn&#39;t say the episodes actually become BORING but a lot of the plot elements become a bit more clichéd, and I&#39;ve got to say, the final episode really left me feeling cheated. I just wish the show&#39;s creators were given a fair chance. The *ONLY* other show that left me feeling like that was the first season of Stargate SG-1, which just resonated tremendously, feeling very &#34;true&#34;, soulful and made from the heart. Surface was a great series, and maybe one day, some well-heeled TV lover will see all the outpouring of emotion about the show&#39;s cancellation, and bring back this show. One can hope, at least. :)

Would someone explain to me when the Ghoulies learned to speak? This was a horrible film, I loved &#34;Ghoulies&#34; and &#34;Ghoulies 2&#34;, but what&#39;s this? Unless you want to kill yourself, please stay away from &#34;Ghoulies 3&#34;. On a scale of 1 to 10, &#34;Ghoulies 3&#34; gets a 1!!

In Cinema Retro magazine #2,it is revealed that Mark Lester&#39;s voice was actually dubbed by a 20 year old female, Kathe Green. Although Leste was considered perfect for the title role, director Carol Reed was not at all pleased with his singing abilities. The secret was revealed by on a 2004 UK documentary titled &#34;Oliver! After They Were Famous&#34;. Greene was paid 400 pounds for her work and she had to agree to keep her participation secret, as did Mark Lester. They kept their word and only revealed this fact as part of the TV show decades after release of the film. For the record, Mark Lester retired from acting and is a practicing osteopath in England.

For those who like their murder mysteries busy, this is definitely the one to see, as it is chock full of interesting and suspicious characters, most of them wealthy Long Island socialite types. As the star detective, William Powell is alternately starchy and inspired, behaving at times as if he and his suit went to the cleaners and got pressed together. Mary Astor is very lovely here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powell had made a career out of playing the lead character, Philo Vance, in a series of movies made at a couple of studios over several years. In-between these films he developed into a somewhat offbeat romantic lead, at times even essaying gentleman gangster roles. Already middle-aged, he was stuck in somewhat of a career rut by the time this one came along. As with so many early talkie stars, it seemed that his time had come and gone, that he was fine for early Depression Prohibition-era films, but that with changing times he was perhaps too mature and dandyish to endure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kennel Murder Case, directed by the criminally neglected Michael Curtiz, is one of the last of the &#34;old Powells&#34;, while the next year would herald in the first of the new ones, The Thin Man, the success of which would catapult its leading players into the Hollywood stratosphere. In Kennel we can see the movies still in a somewhat stiff, ritualized pattern, as the camera does not move much, with the acting, like the presentation, tending toward the theatrical. There&#39;s no harm in this approach, though, which has its charms. It gives the movie a baroque quality.

You can see that if the flick ain&#39;t directed by his brother, this is the best he can do. And sad to say, his best just doesn&#39;t cut it. &#34;Ice Cream Man&#34; is a very bizarre horror film, that&#39;s a real blast to watch if you&#39;re in the right mood. In the wrong mood, it has been known to cause people to lash out violently at loved ones, so please, watch with caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clint Howard stars (Does anything really star Clint Howard though?) as the &#34;evil&#34; &#34;psychotic&#34; &#34;bizarre&#34; (Yes all in quotes, he&#39;s not quite any of these, but he&#39;s getting close) ice cream man, who tortures the local children with bomb pops that are really melty and ice cream that has chopped up humans and dogs in them. Ick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the plot&#39;s really just an excuse to show of the...well, the...um, well it&#39;s a plot. Oh wait, I know! It&#39;s an excuse to show off all the loser actor cameos! There&#39;s Jan Michael Vincent and Lee Majors II (The sequel?) as cops tracking the elusive man o&#39; ice cream. And even Doug Lleyweln appears as a supermarket clerk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better than that, are some of the bizarre goofs in the film. I really like the fact that for some reason, instead of hiring a fat actor to play the unhappy &#34;fat&#34; kid of the group, they just make this one kid wearing padding under his clothes. And the entire premise that anyone would by scoops of ice cream from a ice cream man. Who buys ice cream scoops from the ice cream man? Then there&#39;s the entire psychiatric ward scene, in which Jan Michael Vincent&#39;s acting ranges from mildly interested, to bored beyond the state of consciousness. These are the cops who also scour the Ice Cream Man&#39;s place for clues but manage to complete gloss over the ice cream truck (where, of course, the various bodies and such are kept). Oh well, better luck next time troops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Howard himself overacts like he&#39;s making sure people two towns over can see and hear him. It&#39;s all just plain dumb. And fairly fun to laugh at in the fine tradition of The Pumaman or Gymkata. You&#39;ll have a GOOD laugh with the right sense of HUMOR. I love that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Good Times was a groundbreaking comedy about the first nuclear black family living in the Chicago projects. Whether or not, you live in the inner cities, ghettos, suburbs, or rural countryside, this show is still a treasure to watch and observe a family being just a family rather than a show about a poor black family. But they don&#39;t dwell on it. They find humor and have strong family values and morals. Despite the story behind the scenes, this show was worth keeping on the air except I didn&#39;t like them killing off the father which I agreed with Esther Rolle who fought hard to keep the family together. But despite all the fights behind the scenes, Good Times was a show about a family. We all loved JJ&#39;s dynamite and his antics. We watched Janet Jackson&#39;s Penny grow up a little. This show was groundbreaking to show despair in drugs, gangs, and alcoholism. Without being to preachy, The Evans always tried to do the right thing rather than do something wrong to get out of the ghetto.

This movie was poorly conceived, poorly written and poorly acted. All of the characters were two-dimensional. It was a real amateur attempt. The movie was fundamentalist Christian propaganda. The Christian characters are holier-than-thou and they are without a shred of compassion for the skeptic or the undecided characters. The movie was a real &#34;gotcha&#34; for both the skeptic character and myself as a viewer, putting us in a very uncomfortable situation. I complained to the theater management and was given a free pass to another movie. I remember another movie on a similar subject, &#34;The Rapture,&#34; starring Mimi Rogers, that was much better and professionally done. I think I&#39;ll watch &#34;The Rapture&#34; again. If you attend &#34;Unidentified&#34; and don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t say I haven&#39;t warned you.

Another fun, witty, frothy RKO musical with Astaire and Rogers, FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming film. While it lacks the stand-out great tunes of SWNG TIME (although the final number &#34;Face the music and dance&#34; is one of the team&#39;s best and rightfully so), it is hugely enjoyable, as these two could virtually do no wrong together in the 1930&#39;s. Once again, the plot is lightweight and forgettable, but watching Fred and Ginger dance together is sheer heaven. These two conveyed more romance and magic in dance than many couples in films do in a huge love scene. While there are better Fred and Ginger musicals, this is certainly a must-see.

Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed up &#39;The Baron&#39; with this, a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted &#39;The Six Million Dollar Man&#39;. It was a favourite of mine when I was a youngster, and I enjoy watching it still. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had an unmistakable on-screen chemistry as Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while the luscious Alexandra Bastedo pouted her way through her role as Sharron Macready. The late Anthony Nicholls made a wonderfully gruff Tremayne. By far the best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner&#39;s own &#39;The Interrogation&#39; compared favourably with &#39;The Prisoner&#39;. I regret that there was never a second series; the concept had so much life left in it. Would Craig and Richard have been competitors for Sharron&#39;s affections? What if Tremayne had learned of the Champions&#39; powers? Did the Champions have any other abilities other than those we saw? We never found out, alas.

Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. He takes out his problems on his older sister, whom he murders at the beginning of the film. This is just the start of things to come from Michael Myers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who&#39;s been studying Myers for years. He knows that something is different about him, something mysteriously evil. This evil will not be contained, and it cannot be stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an escape from an institution, Myers tracks down his younger sister. If he kills her, there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy. But he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way. He manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer. But this one started it all, sort of. If you think about it, most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have Freddy Kruger or Jason chasing around half naked girls. Well, if it wasn&#39;t for Halloween, those characters wouldn&#39;t have haunted our dreams when we were children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halloween&#39;s director, John Carpenter, got a lot out of the horror movies of the &#39;50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late &#39;70s. This films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film may seem cliché today, but back then there wasn&#39;t much out there like this. It&#39;s been copied from and ripped off of, but Halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie. It still gives you chills listening to Carpenter&#39;s thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy Michael Myers.

By no means is this movie as bad as &#39;Perfect Stranger&#39;, but it just wasn&#39;t funny. It couldn&#39;t stick to one type of comedy - it jumped from SNL, to Adam Sandler-esquire, to romantic, to little guy scores big, to slapstick, to &#39;Loser&#39; (the movie) types of comedies. Although there were some pretty funny slapstick moments (the fall down the hill), no one was very particularly funny or outstanding in any way. &#39;Schindler&#39;s List&#39; was funnier (and felt shorter). you never knew if Andy Samberg was supposed to be in high school, a college dropout, or just a loser living at home with his mother - Sissy Spacek, in her worst choice of roles. And poor Ian McShane, THE serious actor if I only had to name one, is given crap to read into the camera. The story drags and is completely predictable up to and including the end (no spoilers here in case Adam Samberg&#39;s mom wants to see it). Don&#39;t spend ANY money going to see this movie, and maybe Lorne Michaels will get the hint and start producing quality (Yes, Wayne&#39;s World and Tommy Boy are quality) movies.

How good is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right movie for her... too bad she&#39;s completely out role. I haven&#39;t read the book by Jane Austen, but I can&#39;t believe it is so superficial and the characters aren&#39;t much more than caricatures. It wasn&#39;t probably that easy to reduce in 2 hours of show about 600 pages of the book, but I had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups. I was taking a sigh of relief every time I saw an actor who didn&#39;t overstep the mark of overacting (a couple of times).

I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock&#39;s father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he&#39;s an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all. There are excellent points made by both sides about the cost of war vs.the price of peace and certainly does remind one of some of the best of the WWII and later era movies. Those are not my favorite genre but I certainly would recommend a fan of such to view this episode through that filter. You&#39;ll see it holds up. I&#39;ll never understand why Sci-Fi gets so little respect--the best drama comes out of placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.

At 2:37, a high school student commits suicide. Not shown who has taken their lives or reasons known, time skips back to the start of the day. From here we follow six separate students; Marcus, Melody, Luke, Steven, Sarah and Sean. Each student is struggling with their own moral dilemmas, all reaching boiling point, hitting to an end for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing a friend to suicide, and surviving his own suicide attempt, writer/director Murali K. Thalluri has created a revetting drama focusing on teen life and the horrible act of suicide. Suicide has been a topic that has been kept in the shadows, 2:37 is Thalluri&#39;s attempt to bring it to light. If you have been touched by the act of suicide or anyone who has, 2:37 becomes all the harder to view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With heavy and hard subject matter, Thalluri also tackles everyday teenage life crisis&#39;s. Sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullying, friendship, Thalluri manages and shows them in an extremely realistic manner. The factor on Thalluri&#39;s talent is his subtlety. He respect his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered through at sometime. It verges near documentary at times, it has such a painful realism; the interviews with each character spliced through the film only heightens this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2:37 has a distinctive similarity to Gus Van Sants film Elephant. While the core of each film is different, both tackle teen life. Like Sant, Thalluri utilizes long tracking shots, with time skipping back and forth, to show each characters interaction from different perspectives. A defining point to Elephant was its ethereal ambiance. With spare conversation, little development of characters, and the long tracking shots, Sant created a haunting and mesmerizing atmosphere to a coming dread. While there resides this dread in 2:37, the emotional connection to the characters reaches a higher level Sant couldn&#39;t reach. As time goes by, each characters fragility creeps out, dragging you along their emotional roller-coaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real hit in this film comes with the inevitable suicide, foretold at the very beginning. The hard part about this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort we have as an audience watching someones life end in a gruesome fashion. Though many films that have shown suicide, gloss over the act or romanticizes the act. Thalluri shows the pain and agony involved with this act and that its not the best solution. With unknowns in the leads and their first major roles; Teresa Palmereach, Frank Sweet, Joel Mackenzie, Marni Spillane, Charles Baird and Sam Harris all show immense talent and promising acting careers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compelling and revetting, 2:37 is an absolutely unmissable film.

Very few so called &#34;remakes&#34; can be as good as the originals. This one crosses that border with flying colors. Just a remake, I don&#39;t think so! I saw it theatrically at the age of nine, and was completely entranced and enraptured by the film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart. The earlier film is also a enjoyable and entertaining movie, but admittedly it tends to feel more like a nature documentary than a film. This update is more epic and cinematic. Still, I thoroughly recommend both films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is certainly a must-see for an animal lover. We have the wise old Golden Retriever, Shadow; the sharp, sarcastic Himalayan cat, Sassy; and the young, fun-loving American Bulldog, Chance. The animals are brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche, Sally Field, and Michael J. Fox, respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is virtually nothing offensive in the film. There is a bit of scatological humor, but nothing extreme. No hard violence, save a few tense scenes involving a pounding waterfall, an angry porcupine, and a dark railroad shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilarious, scary, moving, and above all real, it surprised me to see that this film didn&#39;t win any awards, not one. Nevertheless, I will have to say this is just as good as some of the Best Picture nominees nowadays.

this movie is quite bad, aggressive, not played well, not directed well, seems low budget, low quality,emotionaly weak and disconnected. after watching earlier comments, went to see it, but if u try to compare it with apocalypse now, PLATOON, or any others, u&#39;r really off the tracks. this movie looks like a 60&#39;s old and purely made film with cast of grown neanderthals, not to mention (or actually do), not paying attention to details like changing rounds, low budget fireworks and all sorts of poorly filmed characteristic. is watchable though, if u&#39;d like to see it as an early development of the movies document.. not to go back!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s - afterall, the guys are quite alright.

I was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb. I just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at A.I.R. as it was know as back then.Thank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and I don&#39;t have to sit through the whole thing. It was more of a big party than a movie set but hey, the pay was good.Attention to detail was not a strong point for this one, but who was going to know.The funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal speed.A lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed I suppose to shave cost and time.But every one was having such a good time who cared!

I got this as a turkey movie and was I not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting - overall even though many have been in other movies it is clear that they had to work hard to act this bad so constantly over this entire movie with out accidentally letting slip some degree of acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot - being generous I could say that the scriptwriter did originally start with a plot but but did his best to ignore it. the plot broke down faster then a Chinese knock off computer &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scrip - now that was an abomination of nature. it failed to flow with any rhyme or reason. the majority of the lines by the characters were at best pathetic to imbecilic. the script worked hard to make sure that no character managed to get to be considered memorable. I have watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special effects - ROTFLMAO!!!!! They were short bus special &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directing - until you can come up with your own directing ability copy the style of your favorite directer otherwise you will only make failures like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is good to know that your friends/family have been giving you 10 stars for this movie

Tom Hanks like you&#39;ve never seen him before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, &#34;The Angel of Death&#34;. He is a hitman for his surrogate father John Rooney(Paul Newman)an elderly Irish mob boss. Sullivan&#39;s young son(Tyler Hoechlin)witnesses what his father does for a living and both are soon on the road for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan&#39;s wife and other son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter/photographer willing to kill Sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of photos of dead mobsters. Filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the 30&#39;s. Sometimes the pace bogs down, but then a burst of graphic violence sustains the story. Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and the bonding of a secretive man and his young son. Other notable cast members are: Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks again proves to be excellent in a very memorable movie. Make room for some Oscars!

I saw this Hallmark television movie when it originally aired. I lost interest in the story because a character was said to be a witch. I just was not in the right frame of mind to watch this film. But Hallmark stands for the best, quality films. Now, there is a reason to give this film a second look. Clive Owen who plays &#34;Damon Wildeve&#34; just might have a chance to be selected as the next James Bond 007 when Pierce Brosnan passes it on. Clive Owen might have to wait until the year 2008. The other reason is the female lead is Catherine Zeta-Jones is now a celebrity (she was an unknown at the time) and became an Academy Award winner for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 2003. Joan Plowright as &#34;Mrs. Yeobright&#34; is also in this film. I like the opening line in this film: &#34;Deliver my heart from this fearful, lonely place. Send me a great love from somewhere or else I shall die, truly I shall die.&#34;

I&#39;ve tried to remember the name of this movie for years and years. Finally, read something today, 03/09/2005, that mentioned Stacy Keach&#39;s name, and it reminded me that I had seen a movie that he was in in 1974 at the Atlanta Film Festival, so, I did a Google search for Keach&#39;s movies and found The Gravy Train. We were supposed to see Duddy Kravitz at the film festival, but for some reason they were unable to show it, and instead substituted The Gravy Train. We were terribly disappointed that we weren&#39;t going to be able to see the much hyped Duddy Kravitz, and had heard nothing of The Gravy Train, and have heard nothing of it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I recall we were pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was, and as I recall, it was quite humorous. Would love to find it on tape.

Basically, &#34;Caprica&#34; is the Cylon origin story. The premise of the show is interesting. However, the writers follow so many story lines and clog it with too many POV characters that it bogs down the storytelling. The plot creeps at glacial speeds dissipating what tension it might have had. In any given episode, little or nothing happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip. Unfortunately, his only working prototype is driven by the AI version of his dead daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide bombing caused by Soldiers of the One (STO), an underground monotheist extremist group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Joseph Adama (father of &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34;&#39;s Commander Adama) is struggling to hold his family together while searching for the AI version of his daughter (who also died in the bombing) in a Machiavellian virtual version of Caprica (which strongly resembles 1930s Chicago). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the vapid writing, Caprica suffers from a similar problem as many origin stories. We already know how it ends (i.e. the Cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).

I truly fell in love with the characters. They were very down to earth but each and every one of them had a hidden dark side. Sort of a mystery. David Graysmark, himself, was an enigma. The secret fears and just secrets in general that he had. There was a whole side of him that the other characters knew nothing about and it left the audience either wondering or assuming. There was always a part of this man that he would keep hidden away, yet he&#39;d share a little of himself too. He was the strong male lead character and I admire that type of character. Billy Moses himself is an incredible actor who could do just about any type of part! He&#39;s an amazing talent and a good man. His fans love, respect, and support him endlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this show he&#39;s gone onto many other projects and has stretched his acting ability quite a bit more and quite well. Kudos to him and all the other actors from this show for doing such an excellent job! I wish them all well. I wish the series would&#39;ve continued on! It&#39;s such a shame it didn&#39;t!

Everyone involved (and the audience) should seek out &#34;The Candidate&#34; to see how good this movie could have been. What happened the South American story? What were Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw thinking to allow their roles to be cardboard cut-outs. Up to now I have liked every Gene Hackman performance and/or movie. He was either disinterested (which I can hardly believe) or dreadfully miscast. I have also liked and defended Richard Gere (and been vilified for it). But here he had no &#34;power&#34;. He was never intimidating and only occasionally persuasive. All in all I was very disappointed. I really expected much more from this director and cast. If you can&#39;t find &#34;The Candidate&#34; watch &#34;Wag the dog&#34; again or even &#34;Bulworth&#34;.

This movie looked like it was shot with a video phone, it had very little plot and unnecessary nudity. The movie never really came together or made much sense and for a movie like this, of course, there were some unnecessary boob shots. The director was obviously trying to make the movie subjective and different, but it just never gave enough information on what was even really going on, even in the end i was left with a mixture of anger and confusion. Confusion from the lack of plot, and anger because i wanted my two dollars back from blockbuster and an 1.5 hours of my life back. They should have a payment program for people who accidentally rent this movie.

As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.

This is one of four 1970s movies by TV writer Lane Slate about sensationalistic murders in small towns. They feature likable TV personalities as police chiefs and quirky characters as town regulars, including light-touch love interests. The others are: They Only Kill Their Masters (James Garner, 1972); and The Girl In The Empty Grave and Deadly Game (both Andy Griffith, 1977).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alda&#39;s is set near Vermont (&#34;Mount Angel&#34; next to &#34;Horse Creek&#34;); the others in California, Garner&#39;s at seaside (&#34;Eden Landing&#34;) and Griffith&#39;s in the mountains (&#34;Jasper Lake&#34;). All try to capture the feel of a small town, to move at a relaxed pace among comfortable characters, and to tell a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turn to it. On that level, they are somewhat entertaining (that they were often re-run itself suggests they have some appeal). But they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue, slack pacing, bland settings, flat or exaggerated characters, and off-putting, forced attempts (often juvenile or crude) at color or humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alda&#39;s and Garner&#39;s are the most serious about story, characters, pacing, and tone. They have the best supporting casts, though Alda&#39;s is put to better use; the Griffith casts pale in comparison. Alda&#39;s has the best director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Shocking&#34; has some surprise and drama. The killer&#39;s method is inventive. The tone is more even, and the dialogue more natural, than in Griffith&#39;s. Alda&#39;s film does not suffer like the others from smug big-city transplants to the town or from hokey, exaggerated local characters, both of which come across as figments of a Hollywood scriptwriter, not as genuine (the worst offender is the Griffith movies&#39; pipsqueak, mumbling moron &#34;Whit,&#34; who, we are told, tried to hook a jeep up to and make off with a trailer serving as a temporary bank branch, dragged away the dock for the police boat, stole tomatoes from a farmer&#39;s truck only to get nothing for them, and filled out $11 on the withdrawal slip of &#34;Spiro T. Babylis&#34; only to be discovered by the teller). Mercifully absent is the clunky, heavy-handed repetitive-style dialogue from the Griffith movies (&#34;You going to lunch?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m going to take out the boat.&#34; &#34;You going to take the boat to lunch?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m not going to lunch.&#34; &#34;You&#39;re not going to take the boat to lunch?&#34;; &#34;There aren&#39;t any fish in this lake. Why are you fishing here?&#34; &#34;It&#39;s illegal in Horse Mountain.&#34; &#34;It&#39;s posted here too, you&#39;re breaking the law.&#34; &#34;Some law. There aren&#39;t any fish in this lake.&#34; &#34;Then why are you fishing here?&#34; &#34;I told you, it&#39;s illegal in Horse Mountain.&#34;; &#34;Please call me Lloyd. My name is Lloyd.&#34; &#34;Okay, Lloyd...&#34; &#34;Call me Lloyd. That&#39;s my name. My name is Lloyd.&#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Alda is too low-key and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a small-time police chief, certainly not a red-hot lawman in demand by a rival town. Slate has the character admit as much, when he comes late to the scene of a by then obvious clue, as a result of an accidental name recognition. Rather than detect or investigate, Barnes strikes out blindly in emotional denial. His secretary Lasser feeds him a key clue (&#34;Why didn&#39;t I think of that,&#34; he says!). An embarrassing funeral scene, plus a plot contrivance, leads to another gift clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse, Barnes is more interested in deriding the military-style helmets of the county police sent to help him (Deadly Game also suggests Slate has something against the military) than leading them or his own men effectively. He allows a late murder by incompetently guarding a known target. Barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer fleeing one crime scene, without drawing his gun or trying to take control. Again, he is ineffective, and nearly killed, in the climactic scene, which results from multiple errors on his part that are only partially corrected, by accident. The erratic Northeastern accent that Alda affects does not help believability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plot holes. Why would the killer strike after all these years? And committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible. But they are nothing compared to later ones -- a couple together, a shopkeeper in his store during business hours, a fully clothed deputy seated in his office and, unbelievably, his dog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alda&#39;s movie also suffers from some offensive elements that Slate injects into all the movies. Barnes first appears in a motel clerk&#39;s bed. He then treats her rudely at every turn and insults and tries to avoid her kids. This, and talk about the female doctor, smack of a crude, mean-spirited pattern (Garner&#39;s film has been described as &#34;sleazy,&#34; including a scene where he and a deputy laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy in the car with her. Griffith&#39;s feature an ersatz Ropers routine, in which the woman embarrassingly tries to coax the man into &#34;the supply closet&#34;; a gratuitous locker-room-type exchange with a deputy in discussing a young woman&#39;s car accident death (&#34;Did you take her out?&#34; &#34;I took her in once.&#34;); a reference to bank teller &#34;Bernice&#34; as &#34;swollen-up in places&#34; and to &#34;sticking a pin in&#34; her and to &#34;hating&#34; and firing secretary &#34;Maude&#34; because she was &#34;too hairy&#34;; a description of the female doctor&#39;s practice as &#34;two stirrup tables and a flashlight&#34;; a humiliating scene in which Fran Ryan propositions Griffith, offering &#34;some home grown&#34;; and an insulting subplot in which a woman, pursued by a deputy played as a drippy buffoon, seems to &#34;sleep around&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Alda&#39;s film has a grim, bleached-out, colorless, lifeless look and feel. Only Louise Lasser adds spark. At least the other films had some spirit, scenery, and pleasant music; Griffith&#39;s got out onto the mountainside, onto the lake, and even out into the big city. You feel more like re-watching Masters or Empty Grave than Shocking.

Chokher Bali  A passion play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on Rabindranath Tagore&#39;s novel of the same name, this is a classic tale of deception, adultery and relationship exploitation. Set in 1900 Bengal, director Rituparno Ghosh transformed the Nobel Laureates&#39; acclaimed literature into a delightful visual treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tagore&#39;s story elaborately deals with the Bengali society, through his central character, the rebellious widow, who wants to live a life of her own. We are taken into the picturesque part of Bengal, where we meet our heroine, the beautiful, young widow Binodini (Aishwarya Rai).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite her gorgeous looks, two handsome men, the rich Mahindra (Prosenjit Chatterji) and his friend Behari (Toto Roychowdhury), denied marrying her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mahindra chooses a naive Ashalata (Raima Sen) over Binodini and marries her. Leaving behind the country life, the free-spirited Binodini accompanies Mahindra&#39;s mother to Calcutta as a caretaker. Soon, her friendship with Ashalata flourishes. It looks like, the two, addressing each other as &#39;Chokher Bali&#39; (sand in the eyes), share an enduring bond. The English-speaking Binodini captures a special place in the house. But, soon, she unmasks her real face. Manipulating good-natured Ashlata, Binodini gets closer with Mahindra and fulfills her sexual desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When, she is thrown out by the enraged mother of Mahindra, Binodini seeks solace from a reluctant Behari. The remaining part of the story shows how the lives of these four characters crisscross and culminate in an unimaginable climax Aishwarya walks through the rolea manipulative, rebellious lady, still gaining the viewer&#39;s sympathywith a ballet dancer&#39;s elegance. The other lead artistesProsenjit Chatterjee, Raima Sen and Toto Roychowdhuryare equally brilliant, in enacting their characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Tagore penned this &#39;mould-breaking&#39; story at the turn of the 20th century, the very idea of widow marriage was a taboo, even among the upper class! Narrating the nations&#39; freedom movement in parallel, the author asserts the importance of individual freedom from the caged life. Kudos to the art director, who gave life to the early 20th century Bengal, and applause to the cinematographer for capturing those sets with verve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &#39;passion play,&#39; by Tagore, has been fervently converted to the screen by the ablest filmmaker without loosing its originality.

I know Terry Gilliam is considered as a good director but claiming that this movie is good is just foolish. What was the movie about? What is it a spoof? Fantasy? Comedy? Satire? No answer there from Gilliam&#39;s screenplay. Totally confused and pointlessly hurtling from one historical age to another. I find it amusing that some people actually call this movie magical. Is it because they have to praise any movie which is vague and indecisive on what it is about?? 3 stars for special effects considering it is 1981. Roger Ebert has it right in his review. The movie is ambiguous and looks like Gilliam&#39;s romp with money just to make a vague children&#39;s move masquerading as a historical revue. The movie also tries to confuse the would-be viewer by giving John Cleese and Sean Connery top billing.

OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original &#34;D.O.A.&#34; is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after &#34;The Right Stuff&#34; made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is more of an &#34;update&#34; of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different. The plot is pretty much the same. A man (this time an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin) is poisoned and he has only 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him. Jane Kaczmarek plays Quaid&#39;s estranged wife, in a low key, but intense performance; she steals every scene she is in. Daniel Stern (also in an early role, before &#34;Home Alone&#34; made him famous) plays Quaid&#39;s colleague. Charlotte Rampling is fine too in a supporting role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire cast is top notch; The film is stylish, with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller, and as a modern version of a classic film.

My cable TV has what&#39;s called the Arts channel, which is a &#34;catch-as-catch-can&#34; situation sometimes, sometimes films, sometimes short clips of films or ballets, and I came into this just as the bar scene came on, where they tear up their coupons. Excellent, exquisite, Ealing wins again, my wartime-Glasgow-raised mother would love this, should I ever find a copy of it. Some of Britain&#39;s best artists, from Mr Holloway to Wayne and Radford and the delicious Miss Rutherford, having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the Home Office. Loved the last scene, where as soon as they are &#34;back in England!&#34; the temperature plummets and it rains...

I caught this on late, late Mexican cable and I have to rant about it. The title was translated as &#34;Secretos&#34; (Secrets). Well there&#39;s a secret that has an important part in the movie but come on, ! We are not stupid. We know there&#39;s a novel behind this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the movie is pretty interesting and it&#39;s carried by it&#39;s solid ramatic performances. The always beautiful and stunning Jordana Brewster and Christopher Eccleston deliver great performances and have such great chemistry between them. Cameron Dìaz is also good although she has minimal on-screen time. Blythe Danner is perfect and his last appearance in the movie is touching, sad. Great performances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jordana&#39;s character and her sister&#39;s ex-boyfriend travel to Europe in order for her to deal with his demons and understand why her sister died. Through flashbacks, we learn the sad truth and we can&#39;t help but feel sorry for the whole family. The ending is truly moving. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there&#39;s nudity but it&#39;s minimal. In fact, the sex scenes are artsy and do not intend to be steamy or sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I kept watching it for Joranda Brewster&#39;s on screen charming and beauty. And I ended up liking the story and the dramatic presentations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this movie a try if you like solid dramatic features. Great movie. The last, last scene was very sad.. The two little sisters through flashbacks.

This film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film! The plot is somewhat lacking, but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference. This is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please. As a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining; and with major stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas... how could you go wrong? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued, and is very difficult to imitate. A good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this film: The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments. Achieving true comedic dialog is an art.

Drew Barrymore gets second chance at high school, on undercover assignment as newspaper reporter. In flashbacks, we see that the first time around was, to put it mildly, a major disaster. David Arquette is amusing in modest role as Drew&#39;s brother, who also enrolls to help out sis. Lots of subplots endanger but never overwhelm simple charm of movie. Drew keeps making her niche as major innocent-sexy light comic actress.

Loving the Andersen fairy tails as a child and recently having seen some intriguing documentaries on this odd, though brilliant, author, I eagerly looked forward to see this made-for-TV film. Unfortunately the experience was nothing but a disappointment leaving me in anger and confusion. First of all the story/script is filled with inaccuracies and downright fantasies and in this way creating almost a completely new story while shamefully abusing Andersen&#39;s fairy tales, presumably in order to sell the crap to suckers like me. Secondly, pretty-boy actor (really... ever seen a picture of the real Andersen?) Kieran Brew manages to portray Hans Christian as mentally retarded rather than the brilliant though very disturbed character he indeed was. Though annoying and irritating like Andersen, Brew is missing the required charisma to create any feelings of compassion what so ever. Thirdly. The love story between Andersen and the fictional Jetta (whom actually should be Henriette, the wife of Edvard Collin)... Why? This man has lived such an interesting life, it should be enough as a foundation to a great movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could continue this to be a very long list but feel it safest to simply recommend all of you to spend your time and money on something else instead.

I&#39;m not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it&#39;s absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part. The town is creepy and I&#39;m just gonna stop there. Because thats when the truly gruesome mayhem begins. trust me when I say if your looking for a horror film go see this you will love it. It&#39;s wonderfully diabolical and inventive with it&#39;s killing scenes, the story is interesting and the characters are decently drawn with the actors giving them gobs of personality. Paris Hilton included whom does quite well with her part. the film lies a little on the shallow side but it&#39;s so much fun and who cares. This movie should eat up the box office and all horror fans should have part in it. Go see House of Wax the film that features skin being peeled, super glued lips, dead animal carcasses, hot wax sprayed on a still living person, a finger being cut off, a decapitation, a pole through the head and much more. I was lucky enough to witness this film at the Tribeca premiere and all the actors were on hand to promote the film. And boy do they have something to be proud of House of wax is the scariest roller coater ride of the year! 9/10

Somewhere inside this movie is a half-hour episode from The Twilight Zone trying to get out. Whereas Cube was taut, well-made, claustrophobic and mind-engaging, I&#39;m afraid Cypher is a bloated, tedious rehash of several well-worn themes which just don&#39;t add up to much, especially if you have seen almost any other half-way decent sci-fi film before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending. None of the characters spark off each other, and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy. It is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of Cube. It&#39;s not a bad movie, but it is most definitely not a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#39;ve watched the grass grow and paint dry and are bored of your stick insects then by all means watch this film, but the other activities will probably prove more stimulating.

Overlong drama that isn&#39;t capable of making any real point. So she became an actress - so what? She learned to love - big deal. There is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations, but the kind which is bad for the movie, causing it to often seem absurd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer Phoenix, playing the lead, talks and behaves like a semi-retarded person, so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater - which was clearly not the intended point. We are told early on (in that &#34;Barry Lyndon&#34;-like narration) that she learned to hide her emotions, which certainly explains her autistic stone-face, but the movie suffers for it. She basically walks around like a zombie, and her success as an actress isn&#39;t quite credible given her lack of emotions. Occasionally, the movie had that dull, sleepy feel of a Dogma 95 movie. Is it one? I wouldn&#39;t be at all surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer Phoenix is sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the late River Phoenix. Nepotism rarely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;d like to see my Hollywood Nepotism List, with over 350 pictures/entries, contact me by e-mail.

This is an extraordinary film musically. It made me feel awful that Rodrigues died in 1999, before I had a chance to see her live. To know that she performed a marvelous Lincoln Ctr. concert in 1991 &amp; that I might&#39;ve been there, but wasn&#39;t is painful beyond words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased my first Amalia recording. While the musical recording is fantastic, being able, in this film to SEE her face &amp; its tremendous expressiveness &amp; passion as she sings these songs of terrible sadness is wonderful. Sort of like seeing the face of Mary as she cradles Jesus in her arms in the Pieta. Watching her on film, reminded me of being witness to a similar extraordinary concert performance by Mercedes Sosa in the mid 1990s at Lincoln Ctr. As I sat listening to Mercedes sing, I felt I was in the presence of a tremendous spiritual &amp; musical force that contained awesome primal power. Some of &#34;The Art of Amalia&#34;&#39;s musical segments are touching, such as Caetano Veloso paying tribute to Amalia &amp; singing one of her songs solo in front of a packed concert hall. The musical segments also convey the incredible international sweep of her musical repertoire &amp; the bonds she created w. fans throughout the entire world. There is one segment in which she claims that she has played in every single town in Italy that has a stage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In another section, Amalia talks about her bout w. mouth cancer &amp; how she came to NYC to commit suicide in a hotel. Yet, through watching Fred Astaire film videos she gradually persuaded herself that life was worth living &amp; turned away from killing herself. Amazing! Later in the film, she quite bravely &amp; directly admits to the interviewer that though she might&#39;ve conquered the world musically, her personal life was one of pure sadness. She admits that she has never been happy. This is unbearably sad to hear, but perfectly in keeping w. a singer steeped in the fado (which she translates as &#34;bad destiny&#34; or &#34;bad luck&#34;) tradition. Also, one longs to hear more about her personal life: what was in that made her so sad? what were her disappointments?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Art of Amalia&#34; is a little disappointing in other major areas. My quibbles: to show 20-30 full songs in the film yet to only provide an English translation for the very last one seems a waste (unless the film was only intended for a Portuguese speaking audience, which I can&#39;t imagine). To see the profound pain on her face as she sings &amp; not to understand the lyrics is a let down. As for the other minuses: there is almost no biographical material about Amalia&#39;s family background. There is one 20 sec. snippet w. her singing w. her mother (it&#39;s absolutely grand). There is one short reference to her parents moving fr. the countryside to Lisbon. I would&#39;ve loved to see film footage of the village she came from. The interviews such as they are are almost solely w. Amalia herself (&amp; a few close friends). She is a good, but not great subject. There are no interview subjects who are experts on fado or Portuguese culture &amp; society, so we get no depth of understanding of her musical roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this is a wonderful film that everyone interested in Amalia should see. But it&#39;s not a perfect or definitive work on the subject.

I didn&#39;t have much faith at the beginning, but as a Costa Rica&#39;s citizen I can confirm that the movie shows the reality that we live day by day, and shows a lot of things of our culture, such as our way to speak, our music, our way of standing up for our rights without any fear, without any weapons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m really proud of the job they did and of how they didn&#39;t forget along the movie the message they wanted us to receive, not caring for the money, but actually working with a short budget, letting us appreciate the beautiful scenarios and the great photography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend seeing this movie, you will not regret it.

This film was basically Velvet Goldmine if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a t.v. movie. The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine had which was good acting, writing, and basically everything else. The film had some of the worst writing I&#39;ve seen since Wild Wild West. It definitely needed to be interesting. I know vh 1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows. which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a behind the music episode but didn&#39;t and feel flat on it&#39;s face.

To put it simply, I am not fond of westerns. And having never sat through one from beginning to end, I decided to watch &#34;My Darling Clementine&#34; and see it all the way through, no matter how painful it was for me. At first it was excruciating as expected. I found the acting to be laughable, the scenery (your standard dessert, horses and cowboys) boring and the music and its timing teetering on the edge of painful. However, after mentally pep talking myself to struggle on, after the first 20 minutes it began to be quite a bit easier for me to endure. Focusing in on the cinematography, and how John Ford managed to make even the dullest situations (dull according to me that is) look quite stunning at times, made it a lot more interesting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I can&#39;t go so far as to say that I enjoyed the movie by the end of it. However it was made well enough for me to sit all the way through to the very end, and that in itself impresses me.

This &#34;Debuted&#34; today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is &#34;I am speechless&#34; I taped it today so I could watch it tonight after work. I had high hopes, Now I am tearing apart the closets looking for a length of rope so I can hang myself. Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I wish I could say something nice like &#34;It was fun to make fun of this movie&#34; but this movie is giving me nothing to work with. I know you are not supposed to post spoilers here with out prior warning but I am going to anyway &#34;This movie sucks&#34; There I said it! They should show this flick to film students to show them what NOT to do! My nine year old niece could make a better film. The only decent thing about this film is the sound and/or sound track. OH! I just found a rusty C-clamp in my old tool box. I am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen. I could just tape over this VHS but I think I will burn it in the fire pit instead. I could wash with soap but I fear I will never be clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to people you hate. -Mike

Just had to write that one liner, but it really is. I love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry I&#39;ve seen in recent years . I have praises for everyone involved in most aspects except the most important one, the script . It is a weak story about a petty criminal. No amount of fine acting or black and white film styling can make up for a total lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear he&#39;s gonna do another film about the general. My advice is don&#39;t waste your time.

My God. This movie was awful. I can&#39;t complain about it too much. I went to see it just to be grossed out. It did suffice, sort of. It&#39;s funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was in the very, very beginning where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think that it&#39;s funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the Hispanic soldier, who was a supporting actor in Next Friday. Everyone in the movie did a horrible acting job. It was some of the worst acting I&#39;ve ever paid to see. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also expected that it would be much more gruesome than the first one. It wasn&#39;t. I expected it to be more gruesome because it&#39;s a sequel and horror movie sequels are usually much less successful than their predecessors. I expected it to be more gruesome since gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 &amp; 2, Dead Silence), but It actually wasn&#39;t nearly as gruesome as the first one, which was yet another disappointment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mutants in the first one were kind of disturbing but the filmmakers were trying so hard in this one to make them creepy that they were absolutely hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also hated the entire concept of showing the clip of the female soldier&#39;s son on her camera-phone saying &#34;I love you, mommy&#34; FOUR TIMES. It was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel even WORSE for her by showing it three more times for no reason. This movie was a joke.

This is only the second time I stopped a video/DVD part way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first, even though it managed to be both shallow, clichéd and stupid.. AND joyless, plodding and pretentious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was like an After School Special directed by that weird grade nine kid who thinks nobody understands him... creepy and sad, with voice-over narration that only the most deluded adolescent would consider poetry... and some singing, and... no, really, the poor child&#39;s suffering...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough, already, especially when it morphed into a brazen, clumsy, and insulting Clockwork Orange ripoff. And did I mention the singing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#39;t the worst film I&#39;ve ever seen, but certainly the one I&#39;ve felt least compelled to sit through. I don&#39;t recommend it to anyone.

I don&#39;t know why, but i thought i&#39;ve seen this movie before. Maybe it was the name, maybe it was the way poster looked, i don&#39;t know. Anyway, it was quite promising in the beginning. And even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments. Maybe its because i&#39;m not a huge fan of the horrors, and i don&#39;t watch them a lot, but this one actually looked fresh sometimes. But the rest of it is not so good. Laughable at times. The movie is slow paced, sometimes you will get so bored you&#39;d forget what was the story about. Characters are not great either. All of them. The butcher is OK, seems creepy and crazy enough. Although i didn&#39;t get what were those weird looking things on his chest (that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out-of-the-blue), and why he was collecting those in jars at home? The main lead is plain. His character is really hard to believe in, and very undeveloped. But i guess thats scenarists fault. Like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend? Side cast is bad too. But the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl. My god, when will women in horror movies have any brains? Its ridiculous. The girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera, tries going to police, that fails, and then she thinks of the best idea ever. Why don&#39;t we just go and take it! I know where the maniac lives! Yup! Thats swell! And then look for the camera in the bathroom! Why not? And then walk in the room, see a bag that was not there before, and just have a look inside. Maybe camera is there? Not there. But loads of interesting stuff. Shiny. Mmmm. To realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain. Then of course the never ending &#34;falling while running away&#34; trick, that really made it look bad. Then, to put the final nail into the character, in the end of the movie, she walks into the wagon FULL with dead bodies hanging feet up, screams &#34;Noooo&#34; like she just ripped her Gucci bag, and walks further into the wagon... Jeez. Come on. No one else thinks its just, well, stupid? Just awful. If her character wasn&#39;t so bad, maybe the movie would get another star or two from me. And i would even forgive MMT characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer (that dude in the train who the conductor killed), butcher vests that can protect from bullets, weird and cheap looking monsters in the end (i didn&#39;t read Clive Barkers novel, so i have no idea where those monsters came from), the fact that no one cared that hundreds (judging on the skeletons in the dungeon) disappeared in the city, and main character that didn&#39;t bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out (he barely noticed it i guess). Oh, and the predictable ending. Damn, i knew the ending half way in, its just disappointing. The only reason i&#39;m still giving some credit to the makers, is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i&#39;ve watched past few months. Visual style is nice, some shots were really nice and good CGI that made the killings look really brutal. (although blood didn&#39;t look real at all) I guess some people will enjoy it, some, like me, will watch it if there is nothing else to watch, some will absolutely hate it.

To put it simply, Mind of Mencia is the worst, unfunniest show on Comedy Central, and quite possibly all of television... ever. I love Comedy Central and watch many shows and movies there all the time, but every time the intro for this show even starts after some good comedy, I can&#39;t find the remote fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mencia tells used, worn out racial jokes in a bad attempt at being controversial, then will point out the ethnicity he just talked about in the audience as if to say &#39;they liked it, so all of your race likes it, and by extension me too&#39;. Give me a break Mencia, I don&#39;t know if those people are plants or not, but just because you go to a black guy and high five him after one of your ridiculous jokes, doesn&#39;t mean he thinks you&#39;re funny, it just means you put him on the spot and what else is he going to do, smack you on TV? He gives the impression that his jokes are deep, meaningful, and thought provoking, which is apparent in his commercials, but when you actually watch the show almost 100% of what he says is common sense. He also claims that only smart people get some of his jokes, but you don&#39;t have to be any smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says that, maybe you need to go finish 3rd grade Carlos. The guy goes on to say that he says what others are only thinking, but I think you&#39;ll find that if anyone was thinking what he says, they figured out all on their own that it was ridiculous, and that&#39;s why they never said it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, watch 1 episode and be done with it if you must, because after you&#39;ve seen 1 episode, you&#39;ve seen them all. Why Comedy Central keeps renewing this horrible show is well beyond me. If you&#39;re looking for good comedy, look elsewhere, because you will find very little of it here.

Two teenagers in the north-east of England are desperate to raise money and buy season tickets for their favourite football team. They go through a series of &#34;comic misadventures&#34; but come up smiling in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trailer for this film sells it as a comedy and includes most of its light-hearted moments. However, the tone is increasingly grim and the end result is a depressing story peopled with familiar stereotypes. The two &#34;heroes&#34; have no problems with lying, cheating and stealing. Their adversaries are a callous teacher, a pantomime villain of a father, a psychotic skinhead and a well-meaning but incompetent social worker. The other female characters are a drug addicted teenager, a pregnant schoolgirl and a battered wife who seems to be smoking herself to death. There are no likable characters, and the audience can only feel either pity or contempt. Local actors Tim Healy and Kevin Whateley both play against type as baddies, but the writing and direction of their characters are so one-dimensional that they have no more than novelty value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Beattie and Greg McLane give good performances in the two young leads. However, they are miscast, because they have the wrong accent. To anyone from the north east, it is obvious that they both come from the Sunderland/Durham area, and yet we are expected to believe they are natives of Newcastle. As a Geordie myself I can assure you that the accents are by no means the same. Take the phrase &#34;Let the poor lad speak&#34;. We say &#34;Let the pooa lad speek&#34; while they say &#34;piwer lad spiyk&#34;, with two distinctly different vowel sounds. This discrepancy creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene in Sunderland football ground, where the two lads are trying to disguise the Newcastle accents they don&#39;t have, and *pretend* that they come from Sunderland - which they clearly do. In a gentle comedy this kind of criticism might be seen as nit-picking. However, the film&#39;s bleak tone makes it clear that writer/director Mark Herman is aiming for gritty realism: that means &#34;near enough&#34; is actually way off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped for humour and optimism from this film, and instead found tired old clichés. Tyneside is not a grey wasteland populated solely by losers, and in telling us it is, Herman should have known he would cause offence. It&#39;s interesting to compare the film with the same director&#39;s &#34;Little Voice&#34; - also largely downbeat and populated by one-dimensional characters, &#34;Little Voice&#34; at least has a talented heroine and doesn&#39;t wallow in misery to the same extent. I&#39;ve heard &#34;Belter&#34; ranked alongside this year&#39;s &#34;Billy Elliot&#34;, but that film is a vastly more enjoyable and life-affirming experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, I may be just too old, but having lived on Tyneside for 42 years, I have never heard anyone outside this film use the expression &#34;Purely Belter&#34;.

In what I can say was a theft of my time I was taken to see this movie and I must say what a horrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie. Larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer. The plot is thin to say the least, the Cantonese dialog is not funny. See this movie at your peril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Tang from Shanghai Tang should be after the movie for the little or no revenue this movie will generate. The banal plot attempts to compete with other rom-coms out there, and just blends into the scenery. It was like watching paint dry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short this movie was a total waste of time and space. I&#39;ve seen better movies on youtube.

Sci-Fi channel thinks this IS Sci-Fi; it&#39;s a shame. Big Bugs, Snakes, Mythical Beasties, on and on, they persist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some one at Universal had the brains to include BattleStar Galactica (the new, good one) and Firefly for a brief moment in their line up. I know they know they difference between total garbage and extremely high quality sci-fi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years back they were on about how they were going all high and mighty, making productions that were not just for us mere, lame-o Trekkies. Thanks so much, Sci-Fi! You know, you make movies so bad, even Trekkies won&#39;t watch them, so you achieved your goal! Fire Serpent, Ice Spiders, Manticore, Larva etc.and a vast unrelenting crap-storm later, and they&#39;re still churning out just faster than the latest flu virus! How they do it is beyond my ken. Why they do it, I just don&#39;t know. How they can ignore these reviews, comments, blogs and e-mails, I don&#39;t know either, but it&#39;s clear they don&#39;t think much of their audience or care about our opinions! They seem to think this is what sci-fi fans want! You would think one or two good productions with some sense would creep through when whoever green lights this junk is on vacation. At least they&#39;re employing the collection of Misfit Toys; many of the sci-fi movie of the week actors were in Science Fiction shows once and now need the cash. Love you folks, and hope you get some better work!

An interesting idea for a film, both showing the last dragon on earth and showing the struggle he and someone evil have together. When he was younger, Einon got stabbed in the heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the dark lord who gave him half his heart. Now grown up Einon (David Thewlis) is now the selfish and evil king. Meanwhile, Bowen is using a new friend Draco the Dragon (voiced by Sir Sean Connery) to get rewards for &#34;killing&#34; dragons. But because Einon has half of Draco&#39;s hear, they both feel the pain in one of them is hurt, or killed. Also starring Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Worth watching!

I gotta admit it, I love horror films...especially 80s slasher films. Hell, I even love cheese like Sleepaway Camp and Night of the Demons. But, I didn&#39;t think much of this movie. The death scenes weren&#39;t very well done, the CGI was terrible, and the acting was ho-hum. Worst of all was the story which didn&#39;t make sense at all. I&#39;d say save your money but chances are, if you want to see this movie...you&#39;re going to anyway. I didn&#39;t hate it...it&#39;s just not very good. Overall, it&#39;s just another bland, lifeless horror film that lacks life (it&#39;s no surprise that this one was on the shelf at Dimension for over a year after it was completed).

You can often tell a movie didn&#39;t turn out like it should by the heavy use of a narrator. This film features this device throughout. Richard Jobson not entirely content to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to gloss over what is a dull depressing tale which he must be mistaking for genuine art-house. Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance. Everyone else is okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. Bless.

Making this short and to the point. This movie was great! I loved it! I actually picked this up at a Hollywood Video for 3 bucks on VHS and watched it about 5 times in the last couple weeks. I&#39;m a big Bogart fan and I just latched onto this movie. I thought the song was funny and now have it as a ring tone on my phone. Robert Sacchi is great and pulls off a good Bogart. His nose is a little big, his voice is a Bogart-Columbo mix, and he does a few things that are awkward but otherwise, he was fantastic and this film was wonderful. No one can be a perfect Bogart but he was great. Remember, Sam Marlow is a fan of Bogart and isn&#39;t going to do everything he did. He mentions a lot of other movies and does some things that were never part of the real Bogart&#39;s character&#39;s. But, it&#39;s so funny and hilarious and has a great cast, including some beautiful women. Watch it and have fun!

Ladies and gentlemen, allow us to introduce to you . The Toltecs! This ancient Latin American tribe, even preceding the Aztecs, supposedly had the most malevolent and bloodthirsty sorcerers, yet they get their asses whooped by a couple of college floozies and a one-hundred-and-seven-year old lawman with a whip! But before you get to see this, however, you have to struggle through more than 40 minutes of sheer boredom, infantile pranks and sleazy sequences that don&#39;t contain any actual sleaze. In case I haven&#39;t made myself entirely clear yet: &#34;The Dark Power&#34; is an indescribably cheesy and inept piece of 80&#39;s horror crap that still manages to be amusing because of its sheer and somewhat charming stupidity factor. Writer/director Phil Smoot&#39;s intentions were obviously admirable, but he  as well as the rest of the cast &amp; crew  lacked the talent and financial means to deliver something even half-decent. Smoot carefully watched &#34;The Evil Dead&#34; and other similar demonic-themed movies, and somehow must have thought he could pull this off as well. The movie opens with an old Indian guy dying in his isolated countryside house; barely speaking out his last word above a whisper  Toltecs. His grandson promptly rents out house to a bunch of college chicks, including a typically 80&#39;s aerobics babe, a cute black girl and a racist redneck gal. Soon they will discover why exactly the old Indian lived like a hermit, as he was actually the guardian of an ancient Toltec burial ground. Toltec sorcerers buried themselves alive, only to emerge again thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living. And, honestly, is there any better tasting flesh than that of bimbos? As hinted at before already, the first half of &#34;The Dark Power&#34; is terribly lame and sleep-inducing. The clichéd pranks, the retarded dialogs and the ridiculously overlong footage of Lash LaRue swinging around his whip seem to go on forever. Then, the movie loses its last smidgen of credibility when the Toltec sorcerers emerge from the ground. Instead of menacing, they look like drugged out hard rock stars with imbecile masks and drunken gestures. Exactly ONE gory moment is worth mentioning, when a guy&#39;s lips are stretched out over his entire skull, but overall even the carnage aspect of this movie is disappointing. The only remotely worthwhile moments are utterly senseless, like when a 9-year-old kid (named Cletus!) goes joyriding with his uncle&#39;s truck or when the vulgar naked chick sips beer in the bathtub after working out. Seriously, unless you get turned on by the sight of a 1940&#39;s western veteran swinging around his whip at nothing, I&#39;d advise to skip this film.

Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, over three years ago. I went in with no expectations since Christopher Nolan was a no-name at the time, but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at that festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood. Mr.Nolan gave a good account of its making at the end, enough to put anybody off starting out as a film-maker! I liked it better than Memento although this was, perhaps, due to the lower expectations. And the fact that it was more of an art house movie.

Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, &#34;Scarface&#34; is a movie that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American Dream. Montana then becomes the &#34;king&#34; in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crime in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This movie has around 180+ F-words and is almost three hours long. This movie is entertaining and you will never get bored. You cheer for the Drug-lord, and in some scenes you find out that Montana isn&#39;t as evil as some other Crime Lords. This is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this. You will not be disappointed. 9/10

I&#39;m no slouch at finding &#34;redeeming social value.&#34; Whatever book or film people want to suppress, from Huck Finn/Heart of Darkness to, I don&#39;t know, Deep Throat or the latest hostage beheading, I sincerely wish they wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;m not a lover of porn or of violence-as-entertainment, but what of them I chance upon I tend to see camera angles, cuts, pans, lighting, rhythms, nearly to the exclusion of fear or titillation, sometimes even missing filmmakers&#39; or actors&#39; intent. Even from footage that reasonable people may argue should never have existed, I always imagine there&#39;s something to learn. I wonder more at how a film does than about what it does. Maybe that&#39;s wrong of me. Wiser but harder than deconstructing unpleasant cinema, might be to see cuts, pans, etc., at one with and inseparable from no matter what content. I ask myself what horror filmmakers and church architects have in common. Add in political filmmakers, fascist and not. All manipulate with light, space, and sound in order to alter perception and mood. How different are their goals? How different are the goals of those who film real atrocities for use as propaganda? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the original All Night Long (ANL) trilogy appeared on my shelf, I left it unwatched for nearly year. Curiosity had made me buy it. I sampled a few minutes of &#34;1&#34; the day it arrived, up to the awkwardly sound-effected street corner stabbing that seems really an attack on film viewers&#39; sensibility, found it inept but effective. I&#39;d have to come back to it, certainly, but didn&#39;t relish the prospect. Clearly this wasn&#39;t the sublime horror of Kairo, Cure, Angel Dust, Lain, the rawer but still traditionally framed horror of the first Evil Dead Trap, the overtly political work of Koji Wakamatsu, or even the brilliant crudity of early Cronenberg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that word &#34;attack&#34; is key. Matsumura attacks not his characters, but his viewers. I can&#39;t watch these at this point in history without thinking of both Abu Garib (some of which I think I recall was evidenced on video) and the hostage videos, but also about Godard&#39;s torturers (in Le Petit soldat?) to whom atrocity is just a job, a fraction of a person&#39;s workday. And then there&#39;s the prolonged Northern California news story whose details I barely remember but can&#39;t entirely forget because it too entails &#34;cinema,&#34; a duo of serial killers notorious, if suggestion isn&#39;t playing games with my memory, for having videotaped themselves torturing victims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three ANL entries are revenge cinema, vigilante exercises, but I&#39;m attaching these notes ANL3 because it&#39;s the most ambitious and may constitute a turning point for director Matsumura. (I haven&#39;t seen the entries that followed ANL3.) Through the first two offerings, I imagined a camera fallen into the hands of one of those fringe kids from middle or grammar school who obsessively draw war scenes or other atrocities. (Or as if one of Matsumura&#39;s revenge-crazed characters had turned writer-director. Anyone watching these who hasn&#39;t seen Michael Powell&#39;s Peeping Tom would do well to see it.) But ANL3 seems to aspire to mainstream. Matsumura&#39;s protagonist grows carnivorous plants, allowing for some typically Japanese cool close-up nature shots. There&#39;s also, for the first time a Matsumura film, a traditionally erotic sequence: Kikuo&#39;s female boss sneaks up and begins to caress him while he&#39;s peeping at the love hotel&#39;s customers. Kikou finds himself unhappily sandwiched between. He&#39;s a middleman voyeur. The brief thrill comes from the layers of voyeurism. There&#39;s even a philosophical/poetic garbage sifter, a garbage voyeur who somehow makes me think of the poem repeated in Wakamatsu&#39;s not-at-all-what-it-sounds-like Go, Go, Secondtime Virgin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m getting nowhere with this, and it&#39;s getting in the way of my commenting other films. Can&#39;t escape the suspicion that a few years on I&#39;ll walk into a Matsumura retrospective at my local film archive, maybe hosted by some learned character who&#39;s caught onto something I&#39;m missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much does it matter whether the director is or simply &#34;gets&#34; his lethally muddled protagonists? Does he even have to understand them? Maybe a director&#39;s job is just to spew it out, then let critics, sociologists, and the rest of us hash things out. Maybe directorial or artistic responsibility is a bogus notion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final struggle with this thing had me wondering what on earth a woman thinks watching these overwhelmingly male exercises. We put women through this over and over, from Star Wars to et cetera and et cetera and on and on and on and on, but is anything quite as male-skewed as the All Night Longs?

This movie is banned in just about every foreign country I can think of. The Japanese people (?) who star in this must have been really desperate for a job, or we&#39;re just friends. Here&#39;s the scoop:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three thugs torture the hell out of a helpless woman, they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her, they burn her, kick her, spin here around in a chair (over 200 times!), they use sound torture (by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over 20 hours! It don&#39;t sound that bad at all, but it CAN make you go nuts). They throw guts (probably from an animal) at her while shes knocked out, and she freaks when she wakes up. And who can forget the grande finale the GREATEST EYEBALL TORTURE I HAVE EVER SEEN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not heard of these films, and watch one without knowing that it is a simulated snuff film, you will think it is! (just ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick! Like I said pure underground. Check it out if you are a fan of underground horror, or foreign gore. If your not I highly recommend you read-up on the series before watching! From the gore, shock, and creativity aspect it gets a 10, but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a 1. An underground classic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final rating is a 8/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that aren&#39;t stories, but the way he tried to show time passing by (the couple of joggers, who first appear jogging together, than jogging with a stroller (sic!), than the man alone...) and to link the &#34;adventures&#34; of the characters (the final scene, with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another cliff, and then seeing the boat with her former employer and saying &#34;Oh, a boat!&#34;) were awful. At the same time, I liked the way he portrayed the middle-high class, even in an excessive way. I think it is a lousy movie. If you want to watch it, do it as a film school student, trying to see technical aspects and issues. It will help a lot.

I hope the people who made this movies read these comments. The choreography was horrid, the plot was nill, and the actors where so low budget power rangers appears 5 star to this junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fight scenes where so slow you could actually see the actors waiting for each other to perform the next move. Camera cut-aways and poor lighting could not cover up the cheap effects. The lightning was just plain stupid. The weapons looked like something out of a final fantasy game, and the dual bow and arrow was just dull as anything I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next movie you decide to make try investing in some wireless mics, better script and try actually spending some time on your stunts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly there are shows on t.v. that play ever night and are thrown together in a few hours that look better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick to martial arts (unless its as poor as your acting) then take up quilting.

Aside from the discotheque scenes that epitomize the swinging sixties (especially with everyone dancing to instrumental versions of Monkees hits), I am surprised how well this lightweight farce holds up 37 years later, but indeed it does thanks to the breezy execution of its deception-based plot and the sharp interplay of the three leads. Directed by the redoubtable stage-to-screen expert Gene Saks, this 1969 comedy is about Julian Winston, a successful Manhattan dentist and confirmed bachelor, who pretends to be married in order to avoid long-term commitment with his young girlfriend of a year, Toni. In response to Toni&#39;s half-hearted suicide attempt, Julian agrees to marry her, but Toni first insists on meeting his wife to alleviate her conscience. Enter Julian&#39;s devoted nurse Stephanie to play the wife, and the inevitable complications ensue with white lies growing into major whoppers that lead to presumed couplings and de-couplings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Julian, a relaxed Walter Matthau dexterously plays the deceptive dentist in his typically sardonic manner, but he lets his two female co-stars walk off with the picture. In her big screen debut, a pixyish 24-year old Goldie Hawn is still retaining her giggly &#34;Laugh-In&#34; persona but provides unexpected savvy and depth as Toni. She and Matthau have great, unforced chemistry in their scenes together. Screen legend Ingrid Bergman, still serenely regal at 54, is obviously having a ball playing Stephanie, initially starchy and quick-witted but blossoming into a liberated spirit as the story evolves. I particularly like how casual she appears after her overnight romp. There is nice supporting work from Rick Lenz as Toni&#39;s bohemian neighbor Igor and Jack Weston as Julian&#39;s smarmy actor buddy Harvey. Billy Wilder&#39;s longtime collaborator, I.A.L. Diamond, provides the sparkling screenplay and opens up the story beyond its stage-bound origins for Saks, who is not the most cinematic of directors. Other than a couple of trailers, there are no significant extras with the DVD.

Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen&#39;s life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70&#39;s. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen&#39;s talent. Also, Karen was beautiful but had a bad hairdresser. My choice for playing Karen is Hilary Swank. I would love to see a more substantive story, because there was more to Karen than meets the eyes when listening to We&#39;ve Only Just Begun. I have tons of unreleased Carpenters&#39; music, and it is absolutely excellent. (Her singing of California Dreamin is to die for).

Why did they unleash this movie upon us? It seems as though they set out to make this movie a total slap in theface to Anne Rice and every self respecting Vampire Chronicles fan. It ignores the ground work laid down by Interview with the Vampire,mutilates the plot of the novel and has Stuart Townsend stumbling around drunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuart is NOT our Lestat! Our brat prince, our adventurous rebel with the damndest sense of humor. Stuart IS a second rate, boring rip off of Dracula in black leather. He DID NOT read the books or know the character...is he illiterate? Tom Cruise is dyslexic and still he made a point to read the books and know and love Lestat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t kid yourselves, it is not a &#34;Stand Alone&#34; vampire flick it&#39;s trash plain and simple.

Oh, God! Why didn&#39;t you give this money for charity? I thought I saw the lowest crap by now, but I was wrong! Who did this script, anyway? A retarded? Who did this cast? I can&#39;t believe that there are people that spend money and time to do garbage like that! I was under the impression that I&#39;m watching a porn movie, only without sex scenes, that bad was the so called acting. Onestly, did this film have a director? I believe not and I&#39;m convince that everybody had upon them a page with some lines and red it in front of the camera. I can&#39;t explain myself how all the characters in this garbage died without a fight. Nobody can do lower than this! Please, erase it even from IMDb! Bleah!

&#39;Una Giornata Particolare&#39; is a movie that has a title that sounds so familiar I thought I had seen it more than once. Now that I finally I have seen it, I am very glad. This is one of the better Italian movies I know, with one of the most wonderful performances by Marcello Mastroianni, who stars in other masterpieces such as &#39;La Dolce Vita&#39; and &#39;8 1/2&#39;, both from the great Federico Fellini. Directed by Ettore Scola, this is a movie that takes the time to introduce the characters and slowly develops a story on a special day, the day Adolf Hitler visited Rome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcello Mastroianni plays Gabriele, the neighbor of Antonietta (Sophia Loren). She is a member of Mussolini&#39;s party, pretty fanatic in her thoughts, and he is a member no more. The reason for that I will not reveal. On the day every person from their building, including her husband and children, is out to see Hitler, they are still in the building. Antonietta&#39;s bird escapes and flies to Gabriele&#39;s apartment, and this is how the two meet. Right before Antonietta went to Gabriele he thought of killing himself, again for reasons I will not reveal. How the story develops from here I will not reveal, but it is what happens between the two that makes this such a special day, not the fact that Hitler is in Rome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, Mastroianni has a wonderful performance. You see he is a man who desperately wants someone around him, although at first we don&#39;t know why. May be he likes Antonietta, may be he is in love with her, may be there are other reasons. Antonietta feels what we feel. What does this man want from her? She likes the attention anyway. We see how she does her hair to look attractive for the man. Loren plays the scenes very good as well. We understand her questions, although we can&#39;t be sure what her intentions are. The moments where we find out both their secrets, if that is what you can call it, is a great moment. How the story develops from there is even more interesting, but I don&#39;t want to spoil it for you. This is a movie you should see. Great performances and a beautiful cinematography, and the message it gives us still stands today.

Imagine if you will: four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in St. Francisville, Louisiana to check for the existence of the paranormal. If you watch this in the dark and late at night; you possibly will have the hair on the back of your neck rise a couple of times. Otherwise this mock documentary is a very lazy rip off of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. What is to be dialogue is very lame and the actors are pleasant looking enough, but seem to lack genuine personality. It seems to take forever before something real spooky even happens. This movie is excellent for &#39;sleep overs&#39;, when you have both eyes barely open and everyone is yakin&#39; and snackin&#39;.

Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) travels to Tibet and is bitten by a yeti, which causes him to become a werewolf. He is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife and her lover, and is later revived by a female scientist, Dr. Ilona Ermann, who uses him in mind control experiments. Daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor&#39;s failed experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon hearing of Naschy&#39;s death from colleague Jon Kitley, I rummaged through my collection for a suitable film to watch. In my scramble, I found I own not one but three(!) copies of &#34;Fury of the Wolfman&#34;. The film is of questionable video quality, the sound is dubbed in a mediocre fashion, the cinematography is sort of slapstick style at times. And the American versions have two love scenes removed. Quite frankly, without a remastered, uncut copy, I wasn&#39;t really getting the proper movie in all its glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf Count Waldemar Daninsky. I suspect this is true, but you wouldn&#39;t know this from the film itself. The plot is confusing at times, and there&#39;s really no indication that this is a sequel. If you read the plot summaries on Wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box, you&#39;ll see that I&#39;m not alone in my confusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the film&#39;s shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through. While floating around for years, it was only released in 1973, due to problems involved in finding a distributor. And Naschy said in his autobiography that the director, Zabalza, was an incompetent alcoholic, and that he hated working with him. Those really aren&#39;t light accusations, and I have no idea what Zabalza had to say on his own behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chances are, sooner or later you&#39;ll come across a low-grade version of &#34;Fury of the Wolfman&#34;. It appears in a variety of three-packs and box sets, so you might accidentally acquire it and not even know. What really needs to happen is an American uncut version, with a decent sound and video mix, and the love scenes thrown back in. As far as I know, this does not exist. Let us honor Paul Naschy&#39;s legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves.

TYSON &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aspect ratio: 1.33:1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound format: Stereo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reverent - though scrupulously fair - account of the life and times of champion boxer Mike Tyson. Given his conviction on a rape charge, the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain, but paints a warts-and-all portrait of his rise to fame, the pressures of success, and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad. Constrained by time limits, the script gallops through a succession of relevant details, alighting briefly on significant events, culminating with Tyson&#39;s (temporary) downfall in 1995. Novices will be enlightened by the chronology, while boxing fans will be entertained by director Uli Edel&#39;s straight-arrow approach to the material. He portrays Tyson&#39;s life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success. In fact, the script reserves most of its venom for Tyson&#39;s ex-wife Robin Givens, characterising her as an ungrateful gold-digger who took advantage of his naivety. Production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb: Michael Jai White does a fair imitation of the title character; George C. Scott plays Tyson&#39;s mentor Cus D&#39;Amato through acres of gritted teeth; and Paul Winfield was surely born to play Don King!

Although the plot of this film is a bit far-fetched, it is worth seeing just for the performances of Michaels Caine and Gambon. The latter delivers a truly wonderful Dublin accent. Caine hams it up...which is exactly what the character he is playing should do. Entertaining and fun, this is a hour and a half of easy watching.

Husband-and-wife doctor team Carole and Niles Nelson are doing modestly well in their careers, but Niles has a gambling problem. His luck changes when he (unknowingly) saves the life of a gangster from Joe Gurney&#39;s mob and gets a big bonus from the gangleader himself. Loving his change of fortune (and snazzy new apartment), Niles continues to receive payoffs for patching up other injured members of the gang. Unfortunately, his shady deals come to light in a police raid, which hangs a shadow over his wife&#39;s career as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point the plot comes into focus, as Carole Nelson has to rescue her career before her license is suspended. This involves bringing the gang to justice more or less single- handedly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a hard-edged gangster picture, but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE. There is some tension, but the mood is kept light by Bogart&#39;s tongue-in-cheek performance of a stupid gangster who imagines himself as the &#34;Napoleon of Crime.&#34; His other gang members also function more as stooges than hoodlums. And there&#39;s some snappy dialog between Bogart and Francis, especially when she&#39;s treating his injuries at his hideout. Of course, as in all gangster flicks, there&#39;s a big shootout ending, but with a humorous twist. This is a good short film showing Bogart on his rise to stardom.

Jacqueline Susann wrote several novels all involving sex and melodrama and a few of them actually were made into films including this effort and they all have the distinction of being some of the worst films ever made. Story here is about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) and his rise to the top of television by being ruthless and calculating to everyone around him. He&#39;s a playboy of the worst sort using and then throwing away every woman he beds including the wife of the IBC network president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****SPOILER ALERT***** Greg Austin (Robert Ryan) is in charge of the television network IBC and when his younger wife Judith takes one look at Robin she wastes no time getting into bed with him. Greg falls ill and has to take some time off and this is where Robin steps in and starts trying to run the network but during all this a model named Amanda (Jodi Wexler) who is in love with him kills herself. When Greg returns to his job he tries to get rid of Robin by using the morals clause in his contract when rumors start flying about his relationship with Jerry Nelson (David Hemmings) who&#39;s a gay fashion photographer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was directed by Jack Haley Jr. who went on to be a very successful producer in both television and movies but this was only his second film as a director and the material he was forced to deal with seems way over his head! The script comes from Susann&#39;s novel and that would probably be why this resembles a cross between &#34;Alfie&#34; and &#34;The Valley of the Dolls&#34; and I think the reason why her books never could translate well onto film is because the filmmakers made the terrible mistake of taking her stories seriously instead of tongue in cheek. With that, the laughs that come from this are unintentional especially during that totally ridiculous fight towards the end of the film which starts when Cannon refuses to give back the slave bracelet to the gay characters! Hemmings was a very good actor but his role here is completely over the top and it has him wearing one of the worst beards in history and using the term &#34;chic&#34; in every other sentence. Law was not the original choice for the lead but another actor that was cast had a serious accident and Law stepped in and delivers one of the more wooden performances this side of Miles O&#39;Keeffe. The film&#39;s script suffers in two different areas in that it&#39;s both completely silly and horribly dull and it will test a viewers patience if they choose to watch this. One has to wonder what would be the outcome if a director decided to film one of Susann&#39;s novels and not take it seriously because the attempt here is ponderous and ridiculous.

Horror-genius Dario Argento is one of my personal favorite directors, and his films &#34;Suspiria&#34;, &#34;Phenomena&#34; and &#34;Profondo Rosso&#34; range high on my personal all-time favorite list. &#34;Opera&#34; of 1987 is yet another tantalizing and brilliant film that no Horror lover can afford to miss, and that will keep you on the edge of your chair from the beginning to the end. This stunning and ultra-violent Giallo could well be described as the master&#39;s nastiest film, which is quite something considering that Argento&#39;s films are not exactly known for the tameness of their violence. The violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes Opera a film censor&#39;s nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Warning! SPOILERS ahead! - &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when Betty (Christina Marsillach), a young opera singer, is becoming successful, a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath starts stalking her... The murders are truly brutal, and of particularly sadistic nature. The killer attaches needles to the tied up Betty&#39;s eyelids, so she has to keep them open and watch while he brutally murders people close to her in abhorrent ways. When done with the butchering, the killer releases Betty and leaves, just to come back for other friends of hers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual for Argento&#39;s films, the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized. &#34;Opera&#34; truly is a brutal film, and what a stylish and atmospheric film it is. This film is absolutely tantalizing and pure suspense from the beginning to the end. The performances are entirely very good, especially Christina Marsillach is brilliant in the lead. A stunning beauty and great actress alike, Marsillach fits perfectly in her role of the talented singer, whose fear and horrid experiences are slowly making her crazy. Other great performances include those of Ian Charleston as a Horror film director who is directing an Opera, and director Argento&#39;s real-life girlfriend Daria Nicolodi, who has a role in many of his movies. The camera work is excellent as in all Argento films and The huge Opera House is an excellent setting that contributes a lot both to the film&#39;s beauty and its permanently creepy atmosphere. The score, which is partly classical music and partly heavy metal is great too, even though I slightly missed Goblin&#39;s brilliant Progressive Rock Soundtracks that are such a distinguishing element of most other Argento movies. &#34;Opera&#34; truly is a terrifying and absolutely breathtaking Giallo experience. This is an absolute must-see for any Horror lover, and I highly recommend it to any other film-fan who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely tantalizing!

&#34;Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle&#34; is anchored by a brilliant performance by Timothy Spall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we can predict that his titular morose, up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past, how his emotions are unveiled is surprising. Spall&#39;s range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the Mike Leigh repertory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes, such as on &#34;The Simpsons,&#34; this central situation of a visit to Salisbury Cathedral in Rhidian Brook&#39;s script is well-contained and structured for dramatic purposes, and is almost formally divided into acts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re introduced to the urban British range of racially and religiously diverse kids (with their uniforms I couldn&#39;t tell if this is a &#34;private&#34; or &#34;public&#34; school), as they gather  the rapping black kids, the serious South Asians and Muslims, the white bullies and mean girls  but conveyed quite naturally and individually. The young actors, some of whom I recognized from British TV such as &#34;Shameless,&#34; were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures. Celia Imrie puts more warmth into the supervisor&#39;s role than the martinets she usually has to play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious. We think, like the teacher portrayed by Ben Miles of &#34;Coupling,&#34; that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance, but it&#39;s much more about faith in people as well as God, which is why the BBC showed it in England at Easter time and BBC America showed it in the U.S. over Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nathalie Press, who was also so good in &#34;Summer of Love,&#34; has a key role in Mr. Harvey&#39;s redemption that could have been played for movie-of-the-week preaching, but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way (unfortunately I saw their intense scene interrupted by commercials).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is a bit heavy-handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip &#34;a pilgrimage,&#34; this quiet film was the best evocation of &#34;good will towards men&#34; than I&#39;ve seen in most holiday-themed TV movies.

I first saw this movie in the mid 80&#39;s and thought it was a funny movie. As I have gotten older I watch this movie for different reasons. I like to view it when I&#39;m feeling sad/nostalgic for my &#34;lost youth&#34;. I was a teenager (14) at the time of the release of this film so I can identify with many of the same problems/dilemmas that the campers/CIT&#39;s in this movie have. I enjoy seeing the clothes that were worn at this time and hearing the same old urban legends such as was told on the overnight canoe trip. The film is also full of funny one liners. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that was a teenager in the late 70&#39;s to early 80&#39;s.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is bored with brother #1, and jumps in the bed of brother #2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no -- they are upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. Never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weakest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no -- he only wanted his sister? If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you to no end.

This is by far the worst thing I have ever seen on film. My uncle&#39;s home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot summary is basically that these twin kick boxers are playing some sick survival game with a man and his private army on some island. The man has a very cheap paper maché looking hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is atrocious in this movie. There are scene changes at the drop of the hat. For instance, for at least 30 seconds we see some guy humming a song to himself which adds NOTHING to the movie. This has the worst dialogue I have ever heard of in my life, I don&#39;t think this movie could get any worse then it already is. I would describe it as a want to be chuck Norris action film gone wrong. And I hate chuck Norris.

Rock solid giallo from a master filmmaker of the genre, Sergio Martino. Fashioned from a marvelous screenplay by Ernesto Gestaldi, this shocking mystery often develops fascinating twists until the terrific finale which most might not see coming throughout the film. It&#39;s when everything has fallen into place that we can go, &#34;Ahh..&#34; The film revolves around the death of a husband(..in an airplane explosion)and the million dollars the wife receives from it. There are those with great interest in that money, one in particular being the dead man&#39;s mistress. The wife is Lisa(Ida Galli)and the mistress demanding half the money is Lara(Janine Reynaud). She tells Lisa she knows that the death was arranged by her to get the insurance money. Lara says she&#39;ll use her &#34;lawyer&#34;, Sharif(Luis Barboo)to get that money. So already, the film produces two possible suspects in the later murder of Lisa, who awaiting someone in Tokyo. George Hilton portrays Peter Lynch. Peter works for a company that investigates those who gain inheritance to see if the pay day was gathered under suspicious means. When, on his watch, Lisa is killed by a man dressed from head to toe in black in her hotel room, he is a possible suspect. He decides to do a little investigating himself, while also assisting Inspector Stavros(Luigi Pistilli)and Interpol agent, Benton(Tom Felleghy)on their quest to find a killer. The killer strikes several times eliminating anyone revolving around the missing million dollars confiscated by the one responsible for the murder of Lisa. Soon, the film follows a journalist, Cléo Dupont(the delicious, luscious Anita Strindberg)as she and Peter meet for a dinner where she could try and sniff out anything that might break a story for her. Soon they fall deeply in love, but it seems like anyone who is near Peter is killed. Soon someone attacks Cléo with an intent to kill which pushes the investigation further into uncharted territory. Why would anyone wish to harm a journalist with no real facts to damage the one killing off people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This giallo is quite clever and exciting to follow. The film never lulls which is quite remarkable since so much happens leaving open the question of the identity of the killer. This film follows the path of gialli with knife slashings because of a certain pattern the killer has taken(the throat and lower torso). The film&#39;s conclusion wraps up all the complex loose ends and is quite satisfying. The film has some unique camera angles, but delivers the goods in terms of driving the plot and the execution of the mystery.

Predictable parody, just about failed to impress throughout it&#39;s looooooong eight minutes. The only thing that made it worthwhile was the DO NOT COLORIZE line at the end credits. Shame something more entertaining wasn&#39;t put on the DVD, like Jonathan Ross&#39; enjoyable profile of Romero on &#39;The Incredible Strange Film Show.&#39;

I was one of the few non-liberals who showed up to see Steve&#39;s video. It was quite an experience... in propaganda film-making and boredom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of Michael Moore&#39;s visit to my local school, UVSC, but it turned out to be another liberal, slash-and-burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community. It sure seems self-serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s more surprising is to see all the &#39;10&#39; votes his homeys have posted here. Did they even see the video? Golly gee Batman, this must rank with All The President&#39;s Men! Their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, like stacking the votes at IMDb will help a lame movie. Maybe my vote will help balance this out.

For those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures, let me give you a little lesson in American film-making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Documentaries rely heavily on casting. You pick and choose characters you think will enhance the drama and entertainment value of your film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you have shot a ton of footage, you splice it together to make a film with ups and downs, turning points, climaxes, etc. If you have trouble with existing footage, you either shoot some more that makes sense, find some stock footage, or be clever with your narration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The allegation that the filmmakers used footage of locales not part of the movie (favelas next to beautiful beaches) does not detract from the value of the film as a dramatic piece and the particular image is one that resonates enough to justify its not-quite-truthful inclusion. At any rate, you use the footage you can. So they didn&#39;t happen to have police violence footage for that particular neighborhood. Does this mean not include it and just talk about it or maybe put in some cartoon animation so the audience isn&#39;t &#34;duped&#34;? Um, no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the hopeful ending, why not? Yes, Americans made it. Yes, Americans are optimistic bastards. But why end on a down note? Just because it&#39;s set in a foreign country and foreign films by and large end on a down note? Let foreigners portray the dismal outlook of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let us Americans think there may be a happy ending looming in the future. There just may be one.

Like &#39;Singin&#39; in the Rain&#39;, &#39;Cover Girl&#39; has a trio of two guys and a girl. In &#39;Cover Girl&#39;, Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief. He corresponds to Donald O&#39;Connor&#39;s funny man part in &#39;Singin in the Rain&#39;. In Cover Girl, Gene Kelly&#39;s love interest is Rita Hayworth and in &#39;Rain&#39;, it&#39;s Debbie Reynolds. That&#39;s where the comparison ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas &#34;Singin&#39; in the Rain&#39; is a classic American movie musical, &#39;Cover Girl&#39; is mediocrity incarnate. The story isn&#39;t very complicated. Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is a dancer in Danny MacGuire&#39;s low-rent nightclub in Brooklyn. Rusty decides to enter a Cover Girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher, John Coudair, who made an unsuccessful play for Rusty&#39;s grandmother years ago. Coudair introduces Rusty to Broadway producer Noel Wheaton who makes her into a star. Danny feels slighted when Rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick, Genius. At the last minute, with Rusty at the altar with Noel, she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to Danny. They live happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gene Kelly has the least developed part in the movie. All we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with Rusty. Coudair and Wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward Rusty and Phil Silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth&#39;s performance is the scene in which she gets drunk. This foreshadows what happened to her in real life. Anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked Hollywood, pined away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with full-blown Alzheimer&#39;s during the last years of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful. Gene Kelly has only one really excellent dance number and that&#39;s the scene where he dances with his &#39;alter ego&#39;. Earlier, the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of &#39;Make em Laugh&#39; from &#39;Singin&#39; in the Rain&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most annoying thing about &#39;Cover Girl&#39; is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal. A couple of decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. Both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities. They wanted to be known as &#39;actresses&#39; and not &#39;pinup girls&#39;. Unfortunately, &#39;Cover Girl&#39; is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.

My wife is a mental health therapist and we watched it from beginning to end. I am the typical man and can not stand chick flicks, but this movie is unbelievable. If you want to see what it is like for someone who is going through these type of struggles, this is the movie for you. As I watched it I found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Spoiler*** Plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie including the people in the mental institution were the actual people in real life made it that more real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must see for someone in the mental health profession!

This movie was just down right bad. I love war movies and can normally come away from most movies and find something that I liked,but this was not one of them. This movie lacked substance and intensity.OK I get it, the Finns put up one hell of a fight and thats great, but the story is poorly told. You don&#39;t have any real connection with any of the characters and there&#39;s no real story line to follow. You just go from one random scene to another, nothing flows to form the story that is trying to be conveyed. If you want a war movie that will keep you riveted, and amazingly enough without battles scenes, then I would suggest &#34;Downfall&#34; (WWII German film). Or if you prefer a great story line and a lot of action then I would suggest &#34;Brotherhood of War&#34; (Korean war/Korean film). These two movies will not let you down as Winter War will.

Aaah...The Thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see a horror film in which not only is every character over the age of thirty, but distinctly UNattractive, makes a refreshing change, and reminds me of those distant times when actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters, rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over-styled parodies. And there&#39;s no gimmicky &#39;twist&#39; ending, or cameo celebrity appearance, or lame pseudo-romantic subplot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I REALLY miss on-set physical effects; with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. In the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, An American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Company of Wolves, A Nightmare on Elm Street...what an era for horror effects! And don&#39;t get me started on the death of matte painting. The matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do we have now? Third rate CGI, former music video directors and professional stylists, that makes even &#39;gritty&#39; horror movies look like glossy MTV videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#39;m going to go Netflix &#39;The Howling&#39;.

It&#39;s okay ... a few years later Chayefsky&#39;s classic &#34;Network&#34; will be his true cinematic BIG home run ..., but for now, this dark comedy isn&#39;t the classic it aspires to be. It&#39;s mostly awful, although it has some good scenes: the first murder victim being found, the E.R. clerk responsible for billing patients making a surprise discovery, Drummond&#39;s delusional confessional, and the very last scene where Scott&#39;s character regains his professional integrity and self-respect. It also has some ludicrous scenes: Scott&#39;s character&#39;s whiny monologue during his early visit to the hospital psychiatrist, Scott&#39;s character&#39;s raping Rigg&#39;s character, Dysart&#39;s horrible mugging in his brief scenes, and the O.R. doctor pouncing on the operating table to resuscitate the wrong patient because &#34;I already have one malpractice lawsuit&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chayefsky also tries TOO HARD throwing every conceivable hurdle at this one hospital (i.e.- the murders, the administrative mistakes, the poor people protesting outside, etc). It might have worked better as a look at the industry as a whole. Acting-wise: Scott is passable, Rigg seems miscast, Hughes is inspired, and Dysart mugs through out his brief performance. The rest of the cast is TOO one-dimensional.

From the acting, direction, scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims. When did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children&#39;s movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Suess is rolling in his grave right now, what with the &#34;dirty ho&#34; &#34;S.H.I.T&#34; and fake erection scenes etc etc etc. Its shameful how they trade on the name of Suess to get the parents to bring their kids, throw in the profanities to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won&#39;t watch a a film with their child if there is no T &amp; A. Greed greed and more greed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare this to the classic children&#39;s films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into. These guys should stick to making MTV videos. How on earth this movie got &gt;400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me. (unless its the directors family)

The scenes are fast-paced. the characters are great. I love Anne-Marie Johnson&#39;s acting. I really like the ending. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was disappointed that this movie didn&#39;t delve deeper into Achilles&#39;s and Athena&#39;s relationship. It only blossomed when they kissed each other.

This video guide was the masterpiece of the year 1995. Beautifully done! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have major on-screen chemistry when they talk about what the Start button does. I&#39;m waiting for Microsoft to release a Special Edition DVD complete with deleted scenes, Bill Gates commentary, a documentary of how Windows 95 compares to Windows XP, and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 10/10 (Should have won at least a Golden Globe)

My first attempt at watching this ended in 8 minutes, roughly after the TV report scene, which I couldn&#39;t handle. It went approximately like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reporter 1: Hmm, there&#39;s a pyramid in our skies. Reporter 2: I think it&#39;s aliens. *awkward silence* Reporter 1: In other news...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later I watched it to the end, and it wasn&#39;t as horrible as I&#39;ve imagined, but there are serious problems with this. About half of the plot can be easily discarded. And the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What use are the detective, the eugenics people, and the monsters which are disposed of momentarily by Horus? More amusing was the monopoly scene. &#34;We&#39;re all powerful &#34;Gods&#34;, who have lived for aeons, and of all the games in the multiverse we happen to play monopoly.&#34; Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Erich von Dainiken looks coherent, compared to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other half is terribly lacking. What did our protagonist do to get himself cryo-frozen? Why was there no big event when he was released at the end? He had those pesky followers, remember? What happened to normal humans? What&#39;s the deal with the masked guy? How did the blue-haired girl appear? What&#39;s with her eyesight? Etcetera, etcetera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visually it&#39;s OK, more or less, if you disregard the Egyptian Gods looking like walking turds with rotweiller heads.

What a dog of a movie. Noni Hazelhurst&#39;s performance is quite good, but it sits amidst a jungle of abhorrent scriptwriting, mediocre direction and wooden acting from the bulk of the cast. Many of the characters are woefully miscast, particularly the ever overrated Colin Friels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very little works in this pretentious garbage. Much of the &#34;character development&#34; is done through a silly, angst-ridden voice over and frequently completely contradicts the behaviour of characters on-screen. In fact, it&#39;s hard to even figure out who the voice overs are talking about because they describe such different characters to who we see on screen! How are we meant to know Colin Friels (Javo) is meant to be an erratic, violent and unreliable junkie? One of these silly voice overs tells us. For crying out loud, the nature of his character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that lets us know is a flippin&#39; voice over! The real killer is the characters. Everything about them. Their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the rack, despite the fact we are constantly reminded they are meant to be artsy paupers. They are all absurdly well-spoken for &#34;junkies&#34;. None seem to have any real comprehension of life on the skids or on smack and yet this is meant to be the case with most of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monkey Grip deserves no more attention than a weekday TV movie matinée. Crud like this, perfectly well shot and technically presented, but a cliché-driven angsty drama that shoots so wide of being plausible and meanders about for hours without really going anywhere. At least Noni gets down to her birthday suit at every given opportunity. There&#39;s no other sane reason to endure this junk.

For all viewers out there who have slammed John Waters for creating a film like Pink Flamingos, just stop. It&#39;s getting you nowhere. Has anyone ever cared to stop and think about the ambition and dedication Mr.Waters possesses. To gather your best friends up and to create a movie just to gross out thousands of viewers all over shows this man has a great deal of ambition inside himself. Just read his biography Shock Value. It discusses the lengths he went through to get this film finished. Maybe it wasn&#39;t just the fact that John made this film to gross people out, it was to prove that there can be something such as good bad taste&gt;

I believe the production value is OK..probably deserves a 4/10 or 5/10.it&#39;s traditionally filmed,featuring good looking people with model quality and a little class..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but the premise let me annoyed..a decent woman would do such dirt? I mean she is gonna marry a man who would have sex with another woman? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and what&#39;s more serious she is also active in the behavior...... only in de Laclos&#39;s mind....the film also have many aspects that makes Eastern Europeans seem immoral&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after all, it&#39;s just movie, if it doesn&#39;t intend to degrade women in general, I will give one more point..but obviously, it does&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;conclusion: a nasty piece of crap with a little taste

It was released in France on dvd several years ago--I wish it would be re-released with English subtitles. Do not confuse this with a remake with Penelope Cruz which gets poor reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king. He sets off to join the army and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in an early movie for her. I won&#39;t spoil the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a great loss to moviedom.

This film has absolutely no redeeming features. It&#39;s not even worthy of being in the &#39;so bad it&#39;s good&#39; category - it&#39;s simply bad. Badly acted, badly shot, badly written, badly directed, terrible sound recording and the whole thing is just incredibly amateur. Quite how this got a release is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and could someone PLEASE tell the lead actress that if you&#39;re playing &#39;mad&#39; that does not mean that you should constantly fiddle with your hair - in a film that was generally irritating, this was probably one of the most irritating things of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I think this is the only film ever to feature a Nazi carjacker ...

The biggest problem with this film is that it&#39;s nothing like Bruce Allmighty. The first film played upon every daydreamer&#39;s fantasy of being able to control ones surroundings as one sees fit. Evan&#39;s experience though is entirely different. He has none of the control that Jim Carrey fools around with and instead the story centers around the power of belief. Now this would have been fine, since the first film was preaching the same message. The problem is that the sequel does it&#39;s preaching at the expense of the comic relief. And to add insult to injury it also throws in politics into the plot. You get the distinct feeling that there is a clear message with this film, and it&#39;s main objective is not to make you laugh. To sum things up this movie is failed mixture of Eddie Murhphy&#39;s &#34;The Distinguished Gentleman&#34; and Charlton Heston&#39;s &#34;The Ten Commandments&#34;. I&#39;m not sure if Steve Carrell is at fault here, you get a sense that it&#39;s his character that limits his abilities as a comedian, the former news anchor Evan Baxter is not supposed to be funny, he&#39;s basically an antagonist made into a protagonist which in this case only adds to the confusion of what this movies message is supposed to be about.

I saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in Pablo CO. I had just quit my biomedical engineering job at a hospital. I consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that goes on in hospitals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idiots that put it down on production value don&#39;t get the point and probably have never been hospitalized. And never worked in one for sure. Billy Jack (same era) was very poorly produced but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site I have found where it get mentioned.

The funny sound that you may hear when you eyeball this execrable version of Jules Verne&#39;s classic &#34;Journey to the Center of the Earth&#34; is Verne spinning in his grave. The only thing about this 80 minute opus that has anything to do with &#34;Journey to the Center of the Earth&#34; is the title. Otherwise, everything else in this lackluster production is new and not worth watching. In fact, the director has written here at IMDb.COM that he directed only eight minutes of &#34;Journey to the Center of the Earth&#34; and the studio tacked on part of &#34;Dollman&#34; helmer Albert Pyun&#39;s sequel to his own &#34;Alien from L.A.&#34; with Kathy Ireland. Evidently, the producers ran out of money and to satisfy overseas contractual obligations, they grafted Pyun&#39;s sequel onto director Rusty Lemorande&#39;s movie. Please, don&#39;t rent or buy this wretched piece of garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike director Henry Levin&#39;s period piece &#34;Journey to the Center of the Earth&#34; (1959) with James Mason and Pat Boone, Lemorande&#39;s &#34;Journey to the Center of the Earth&#34; takes place in contemporary times in Hawaii. Two fellows, a British nanny, and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence. Richard (Paul Carafotes of &#34;Blind Date&#34;) and his comic book obsessed brother Bryan (Ilan Mitchell-Smith of &#34;Weird Science&#34;) are going out to explore a cave. The heroine, Crystina (Nicola Cowper of &#34;Underworld&#34;), works for a domestic service called &#39;Nannies R Us.&#39; Being a nanny has been Crystina&#39;s life-long dream, but she has made a less of all five of her nanny jobs. Nevertheless, her sympathetic supervisor, Ms. Ferry (Lynda Marshall of &#34;Africa Express&#34;), sends her to Hawaii. Crystina&#39;s new client, rock star Billy Foul (Jeremy Crutchley of &#34;Doomsday&#34;) who is scheduling one last concert to revive his flagging career, has a dog named Bernard. Foul wants Crystina to take Bernard to a doggie day spa. Crystina is waiting on the arrival of her taxi when a careless motel attendant accidentally puts the basket that conceals Bernard in Richard&#39;s jeep. You see, Foul has hidden his canine in a basket because motel management strictly prohibits pets on their premises. Foul has disguised the dog as a human baby. Anyway, Crystina catches a cab and tells the driver follow Richard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After she catches up with them to get her dog, the cabbie cruises away and abandons her. Crystina demands that Richard drive her back to town, but he has other plans. Unhappily, Crystina joins the guys and they get lost, and then find themselves in the lost city of Atlantis, a police state ruled by a dictator, at the center of the Earth. The rulers of Atlantis repeatedly notify their citizens that life on the surface does not exist. Our heroes and heroine stumble onto Atlantis quite by accident. Atlantis resembles a disco and everybody looks like they are straight out of a punk rock opera. The ruler of Atlantis, General Rykov (Janet Du Plessis of &#34;Operation Hit Squad&#34;), is orchestrating a raid on the surface with clones of the first human, Wanda Saknussemm (Kathy Ireland of &#34;Necessary Roughness&#34;), to visit Atlantis. Predictably, General Rykov machinations to rule Atlantis and overthrow the Earth fails, and our heroes and heroine save the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Journey to the Center of the Earth&#34; is an abomination. The movie seems to be a comedy despite its superficial satire about dictatorships. Albert Pyun is one of my favorite low budget action directors, but he blew it on this lightweight shambles of a science fiction saga.

(Very light spoilers, maybe.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to watch this tonight. I had to switch it off before the second hour because I found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother. Both came across as self-absorbed with little regard for others, with the daughter also adding in rude, disrespectful and reckless to the mix. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was, &#34;At least we won&#39;t have to watch her anymore.&#34; Keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving, but it was too far gone for me by then. I simply wasn&#39;t enjoying it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to care for the protagonist, you need to get me caring about the characters much sooner--if it&#39;s nearly an hour in and I don&#39;t care, it&#39;s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supporting cast was sincere and well played--I felt for *them!*--and the gay best friend was wonderful, but even combined, that wasn&#39;t enough to carry the film for me.

I approach films about talking animals with care. For every wonderful one like Babe, you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of Cats &amp; Dogs, you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential. When I heard about Paulie, the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn&#39;t exactly fill me with confidence. But I found the film a pleasant surprise. And it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Russian janitor, Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) gets a job in a research laboratory. One day, he hears singing coming from the basement. And when he investigates, he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out. Misha becomes fascinated with the bird, especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing, it can talk. And not a few phrases either. Its a parrot you can actually make conversation with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parrot is called Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr), and recognises a fellow castaway in Misha. Wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, Misha convinces Paulie to tell him his life story. Which all began when he was a baby, and in the care of Marie, a five year old girl with a stutter. The two of them became birds of a feather (OK, bad pun!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Marie&#39;s parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away. And they finally did after Marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly. Desperate to be reunited with her, Paulie begins a long journey across America, which includes a diverse number of new owners, flying great distances, and even ending up behind bars. Of a cage that is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 90s. And although it wasn&#39;t afforded the same recognition or box-office success of Babe, Paulie succeeds on quite a few levels, and is an occasional work of striking intelligence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay Mohr&#39;s stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of Paulie. He never plays the part as too smug, even if he is a bit of a smart Aleck. Paulie&#39;s worldly, but he is also naive in his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because he&#39;s lived a rather sheltered life with Marie, when he&#39;s taken away, he has to fend for himself for the first time. And when he falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to Paulie to reunite him with Marie, which he believes. Only for those promises to be broken time and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paulie is admittedly a little episodic. It follows the eclectic people Paulie ends up with, and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to Marie. He first winds up in a pawn shop, where he is adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners. She sympathises with Paulie&#39;s situation, and drives an RV across America to find Marie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paulie is an occasionally very touching film. His scenes with Ivy are some of the best. Wonderful moments of Paulie perched on her shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers. The way she instills in him the need for hope is great, and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;There are things in life you put off, because you think you&#39;re gonna do them later. But the real thing Ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scene where Ivy passes away en route leaving Paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment. And the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the Grand Canyon, soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film&#39;s over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the occasional sad moment, there are plenty of laughs to be had. Paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a Spanish outdoor restaurant. The animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number. And Paulie even gets to have a romance. Which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief (played by Mohr as well). That may be the only complaint I have. As soon as you get comfortable with one situation, the film then moves Paulie on to another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATM machines is funny, but a little disturbing too. I&#39;m amazed DreamWorks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film. And Paulie&#39;s diamond robbery is very Mission Impossible. He&#39;s caught in the act, and shipped off to the lab for animal testing, where he&#39;s remained ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story finally comes full circle at the lab, where Misha vows to help Paulie. Of course they do find Marie. But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, I was left numb for several minutes. Paulie may never get the longevity Babe has, but I believe its an equally brilliant film. The same laughs. The same flawless effects. And the same surprising intelligence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor gem.

As a writing teacher, there are two ending I never allow my students to use: &#34;Then I woke up&#34; and &#34;Then I Got Run Over by a Truck.&#34; I am now going to add, &#34;Then I got a bump on the head.&#34; I feel it&#39;s utterly unfair to use these tricks to cover up a lack of imagination. The whole issue of transmigration could have been handled with some intelligence and craft, yet, in this film, they either couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t do that. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s totally worthless, but it is so predictable in its progress, except for the stupid ending. There are even gangsters who go to the police to get help from this guy. They should have done him in immediately. It&#39;s just a forgettable, borderline horror/sci fi film, with nothing new to offer.

For the life of me I can&#39;t figure out why anyone would make a movie like this. The plot is tired, the acting is strained, the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the &#34;F&#34; word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so &#39;let&#39;s throw in another couple of &#34;F&#39;s&#34; for good measure, that&#39;s what the American public wants to hear&#39;. Gossett was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part. Forget this c__p, rent &#39;Shrek&#34; and have a good laugh.

This movie is about a Dysfunctinal Family but Not just any Dysfunctional Family. It is about the Family of the Father of our Nation (India) although, the film focuses mainly on the estranged relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal Gandhi. It shows how The Mahatma had to kill M.K. Gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family life in order to achieve our freedom. Every time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son would try to get close the Mahatma would come between them. This is a beautifully done film. Akshaye Khanna has proved himself to be a Top Actor. He expressed emotions very naturally. Darshan Jariwala who mainly stars in Plays-Gurukant Desai&#39;s lawyer in Guru has portrayed Gandhi wonderfully.(as a real Human Being, unlike Ben Kingsley who made him look like a God) Shefali Shah the girl from Monsoon Wedding has also done a really good job of showing how Kasturba Gandhi was torn between father and son. This Movie is touching and so is its soundtrack &#34;Raghupati Raghava&#34; sung in a very unique manner. I saw this movie just 3 hours ago(it released in Dubai a day earlier-on the 2nd) and when the movie was over there was &#34;Pin Drop Silence&#34; and while exiting out of the Theatre not ONE person pushed another( Can you imagine us Indians not pushing ?) NOT ONE ! There was a Sacred Silence...

Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his Chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic. He plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer, but he can&#39;t avoid running into his old friends. He had been arrested originally not for any drug-related charge, but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game. His skill at poker has earned him the nickname of The Man with the Golden Arm, and the men who run the game, one of them being his former heroin connection, want him to deal again. Meanwhile, Frank has to take care of a woman whom he injured in a car accident, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), and make up with his old girlfriend, Molly (Kim Novak). The film is great at putting us in Sinatra&#39;s mental state. When he feels sure of himself at the beginning of the film, I felt good for him. But, when a promised phone call doesn&#39;t come one day, he descends into depression and goes back on the smack. Later, when he finally gets to audition, he arrives completely strung out. His embarrassment when he can&#39;t play the correct beat is devastating. He had such big dreams, and the other musicians don&#39;t even pay him a bit of attention as he rushes out of the room. The film moves quickly and it shows Frank&#39;s drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a social message picture. The actors are uniformly fine. Elmer Bernstein&#39;s score is one of the best of its time. The only thing I don&#39;t like about the film is the ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILERS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I really like the character of Zosch and Parker is very good in the film, they could have done a little more to fill in her backstory. The ending is a little too pat. While there is surely pathos that will remain with the characters after the film closes, Zosch&#39;s death ties up all the loose ends a bit too neatly. Frank is free to love Molly and he won&#39;t go to jail. Also, his dealer is dead, so at least the immediate threat is gone. Well, I guess in Hollywood there&#39;s always a desire to tie everything up in a neat little package. It harms the film a little, but, as it stands, it&#39;s still one of the best and most adult movies about drug addiction I can think of. 9/10.

Oh dear! The first time I heard of this bad show was when one of my friends was yelling like an idiot &#34;JOHNY TEST&#34; while we were playing video games. I thought he was confusing &#34;Johny Quest&#34; (by the way, one of the best cartoons I&#39;ve ever seen in my life&#34;, and changing the &#34;Quest&#34; with &#34;Test&#34;. Its something weird that I&#39;m wrong, but actually I was wrong, he wasn&#39;t changing nothing, he heard of this show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, while watching TV, I heard that Cartoon Network was going to be released. I wasn&#39;t sure of what was the plot of this show, so I adventured myself to watch it, and here is my answer &#34;I WANT MY DAMN HOUR BACK&#34; (Because I watched this crap and &#34;My Gym Partner&#39;s a Monkey&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the worst shows I&#39;ve ever seen. First, the beginning, with the most stupid song in the world, then the plot. Oh, where are my manners? I haven&#39;t said the plot of this show. Is about a boy who has to AMAZINGLY INTELLIGENT sisters, that have a lab and make experiments with their own brother. OHHH, now I see why his name is Johny TEST, he is the test of his sisters experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, I honestly miss Dexter&#39;s Lab (before it was transformed to the NEW Dexter, a total crap too). This is a bad copy of that old good show, except that this show is amazingly bad. Don&#39;t watch it, make something more productive in that half-hour than watch this crap.

The biggest reason I had to see this movie was that it stars Susan Swift, an outstanding and all-too-underappreciated actress. Time travel movies usually don&#39;t interest me and neither do movies about witchcraft, but this movie was fascinating and creepy. It didn&#39;t rely on outrageous special effects and it didn&#39;t focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer gets lost and confused. This was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all.

Absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality. It has Camp Councellor Angela(Pamela Anderson..awful as the killer;her quips when she wastes people aren&#39;t even amusing)on the warpath slaying teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleadings for good behavior. We run the gamut of boring, clichéd killings such as the slashing to the throat to one kid looking for his Freddy clawed glove, a kid who gets a chainsaw, one girl who gets drilled, one who gets shoved into the crapper(filled with leeches), one who is roasted, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#39;t have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time. That is unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen&#39;s(who plays the slut Ally)tits. Most of the violence occurs off-screen so even that will not satisfy.

I saw this recently on a faded old VHS tape, and remembered it dimly. Looking at it now, it seems charming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was first released, it was recognized by pretty much everyone as a spoof of coming out as a gay teenager. To hammer the point home, the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of &#34;1 Teenager In 10&#34;, the most popular coming out book of the time. David Warner hams it up as the persecuting vampire hunter [= gay-hating evangelist], who is of course a self-loathing closet case. The list of sight gags and in-jokes that were included to make sure nobody missed the point would be too long to go into. The producers were having some good-natured fun, and hoping, no doubt, to lighten-up as well as to enlighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have no clue how a teenage audience would look at this film, nowadays. In some places, where there is education and culture, the terrifying ordeals that gay teens had to go through are a thing of the past. But I&#39;m sure there are plenty of dark, nasty corners of our continent where it&#39;s just as bad as it always was.

Being a D.B. Sweeney fan, I&#39;ve been on the lookout for this movie for quite some time. I recently rented the video and found it very enjoyable. It had some really hilarious scenes. The dysfunctional lives of some of the characters was unsettling, but I think the movie also showed that it&#39;s possible to keep your life on track or get it back on track if it&#39;s been derailed.

This is a great film Classic from the 40&#39;s and well produced. There are very dramatic scenes in this film with John Garfield,(Al Schmid),&#34;Force of Evil&#34;,&#39;48 and Dane Clark,(Lee Diamond),&#34;Last Rites&#34;,&#39;88, fighting the Japs during WWII being completely surrounded and with only one machine-gun. When Al Schmid was able to go home after being wounded with a horrible injury, his problems just started to begin with his family and engaged girl friend. Dane Clark gave an outstanding supporting role as Lee Diamond, who did everything to help his buddy Al get his life together again. There is never a complete victory to War and lets not forget all the Brave Wounded Military personnel in Veterans Hospitals from All the Wars and our present Iraq Vets!

with this film being directed by Roger Avery and Quentin Tarantino doing the screenplay i was sure this was going to be a gem. i was wrong. i don&#39;t hate this film but in no ways do i like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love Roger Avery because of his amazing direction in rules of attraction and his screenplays to pulp fiction and silent hill but he made a mistake making this. do i really need to comment on Tarantino, we all know hes a genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this movie is just set around a gang robbing a bank but fails due to silly people participating in the robbery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#39;m disappointed in Tarantino and Avery for doing this film but doesn&#39;t change my mind on how amazing they both are. everyone makes mistakes......... 3/10...........j.d Seaton

ALICE is the kind of movie they made in the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s. Never attempts to be an &#34;event&#34;. Just wants to entertain. And it does. I was surprised by Kiefer Sutherland. In a role that could be a cliche, he made it real. The plot does make allusions to ALICE IN WONDERLAND. A guy dressed in white does go through a hole and Kiefer does fall down one. Like ALICE the plot does twist and turn, but with a freshness you don&#39;t see in small movies. I loved the direction, Sutherland, just a very fast paced and interesting movie.

With the exception of FAMILY, this new season is worse than Season One. I can&#39;t imagine what they are thinking. As a fan of horror, can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem, but this series gets worse with each outing. I can&#39;t imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day, toiling to churn out such crap. STORY! Is that too much to ask for? CHARACTER! How can we give damn about the fate of ANYONE in these stories? If we are not engaged, who cares if they get carved up or whatever? Almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting, going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or REASON why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting. Even Dante&#39;s effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion. Ironically, the production values and performances tend to be up to speed, while the content is utter crap. I have great hopes for Exec Producer&#39;s Garris&#39;s VALARIE UNDER THE STAIRS, but we shall see.

I&#39;m Mike Sedlak. I co-wrote the score for this movie. And proud of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I love all of the comments. Some have not gone far enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie premiered in San Francisco in the summer of 1973. The theater was packed with friends and family. We all clapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five days latter, it was pulled from all of the screens in the Bay Area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is interested hearing some of scene by scene details, which might make the movie even more enjoyable, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could start with the shot where Gideon Blake throws the toilet plunger to distract one of the evil henchmen guarding the radio transmitter on the deck of Bud&#39;s house. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or how Gideon diffused the bomb in the original version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#39;t help. It still bombed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring it on.

This was a very disappointing movie. I would definitely call this the worst movie of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting and writing were poor. And the jokes were not funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t see why on earth this piece of crap was even made. I&#39;m not a picky person and I can enjoy stupid things but this is just way too stupid and just plain awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this wretched piece of garbage at all costs!

Where to begin? How about with the erroneous synopsis: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine&#39;s epically violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed, and the ominous Weapon X program.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His epically violent past turns out to exceptionally non-violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His relationship with Creed is so glossed over it&#39;s difficult to understand how they have any connection at all. We are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run, to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan, and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of assassins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all. Nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The romantic element of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and abrupt. We are thrown into a romance so fast that it&#39;s over before you can blink an eye. Having just introduced the character, Silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later. We are left wondering why we should care about this. Who was she anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story, the romance is surprisingly unexplored. It was rushed in simply because it was required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, when Wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find Sabertooth. Being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the weapon X program, lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure Wolverine is up and running. Eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple. Surprisingly Ma and Pa Kent aren&#39;t alarmed when finding a naked sweaty man in their barn. Is it any wonder what fate awaits them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the previous films and the comic books, the main reason that Wolverines&#39; amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldblooded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing this was the case...did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As hinted to in X2: X-men United when Stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together. This film sets up the team fairly well only they don&#39;t really do much of anything. No disturbing violence, no ruthless actions, they merely harass a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that Wolverine wasn&#39;t an evil man under Stryker at all. Instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother Sabertooth which consequently WAS the violent agent we all thought Wolverine was. Eventually he just leaves all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No conflict of duality here at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Idiotically REMOVING that character conflict of good and evil DULLED the story immensely. They may as well have given him rubber claws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the X-Men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the lamest Deus Ex Machinas to ever hit a script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic memory-erasing bullets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently they are the only thing to bring down Wolverine. Yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on Wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all. Interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story. Most were in the film for 5-10 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of Wolverine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred Dukes (the Blob but not the comic version) can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all, but a simple headbutt from Wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyclops optic beams (which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers) can burn through buildings but when fired at Sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes. Adamantium trench coats anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The (gravity defying) mutant Gambit, instead of utilizing his signature cards, is made into some sort of crazy acrobat. In one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by Wolverine...then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running TOWARDS Wolverine. How he regained consciousness, ran away a few blocks, climbed up a building, then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash. The idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comic book source material, the REAL origin of Wolverine...is a story worth bringing to the screen. It doesn&#39;t sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless CGI junkies. It is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time, began with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor-Smith. A much more intense and exciting story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This FOX film should seriously be forgotten. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone have that magic gun?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10

As a fan of author John le Carre I&#39;ve slowly been working my way through both his books and the adaptations of them. I found this 1987 adaptation of le Carre&#39;s masterwork at my local library and sat down to watch it thinking I would know what to expect. I was surprised to discover that my expectations were exceeded in this miniseries, a fine cross between a spy thriller and a human drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Egan gives a great performance as Magnus Pym, the perfect spy of the title. Carrying on in the long tradition of le Carre&#39;s strong main characters, Pym is also quite possibly the best. Egan plays Pym (who in fact contains many shades of author le Carre) as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and betraying sometimes out of circumstance and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming &#34;a perfect spy&#34;. Egan plays Pym to perfection as a man always on the run, if not from others then from himself. Egan alone makes the six or so hours of this miniseries worth seeing from his performance alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surronding Egan is a fantastic supporting cast. Ray McAnally gives one of his finest performances as Pym&#39;s con man father Rick who (as le Carre has said) is based strongly on the author&#39;s own father. McAnally plays a man who comes in and out of Pym&#39;s life and is one of the those responsible for Pym becoming &#34;a perfect spy&#34;. In fact if it wasn&#39;t for McAnally&#39;s performance a year after this in A Very British Coup this would the finest performance of his sadly too short career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the supporting is excellent as well. From Caroline John as Pym&#39;s mother to Alan Howard as his spy mentor to Rüdiger Weigang as the young Pym&#39;s friend turned controller to Jane Booker as Pym&#39;s wife the supporting cast is fantastic. Special mention should be made of the three young actors who played the younger Pym (Jonathan Haley, Nicholas Haley and Benedict Taylor) who establish the young man who would become the man played so well By Peter Egan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The production values of the miniseries are strong as well. As the miniseries adaptations of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley&#39;s People proved these stories can only be told in miniseries format. The locations are excellent from the English locations to the those scattered across Eastern Europe and the USA as are the sets by Chris Edwards. The cinematography of Elmer Cossey adds an extra layer of realism to the world of the miniseries. Yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screenwrtier Arthur Hopcraft tackled the job of adapting the six hundred or so page novel excellently. The novel was largely (at least in its early parts) autobiographical in that Pym&#39;s early life echoed much of John le Carre&#39;s life. The script for this miniseries is no exception as it traces the development of Magnus Pym from young boy to &#34;a perfect spy&#34;. Never once does the miniseries deviate from its purpose of telling a fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage. If one ever wants proof that a spy thriller can be tense and fascinating without ever having one gun fight, fist fight, or James Bond style car chase this would be the proof. While the miniseries is six plus hours long it never wastes a moment and it all the better for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it might be overlong for some for those who don&#39;t have very short attention spans here is a must see. From the performances of Peter Egan and Ray McAnally to fine production values and a fine literary script A Perfect Spy is one of the finest miniseries who can expect to see. It is a fascinating trip down the history of the Cold War yet it is more then that. It is also a trip down what John le Carre has called &#34;the secret path&#34;: the path of the spy the man who must lie and betray to survive. As much a human drama as a spy thriller A Perfect Spy isn&#39;t to be missed.

This movie is so bad they should burn the master. You cant spoil the plot because this movie doesn&#39;t have one. The graphics are less than fake, they&#39;re horrendous. Then you&#39;ve got the rambling through the countryside star gazer work-a-holic who bounces between his own lunacy &amp; the mad rantings of the crazed preacher. &amp; when he finally makes it to DC, they don&#39;t even have the decency to kill him; the monster (which you don&#39;t know at the time) is already dieing but how ... who knows &amp; of course it has the ultimate sappy ending... everybody else on the planet is dead or dieing but his family &amp; a handful of stragglers survive. Imagine that! This will be the movie that C Thomas Howell will go to his grave regretting he ever starred in. It probably gives him nightmares.

The whole set-up of this contrived Disney family film (ad-exec gets his teenage daughter a horse because she &#34;wants one more than anything else in the world&#34;) is just an excuse to film the big climactic horse-show at the end. All the other ingredients (the ad campaign for the stomach pill, Kurt Russell as a potential boyfriend for the youngster, Lloyd Bochner as a potential rival for Dean Jones over the affections of Diane Baker) are shelved near the end simply to showcase the horse. Over half the picture is padding, and worse: it is whiny and obnoxious. The kid is the ninny-sort who cries on the couch with a dog in her arms, and as usual she gets her way. * from ****

I was an extra on this film but wish i wasn&#39;t because its rubbish. the worst thing about this film is the music but the acting, script, editing, directing and story are terrible as well. the main reason its bad is because the budget is so low and the only way to make good film on a low budget is to have a good script. the script which should have been ripped up before the film was made isn&#39;t funny, i didn&#39;t laugh once. what did make me laugh is how makers probably think the most important thing was getting the film made, who cares if its total rubbish. the film needed about million pound more budget and a better writer. the only reason i didn&#39;t give the film one out of ten is because i felt sorry for the guy who is gonna lose a few hundred grand making this, if you do go and see it just make sure your drunk at the time. ha ha

Certainly when I saw this movie at HBO, I was bit erratic in following the plot, but it catches my attention when seeing Dustin Hoffman in it. Honestly I&#39;m not enthralled watching old movies, but then in the long run it changes my point of view. Seeing this stirring film made me experience once again couching at my seat not noticing my tears suddenly roll down my cheek, and then after, let loose a heavy sigh in realizing the impact of what I&#39;ve just witness. Kramer vs Kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama movies I&#39;ve witnessed for a long time that even I, myself couldn&#39;t imagine how it touched me. The story was strongly emotional, but is not saturated with such. The characters weren&#39;t unrealistic for their roles; they possess qualities that make viewers like them whatever position they have in the film, like the role of Meryl Streep, she was a mother who honestly concede her mistakes at the past but then she&#39;s confident to stand up her emotional motives to get what she desires in a fair and square battle. Dustin Hoffman was way too outstanding, I can&#39;t even fathom how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role which is completely different, then performed it well. Even though I have already seen the movies a lot of times, when I seat back and lounge at my home scanning worth movies to peer and buy a time for it, catching a glimpse for Kramer vs Kramer will make my experience another worthwhile moment.

I&#39;m surprised that mine, so far, is the only comment on this t.v. movie...as far as I&#39;m aware, the series itself, has had a huge following, reviewer pundits and real people alike, have praised it to a person. Anyway, let me tell you right away that, if like me, you&#39;re a sucker for gritty police dramas, you&#39;ll like &#34;The Lost Child&#34; Tennison, the heroine, throughout the &#34;Prime Suspect&#34;series, has been battling the male police establishment, throughout the series, getting to her present, comparatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy through hard work,obstinacy, and sheer talent for police work. She is,essentially, an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic side and is certainly no man-hater. Unfortunately her relationships are affected by the wicked hours, which her career demands, and she has never married, so when she finds herself pregnant from her latest affair, she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother, and jeopardising her entire police job, let alone future advancement, or having an abortion - which she opts for. This abortion never looms large in the ensuing drama - it&#39;s very skilfully dealt with, in less than a couple of minutes screentime, a marvel of economy in scripting, and editing - but it&#39;s always there, as a counterpoint to Tennison&#39;s desperate efforts to find another &#34;lost child&#34; - a kidnap victim - before it&#39;s too late. The story takes many twists and turns,before the surprise ending, and one is fascinated, alike, by the plot, and characters (although I found the many villains a little overdrawn), the police, and especially Tennison, herself, are not always competent, nor that likeable, which figures, given the unpleasant job that they have to do, in the sleazy underworld which this series, habitually inhabits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirren, herself, has said that she&#39;ll make no more movies in the series, but, excellent as she&#39;s always been in the role of Tennison, the series, itself, is as &#34;actor proof&#34; as is another addiction of mine -Dick Wolf&#39;s American&#34;Law &amp; Order&#34; - whoever appears therein, each could go on forever. As is my fervent hope.

Oh Sex Lives of the Potato Men, what foul demon created thee? This is a film that you watch, smirk a little during the runtime and then when you mention it to others having seen it, you just cannot help but smile as you talk. But it&#39;s not that Sex Lives of the Potato Men is actually a funny film and one that inspires you to smile when talking or thinking about it, it&#39;s just that the film is so bizarre; is so insulting and is no shameless in its attempt to get across a meek laugh to do with sex and sex lives in general that you just cannot help but have your mouth break out into a grin. Do bear in mind that what follows the smirk is a sinking of the head; a consequent shake of the head and a raise of the index finger and thumb to both eyebrows as you gently rub them in an attempt to reminisce about your time watching this trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#39;s what the film is, it&#39;s trash; it&#39;s very brave and shameless trash but trash none-the-less. Whoever came up with this idea, put it to paper and then spread it around the industry trying to get it made must either be very brave or very desperate. It&#39;s strange to have a film that is most definitely &#39;about&#39; something but one that does not have, under any sort of circumstance, a decisive narrative. This follows on from that idea that most of European cinema is artistic and its stories are ambiguous and open-ended and themes take precedence over most other things. In Sex Lives of the Potato Men, the same situation and technically the same joke are replayed over and over again and that is an ideation that consists of: &#39;sex is a very, very funny thing.&#39; These ideas are perhaps more suited to an American film so it&#39;s no wonder that after a while watching this film, things start to feel a little out of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film begins and ends in the same manner, creating a feeling of a circular journey; a circular journey that has gone absolutely nowhere and absolutely nothing has been achieved. Three blokes sit around a table talking and what-not. Their boss joins them and the conversation is limited to whatever crude and disgusting stories, situations or scenarios each can possibly think of. The odd thing here, being that whenever one man says something nasty, the other grimaces but has an equally filthy story to give in return creating a contradiction in what these men find to cross the line and what they do not. The men are Dave (Vegas) and Ferris (Crook), two people joined by Tolly (Coleman) whenever the film sees fit to throw in a third face to crack some more nasty sex jokes or break some peculiar stories. They are employed by Jeremy (Gattis), a man who has deeper issues and problems but issues of which the film is more concerned with exploiting for the sake of humour rather than study.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#39;s the situation in Sex Lives of the Potato Men? The three to four men are in a crisis and for the duration of the film, we will adopt the role of the hapless fly on the wall as we witness what foul play these people get up to over the period of about a week. If the humour revolving around Dave and Ferris is disgusting and repulsive, then for Jeremy things are just spooky. It all begins rather innocently and it appears there is a female he likes and one who equally likes him in return but when the essence that Jeremy is merely a stalker creeps in, that&#39;s when the jaws drop. The character of Jeremy is used and put across in a way that makes unrequited love and stalking in general merely look &#39;funny&#39;. Jeremy sits in his apartment listening to classical music and writing out letters of abuse to Ruth (Davis), echoing some sort of psychotic persona more associated with Hannibal Lecter writing his letter&#39;s to Clarice in 2001&#39;s Hannibal. But whatever sympathy we might have for him at this point is rendered absolutely false when, later on, it is revealed the true origin of their relationship. Suddenly, we as an audience feel cheated into feeling a mite sorry for him earlier on and for whatever reason he did do what he did in the first place just seems cowardly and distasteful. To say what it was would ruin whatever few surprises lurk within the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite sad how, in one of Jeremy&#39;s letters, he writes about something-or-other exclaiming it to have &#34;No artistic vision  just one big mess&#34;. I hate it when words said by the characters echo the film they&#39;re in. Sex Lives of the Potato Men does not explore someone&#39;s psyche or particular interest in a fetish or why they feel the need to go around having as much sex as possible, it just uses them as a front to pile on ridiculously unfunny jokes and situations. Rather than take group sex and explore what drives a person to seek it down, it makes a daft joke out of it (tickets with numbers on!?); rather than get into the mindset of a fan of Sadomasochism, the film has someone hang from a basement ceiling and warn everyone of &#39;incoming salt and vinegar&#39; as he climaxes. Ferris covers his face in disgust and the camera fades to the next scene without too much of a fuss. It&#39;s a relief the film got to no audiences abroad. This is one section of British culture, indeed of the British mentality that I pray will be confined to our shores and ignored accordingly.

Especially after watching THE MATRIX RELOADED!! *SPOILERS*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing the Matrix with all it&#39;s ridiculous fantasy make-believe-robotic characters with their super powers, it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in situations that involved actual risk! I cared about these people, and even though some of the stunts seemed a bit much, it still left me feeling like &#34;it&#39;s possible&#34; verses &#34;what a stupid video game&#34; (like the Matrix)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie isn&#39;t brain surgery, it&#39;s very straight forward. Some things are predictable- like knowing that someone is going to be a back-stabber and that someone early on is going to die. Pretty obvious, but SO WHAT? The first 15 minutes sets up our reason, our motive, our main objective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that Theron and Walhberg didn&#39;t have any make-out scenes. I am glad that they didn&#39;t go there. They kept it about funny dialogue ESPECIALLY SETH GREENE. That guy IS FUNNY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a movie that I would buy when it comes out on DVD. It&#39;s fun, fast and entertaining. The only thing (and I guess it&#39;s a big thing) is that we are really - rooting for the bad guys. This group of protaganists are already on the wrong side of the law. Not a good message for the kiddies - parents, please explain this to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I saw this very emotionally painful portrayal and it was fascinating. The conflict between the public and private faces of Williams and the pressure he was under is illuminated in a way that even those who knew something about him would be surprised. The cast acted superbly, but Michael Sheen was outstanding. I only realised it was him when I saw the earlier comment. He looks completely physically different in this role, from any other role I have seen him in or as himself. Williams autobiography differs markedly from his diaries,as represented in this film. The film is at times distressing to watch, because of the emotional anguish displayed. However, it is a worthwhile experience and a film that can be recommended highly.

This movie would receive a much higher vote from me in general and I will talk about why, but first and foremost it receives four stars and should stay at four stars because of the directors ridiculously tasteless portrayal of rape and sexual assault. Not far into the movie Oyama sexually assaults a woman he rescued earlier, and while she briefly becomes somewhat miffed by his actions this attitude only lasts about five minutes before loving adoration sets in and carries her character through the rest of the film. I know many will argue that it&#39;s not that important in a kung fu beat-em-up, and as a fan of the genera I can&#39;t say that it&#39;s all that unusual, but that doesn&#39;t stop it from being completely tasteless every time I see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I will say in this movie&#39;s defence however is that it&#39;s somewhat refreshing to see a martial arts, or even action movie of any sort, that offers no actual hero for the viewer to get behind. Oyama is portrayed as a rapist and murderer; a societal outcast whose only student becomes completely mentally unbalanced before being gunned down by the police. The final shots of the movie leave one with the feeling that Oyama himself is poised for a major breakdown and no longer seems to care for the woman he earlier assaulted into loving him and has since followed him with puppy-dog like devotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether this was truly the intended message of the movie or not, one can&#39;t help but feel a little hopeful that Oyama might be on the brink of suicide by the time the movie is over. This is a rare emotional treatment from the martial arts genre and its interesting to see a film that leaves you with a sense that its violence is not to be celebrated. If only Karate Bullfighter had treated the subject of sexual violence better, either by creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters involved, or by leaving it out all together, this would have been a much more interesting film.

This is halfway to being a top movie. The opening section, which spoofs Hollywood &#34;social message&#34; films is absolutely brilliant. It is a riot from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second section, which introduces us to the main characters of the story is really great too. We get a lot of great comic setups, top notch performances, and the dialog is really dynamic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Spoiler warning!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one think that really annoyed me about this film though is the ending, which I think contradicts everything that went before. My interpretation was that this film was taking the mickey out all the silly prejudices and innuendo of small town gossip and national tabloid sensationalism. I loved that the film was championing the cause that a person&#39;s sexuality is NOT determined by their hobbies, idiosyncrasies, fashion sense or whatever. And then the ending goes and re-enforces all the gossip and stereotypes that the movie successfully lampooned in the first place. It turns out everyone was 100% right!!! (godamit!) This was very disappointing to what was actually a great story.

This movie was supposed to have depicted a &#39;ladie&#39;s man&#39; bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all. However, I did not care for his mission to settle down, because I didn&#39;t care for his character. I don&#39;t understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class, or charisma. He should&#39;ve at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing, but to no avail. Just because he is a musician does not make him sexy. Not to mention, the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. Does this man have any shame what-so-ever? Had he tidied up, and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character, but alas, his character was bland and boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gina Gershon&#39;s character was unnecessarily British. She could&#39;ve just as easily been an uptight out-of-towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor British accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only two characters I cared for were the fish and frog. Now those two had chemistry! Academy nominations for both STAT! Plot holes, lack of character development, horrible acting, unnecessary drama, cliché moments... What a mess of a movie.

Rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the Windy City, contrarian director Otto Preminger decided to go the opposite way and make his movie appear as artificial as possible, thus flying in the face of the fashion set by men like Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann, who were making their pictures all over the world. Nelson Algren, on whose novel the movie is based, went on record as despising it. What, one wonders, was Preminger up to, and why did he do the movie this way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a Mr. Magoo cartoon. Louie, the drug pusher, is attired as to resemble the sort of gangster the artists at Mad magazine used to draw. Arnold Stang, wonderful comedian that he was, seems out of place in a serious picture like this, and his very appearance, topped off by an exaggerated and over-sized baseball cap, elicits laughter. Robert Strauss, another actor best known for humorous roles, is likewise out of place, as his large, heavily jowled face and Runyonesque delivery of lines seems more appropriate to a Jerry Lewis movie. Against all this, stars Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker have to work overtime to just keep the viewer from snickering. Sinatra is jittery and manic throughout, suggesting a man ill at ease with himself, hence wholly appropriate for the role of a drug addict. Miss Novak, plant-like and sublimely deadpan, is sympathetic and seems a product of the artfully dingy slums she graces in the film. Parker is pure Hollywood and very hard-working as the crippled and crafty Zosch. She is never convincing, but then neither is the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#39;t recommend this movie to anyone interested in a realistic depiction of the lives of drug addicts in America. The Caligari sets alone make it unbelievable. Preminger may have been aiming for a dream effect, as the cardboard backgrounds give the proceedings the surreal feeling of a nightmare operetta, perhaps harking back to Preminger&#39;s early days in Vienna.

I have rented this film out about 6 times! it is very well directed and the story is unique and grabs your attention from the beginning. Big up to Jason Donovan whose acting in this film was wicked and i loved the guy with the st fighter moves - goood!

I had been waiting eagerly to see this movie, but when I finally got the chance, I was very disappointed. I had to stop half-way (or was it quarter-way?) because of the poor script and directing. Not to mention the poor cast! Josh Hartnett is the only one who can act, and he&#39;s much more suitable to be the hero of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, basically the story is just about a loose girl from the country who cheated on her long-time decent boyfriend only to have meaningless sex with a spoiled rich brat. This movie failed to draw my sympathy, not even when the writer intended to. I wonder where the moral values go?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors are so stiff that when I resume the movie (few weeks after it was interrupted due to its boring nature), they still failed to make me pay attention. The spoiled couple can only disgust me! What a movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think all the people involved in this production need to sit down and review it together so that they won&#39;t make the same mistakes next time round. And next time they might consider Josh Hartnett as the protagonist...

This is one of the worst movies I&#39;ve seen in a while. The acting was just soooo bad. Anthonie Kamerling is usually a fairly good actor, but in this film, he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper. Especially his voice over was extremely wooden. Beau van Erven Dorens was completely over the top as frat boy Fraser, although this probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue. &#39;Ik ook van jou&#39; is an adaptation of a book, and it seem like the makers of the film forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue. It all sounded way to bookish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the situations were very badly visualized. Example: somewhere at the beginning of the film there is a scene where a canoe goes over in a rapid. This bit is just too incredible to be true. You see an obviously rather shallow bit of river, with a lot of rocks right beneath the surface (hence the rapid). We hear some suspenseful music to warn us that there&#39;s danger ahead. A canoe with to girls goes over in that rather shallow rapid. Our hero then dives several meters below the surface to rescue one of the girl. Girl swoons in his arms and utters the words &#39;You saved me...&#39; Vomit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually was so bad, that it became funny. This is sad, because it really wasn&#39;t intended. At the intermission I overheard some guy behind me say &#39;O god, there&#39;s another part!&#39; My feelings exactly. What scares me is that the end credits of &#39;Ik ook van jou&#39; were in English. Does this mean that it will be released abroad? Just when the Netherlands were starting to get a good reputation after films like &#39;Antonia&#39; (Antonia&#39;s line) and &#39;Karakter&#39; (Character)...

One must admit, that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent. He gave a break to Zeenat Aman, a successful model, and also former winner of beauty pageant&#39;s title, by casting her in a role, which was tailor-made for her debut. Her bespectacled , stoned look, and her swaying at the hypnotizing music, made her an instant darling of the viewers. This movie is a treat to the eyes, with it&#39;s scenic locales, ethnic people, those Buddha temples, and chirpy, naughty Mumtaz, who looks quite attractive, in her ethnic wear, and dancing skills. Dev is of course, adorable, and this is one of his commercially successful performance. Hare Rama manages to keep the interest going, with it&#39;s carefully written script, editing, and captivating music. Like Des Pardes, his another movie, Anand has handled the topic of youngsters falling in the habit of drug addiction, and the theory of them coming from disturbed families, and troubled childhood, is quite plausible. A good entertainer, this movie retains it&#39;s freshness till date !

In the tradition of G-Men, The House On 92nd Street, The Street With No Name, now comes The FBI Story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light. While it&#39;s 48 year director J. Edgar Hoover was alive, it would be showed in no other kind of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book by Don Whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from it&#39;s founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film The FBI Story came out. It&#39;s important sometimes to remember there WAS an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover headed it. Some of that time is covered in the film as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Warner Brothers was not making a documentary so to give the FBI flesh and blood the fictional character of John &#39;Chip&#39; Hardesty was created. Hardesty as played by James Stewart is a career FBI man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In real life the Bureau was headed by William J. Burns of the Burns Private Detective Agency. It was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film. Burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the Harding administration. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in, he did just that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the Hardesty family which is Stewart and wife Vera Miles we see the history of the FBI unfold. In addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the FBI&#39;s story itself. Stewart and Miles are most assuredly an all American couple. We follow the FBI through some of the cases Stewart is involved with, arresting Ku Klux Klan members, a plot to murder oil rich Indians, bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties, their involvement with apprehending Nazi sympathizers in World War II and against Communist espionage in the Cold War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a kind of prologue portion where Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own. That involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight. Nick Adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course if The FBI Story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all American. Still the FBI does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FBI Story is not one of Jimmy Stewart&#39;s best films, but it&#39;s the first one I ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me. If the whole FBI were made up Jimmy Stewarts, I&#39;d feel a lot better about it. There&#39;s also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vera Miles didn&#39;t just marry Stewart, she in fact married the FBI as the film demonstrates. It&#39;s dated mostly, but still has a good and interesting story to tell.

I really didn&#39;t like this film. The plot was very predictable. Typical American plot, I&#39;m sorry. Guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end. And London has a Monorail? Bank of London??? Bank of England is what it really is!! - I did however like the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And the Brits were baddies? (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What was up with that? Oh and they kept on saying stuff like &#34;Here come &#39;The Thunderbirds&#39;&#34; - but it was never known as &#39;The Thunderbirds&#39; in the series, why do that?? I&#39;d like to see this re-made in 20 years with more British cast. I preferred the original series. Sorry!

*SPOILERS INCLUDED*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a title like &#34;Bleed&#34;, you know the creative juices weren&#39;t running on high when this puppy was conceived. The movie is your basic run-of-the-mill low-budget slasher movie. Oh sure, it tries to be creative with the premise of the &#34;murder club&#34;, but we learn that was just a joke anyways. Okay, for those who really care about these things, the basic plot is that new girl in town starts dating her co-worker. He invites her into his circle of friends, and at a party, they tell her how they have a &#34;murder club&#34; and they murder people, blah blah blah. Well, we learn that it was all a joke, but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage. Now, the &#34;members&#34; of the Murder Club are being killed one by one. Oh, and the bad guys wins and the movie ends on a downer. By that time, you won&#39;t really care though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, the first 10 or so minutes of this movie make no sense. The motivation for the killings in the beginning of the movie is never explained. I would say that it was a way for the director to pad out the film, but on the DVD there are deleted scenes! I&#39;m not sure why anyone would want to see more than the feature length version of &#34;Bleed&#34;, but apparently the people behind the DVD thought the viewers would be clamoring for more. On the box, it says there are Easter Eggs, but why the hell I would want to waste my time looking for extras on this movie is beyond me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a bad movie, and &#34;Bleed&#34; delivered on that front. It wasn&#39;t a fun bad movie though. Everyone looks good in the movie, and there&#39;s plenty of nudity, but the acting is just awful. My least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer...I think he&#39;s supposed to be funny and amusing, but he just ends up coming off as a tool. I think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage, in a hilariously unconvincing death. Heroine shoves the women into the parking garage cement pole, and the woman looks like she barely hits the thing, and she spits out a mouthful of blood, and &#34;dies&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who think that movie making is an intricate, creative process done by professionals, check out &#34;Bleed&#34;. It will change your mind, and you&#39;ll realize any hack get can a movie made. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, don&#39;t waste your time or money on this.

There was absolutely nothing in this film that hadn&#39;t been done better in a hundred other films. It was barely worth the trouble of watching through to the end. Even the bad language sounded tired. Tom McCamus, a very fine actor, was particularly disappointing here.

Sentimental and naive but undeniably affecting, emotional man-helping-man plea, in this case personified as German and French miners forced to be closed off from each other after the Great War thanks to a new border, leading to disillusionment on the German side, as the French are the bosses. But when a fire begins on the French side, the common decency of the German men lead to assistance, safety and even friendship. This was a plea that would fall on deaf ears within the decade, as a certain man from Pabst&#39;s own side would break that piece and turn the Great War into merely a prelude. But it is obvious to me that Pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental humanism, as this film radiates with this optimism whereas his more flippant, cynical adaptation of The Threepenny Opera lacked the bite needed to make that work work. Also furthering his honest belief are the fact that the characters here are not simplistic mouthpieces for positions, but real people, with real families whose home lives we are privy to as well. These are ordinary, working-class men who just happen to believe in the worth of caring and treating right your fellow man, and in this day of individualist opportunism, I&#39;ll take a little thinning in my plot to get a positive message that represents a point of view that I think we can all aspire to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: Apparently the ending is cut on most prints, where the French rebuild the mining gate, closing off the men once again. This is a brutal turn of events, and may have made the film a better overall film, but I would have lamented it souring the positives vibes of the final sequence, so in short, I&#39;m glad it was clipped.) {Grade: 8/10 (B) / #7 (of 11) of 1931}

Now, I love bad, old skifee movies as much as most people. And I understand that a budget is a budget. That said, Planet of the Dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie can get. The thing has no actors, and only one attractive female whom they kill off two minutes after swimming ashore. There are literally no redeeming qualities to be found in this pile of wasted celluloid. The only thing not wasted was paper...the screenplay must have been no more than four pages long. Surely no one actually WROTE dialogue this pointless. I&#39;m constantly amazed that such movies ever got made, much less released. I&#39;m only glad I didn&#39;t pay to see this waste of time. It&#39;s 75 minutes of my life I&#39;ll never get back.

Imagine, its, say 12-1am - your at home, your bored, your not tired. This scenario occurred about, say 4 or so years back..I turned on the TV and flicked over a few channels and found that this film was on. OH MY WORD this is the worst film I have ever seen! A runaway car that cant be stopped (cos the brakes have been cut or something) in caning it down the freeway - whats gonna happen?! This film was so bad its actually funny - I think the stunts cost about $2 to make, there was one instance where a baby/small child is being winched from the car by a helicopter - in an attempt to excite the viewer - a conveniently placed bridge is nearing ahead...THIS IS THE BEST BAD BIT OF A FILM EVER - it shows the child narrowly missing the bridge but it looks so bad - you can almost see the make of the dummy that they used - total low budget classic! Cant remember the end of the film, though but I bet it was GREAT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt they will ever show this film again so I&#39;m glad I got to see this piece of trash!

I absolutely loved this movie. I bought it as soon as I could find a copy of it. This movie had so much emotion, and felt so real, I could really sympathize with the characters. Every time I watch it, the ending makes me cry. I can really identify with Busy Phillip&#39;s character, and how I would feel if the same thing had happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that all high schools should show this movie, maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing. I recommend this movie to everybody and anybody. Especially those who have been affected by any school shooting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly is one of the greatest movies of all time.

The first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters. however all of a sudden everything was happening too quick, a lame reason for Akshey Kumar to date 3 girls, very loud over acting by both Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the highlight of the movie, Paresh Rawal did well but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri. overall this movie was the biggest disappointment the film does no justice to its trailer. save your money and don&#39;t watch this movie, watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;summarising it: a cheap stage show performance and appearance to the film no story or substance, the plot was extraordinarily non-sense good music by Preetam the man who bought us Dhoom! keep it up! movie shot all in one room, new comers (female cast) were okay as it was their first film but established actors like Akshey and John totally disappointed an established director like Priyadarshan gives his worst movie ever!

I&#39;m a big fan of camp, but when every plot &#39;twist&#39; is predictable and bad, while obviously not trying to be, even I lose interest. I was going to rate this a 3, but the ending dropped it a point easily. Its only saving grace is that I hated other movies more. Not enough beer in the world for this one.

This movie kind of reminds me of A Mary-Kate and Ashley movie-only worse. Just the rich sisters kind of thing I think even though Alysons more the actress, in this movie Amanda michalka was okay sometimes but Alysons acting stunk. i think that after high-school musical they needed to come up with somethihng better and this definitely wasn&#39;t it. The story line wasn&#39;t that great and I think they should have gotten two other people to play Taylor and Courtney. I&#39;m not a big Alyson Michalka fan and this movie didn&#39;t make me like her any better. i think they should definitely sick to singing and only watch this movie if you have nothing better to do (which sadly I didn&#39;t)

This movie is one of my all-time favorites. I think that Sean Penn did a great job acting. It is one of the few true stories that made it to film that I really like. It is in my top 10 films of all-time. I watch it over and over and never get tired of it. Great movie!

A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background, contained the comment &#34;A woman&#39;s life is no more valuable than a man&#39;s&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show. Societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population, sometimes with astonishing speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed. In South America&#39;s War of the Triple Alliance (1865), Paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No society, however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight. Israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its Defense Forces despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;G.I. Jane&#34; is Hollywood fluff.

This movie is just crap, I cant put it differently. Since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story, dialogue, acting, special effects, make-up, pretty much EVERYTHING sucks. I like vampire movies and I know they will never be Oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing, I can&#39;t believe how somebody produced this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not even about vampires, it&#39;s more about a dream/reality experience. The development of the movie is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is... Doesn&#39;t exist, everything seems like a big joke. Maybe that&#39;s what they tried to do, but I sincerely doubt it. I wish I knew what they tried to pull but it just backfired, it&#39;s definitely one of the worst movies I&#39;ve ever seen in my life (and I&#39;ve seen many bad movies, but nothing compared to this) Please, make yourselves a favor and do NOT watch this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It&#39;s also full of clichés! P.S. 2 Bad Script, Bad directing, Bad cinematography. P.S. 3 I bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone.

Hickory Dickory Dock was a good Poirot mystery. I confess I have not read the book, despite being an avid Agatha Christie fan. The adaptation isn&#39;t without its problems, there were times when the humour, and there were valiant attempts to get it right, was a little overdone, and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed. I also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded. However, I loved how Hickory Dickory Dock was filmed, it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant ABC Murders, and it really set the atmosphere, what with the dark camera work and dark lighting. The darker moments were somewhat creepy, this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a Poirot adaptation, maybe not as disturbing as the one in One Two Buckle My Shoe, which gave me nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the essential ingredients, though not as convoluted as Buckle My Shoe,and in some way that is a good thing. The acting was very good, David Suchet is impeccable(I know I can&#39;t use this word forever but I can&#39;t think of a better word to describe his performance in the series) as Poirot, and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly. And the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole, particularly Damian Lewis as Leonard. All in all, solid mystery but doesn&#39;t rank along the best. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox

One should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third Testament, that they had read the other two, or at least knew a little more about them than miracles and Judgement Day. This film contains absolutely nothing of relevance for viewers who are interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy -- there is only the standard British social realism with guttural dialects and plump characters in pubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, good candidates for a real Third Testament have been published several times - like &#34;A Course in Miracles&#34; or &#34;Conversations with God&#34;. They all have thought-provoking new twists and angles for Christian faith and theology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most interesting information in IMDb&#39;s rating is not the number of stars, but how many people who have bothered to vote. In four years, only 387 people have bothered to vote for this film. As usual, the enthusiasts are the most eager. For comparison, have a look at &#34;Jesus Christ, Superstar&#34; - original version from 1973.

This is a superb game for the N64 with superb graphics and a great one-player story-line and even better multi-player game best played with 4 people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The many levels and options for weapons mean that this is one of the best games around for years.

Doppelganger has its moments, but they are few and far between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, this is a grade B blend of pop-psych thriller, ghost story and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who is haunted by the demons of her past (most of her family has been murdered and she was, in at least one case, the prime suspect), or does she just have a really bad case of multiple personality disorder? George Newbern is her new room mate, and most of the action centers on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newbern&#39;s character is pretty sympathetic, and both he and Barrymore do decent work (though not exactly good). The mediocre to (at times) totally horrendous script and the unimpressive directing seem to have combined to sink the rest of the performances into oblivion. Leslie Hope&#39;s character is memorable, but so irritating that you will want to forget her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot eventually disintegrates into a bifurcated (one story arc is psychological realism, the other is supernatural horror) outlandish climax which is so badly conceived, acted and photographed that it effectively counteracts most of what value the film had achieved previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the film has the feel of what might expect to be the result of M. Knight Shamalyan&#39;s first undergraduate film class. The acting and script for the two leads are just good enough to make you care a little about them - at least until the film derails utterly and completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation - send your doppelganger, but avoid a first-person encounter.

This was one of the most boring movies I&#39;ve ever seen I don&#39;t really know why Just your run-of-the-mill stories about guy who is about to get married, and starts to fancy someone else instead. Story has been told a thousand times. Nothing new or innovative about it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t really know what was wrong with this film. Most of the time when these kinds of actors/actresses get together to make a film that have already been made a million times before, it&#39;s really entertaining. There are usually little clever thing in them that aren&#39;t really in any other. For some reason, this one just doesn&#39;t hold your attention. You can pick out some funny parts, or clever ideas in it, but for some reason they&#39;re just not funny, nor clever in any way I wish I new how to explain it, but I don&#39;t Just don&#39;t waste your time on this one

A March 1947 New York Times article described Crossfire as one of the first Hollywood films of the 1940s to &#34;face questions of racial and religious prejudice with more forthright courage than audiences have been accustomed to expect.&#34; While RKO was producing Crossfire, Twentieth Century-Fox was making Gentleman&#39;s Agreement, another story about antisemitism. RKO raced to beat the much &#34;ballyhooed&#34; Fox picture to the theaters, releasing Crossfire several months before Gentleman&#39;s Agreement. In July 1947, RKO screened Crossfire for representatives of various Los Angeles religious groups. In addition, several surveys, which were designed to gauge the audience&#39;s prejudices, were conducted before and after screenings of the film. Crossfire received both praise and criticism for its depiction of antisemitism in America and was the subject of many editorials. Crossfire received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, but lost to Gentleman&#39;s Agreement. It was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan), Best Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame), Best Director and Best Screenplay (Adaptation). In September 1947, Crossfire was named Best Social Film at Cannes. In December 1947, Ebony magazine, an African-American publication, gave the film its annual award for &#34;improving interracial understanding.&#34; Loved this movie. If you get the chance to watch it, see it.

This has to be the funniest stand up comedy I have ever seen. Eddie Izzard is a genius, he picks in Brits, Americans and everyone in between. His style is completely natural and completely hilarious. I doubt that anyone could sit through this and not laugh their a** off. Watch, enjoy, it&#39;s funny.

I&#39;m studying Catalan, and was delighted to find El Mar, a movie with mostly Catalan dialogue, at my art-house video store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm... not so delighted to have seen it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, as other reviewers have said, it&#39;s well-made, and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it&#39;s well-acted and convincing. (For the most part, that is... Would the Mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square, in full view of the dead man&#39;s 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well... minor detail. Up to this point, it had something of the feel of a non-magical Pan&#39;s Labyrinth, also set in the Spanish Civil War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age. Francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both are patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem, as with so many Spanish movies (apologies to Almodovar fans), is that with one exception (Francisca) the characters are just so dang *weird*. Their motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often simply incoherent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s more, it descends into some horrific wretched excess. Be prepared for LOTS of pain and LOTS of blood. The reviewer who called it a &#34;potboiler&#34; is quite on track. If it had been made 40 years ago, the poster would&#39;ve said: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE!! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! BETRAYAL!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable. To work, this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters. As it is, it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between &#34;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&#34; and &#34;Pulp Fiction.&#34; If that sounds like something you&#39;ve got to see, by all means, enjoy. I think I go with something that doesn&#39;t make me feel I need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Catalan, it&#39;s the Mallorqui dialect, fairly different than the Barcelona dialect, though I was surprised by the comment that said that even Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it.

Occasionally funny but generally boring. I did recognize Robert Hegyes from Welcome back Carter (aka Epstein) as the ex-celebrity criminal. There is a knee slapping, gut busting scene with the French lady having a bad reaction to American food. S. Baio, S. Kellerman, and Tom Arnold are billed but have only minor roles. You never get to know the characters and it&#39;s hard to care what happens to them. Not recommended.

Elephants Dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community. And while it was a very interesting idea in concept, in reality it has failed miserably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is beautifully rendered, which is probably the only redeeming factor. A huge problem with them, however, is the vast overruse of light bloom. It&#39;s horrible, although I guess it helps give the film a dreamlike quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is the terrible voice acting. While Proog&#39;s voice actor is at least semi-competent, Emo&#39;s voice actor is HORRIBLE. I guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero, you can&#39;t afford to hire real voice actors. To me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whole, the movie doesn&#39;t really go anywhere. To me it seems like it&#39;s more of a &#34;look what we can do&#34; kind of movie instead of a real film. The plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point. The whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it may be worth a quick download from the official site, but don&#39;t expect anything except pretty graphics.

All the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character Jim being either a bad father, a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish. How can that be funny? Of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed, but Jim&#39;s character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why it that? My guess is that it&#39;s because &#34;he should now better&#34;. Jim&#39;s not a stupid guy, he can take care of things and he&#39;s got the opportunities to do so. But he chooses not to. It&#39;s a conscious choice he makes, when he chooses to not play with his kids, not go shopping because he doesn&#39;t want to buy &#34;lady products&#34; and it&#39;s a choice he makes, when he puts down his relatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other characters seems to only be in the series so Jim can have someone to be a jerk to. If the Cheryl character was a real person, she would have left him years ago, and not stay with the deadbeat for 8 years. But alas, she&#39;s just a catalyst for Jim&#39;s quirky middle-class extreme selfishness.

The Van is a feelgood movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van, in order to seduce them. The only thing this movie doesn&#39;t fail at is precisely depicting the van fad in the US in the late 70s. It looks like it was totally made by amateurs. It&#39;s trash, but I loved it! I have to admit I am a fan of 70s trash! Hope this one makes it to the IMDB bottom 100!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2

Lillian Hellman, one of America&#39;s most famous women playwrights, was a woman with a mission. Her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country. In her memoir, she recounts her trip to the then, Soviet Union, as she was intrigued with the so called successes achieved by that system. &#34;Watch on the Rhine&#34; must have come as a result of those years. The left wing in America, as all over the world had an issue with the rise of fascism, not only in Europe, but in Japan as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Watch on the Rhine&#34; was a play produced on Broadway eight months before the Pearl Harbor attack by the Japanese. In it Ms. Hellman was heralding America&#39;s entrance in World War II. The adaptation is credited to Ms. Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, her long time companion. As directed for the screen by Herman Shumlin, the film was well received when it premiered in 1943.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are introduced to the Muller family, when the film opens. They are crossing the border to the United States from Mexico. They are to continue toward Mrs. Muller&#39;s home in Washington, D.C., where her mother, Fanny Farrelly, is a minor celebrity hostess. The Mullers, we realize are fleeing Europe because of the persecution there against the opponents of the advancing totalitarian regime in Germany. In fact, we thought, in a way, the Mullers could have been better justified if they were Jewish, fleeing from a sure extermination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We find out that Mr. Muller has had a terrible time in his native land, as well as in other places because his outspokenness in denouncing Fascim. Little does he know that he is coming to his mother-in-law&#39;s house that is housing one of the worst exponents of that philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film offers excellent acting all around. It is a curiosity piece because of Bette Davis&#39; supporting role. Paul Lukas, repeating his Broadway role, is quite convincing as Kurt Muller, the upright man that wants to make a better world for himself and his family. Mr. Lukas does a great job portraying Kurt Muller, repeating the role that made him a stage luminary on Broadway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other best performance is by Lucile Watson, who plays Fanny Farrelly, the matriarch of this family. Geraldine Fitzgerald is seen as Marthe de Brancovis, a guest of the Farrellys, married to the contemptible Teck de Brancovis, a Nazi sympathizer, played by George Coulouris. Beulah Bondi, Donald Woods, and the rest of the supporting cast give good performances guided by Mr. Shumlin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film should serve as a reminder about the evils of totalitarian rule, no matter where.

What a dreadful film this is. The only reason you would want to sit through this mess is the pleasurable sight of Miss Eleniak. The painful overacting of Mr McNamara, which became embarrassing at times, ruined what might have been a reasonable film if the correct actors had been cast. Mr McNamara is no Tom Cruise, the actor he obviously wants to be.

Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine, but what gives this neo-noir its juice is Hopper&#39;s creepy, violent character and JT Walsh&#39;s sneakiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A drifter gets mistaken for a hit-man, and tries to make a little dough out of it, but gets in over his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie, when Cage walks into a trailer in Wyoming to get drilling work, with the help of his buddy...and the opening scene in Brokeback Mountain, when the character does the same thing! But that&#39;s another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dennis Hopper is at his best here...cocky, one-step-ahead villainous, seething and explosively violent. JT Walsh (RIP) is also great as the man with a dark past, trying to live legitimately (well, almost).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only 4 real characters of note here, with the exception of the hard-working deputy in the town of Red Rock, Wyoming. The first twist hits early on, and from there it&#39;s a nice neo-noir adventure in some sleepy little town. Satisfying. 8 pts.

I&#39;ve recently seen An zhan. Not because it was a Hong Kong film, but because I was looking for a change from the films being produced here in the US. In my humble opinion, I believe the film could easily compete against the action thrillers being produced here, except for the traditional idiocyncracies of Hong Kong film. The one that still bothers me was the chief inspector character. I still don&#39;t understand why there has to be a complete-idiot-comic-relief-type character even in the serious films that come out of Hong Kong, but I can live with it when the movie is this good. The characters are believable even if the situations they are in are not. The story is fast paced and really sucks you in to it. The real cincher scenes for me were the two bus rides that the thief character takes. Overall, a really solid film.

Well, first off, if you&#39;re checking out Revolt of the Zombies as some very early Night of the Living Dead (1968)-type film, forget it. This is about &#34;zombies&#34; in a more psychological sense, where that term merely denotes someone who is not in control of their will, but who must instead follow the will of another. The &#34;zombies&#34; here, as little as they are in the film, are largely metaphors for subservience to the state or authority in general, as in wartime. It is quite a stretch to call this a horror film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is set during World War I. A &#34;French Cambodian&#34; contingent had heard strange stories about zombification--supposedly Angkor Wat was built by utilizing zombies--and there are tales of zombie armies easily overcoming foes. Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification, but he won&#39;t talk. So Louque and an international military contingent head to Angkor Wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to &#34;wipe out the white race&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the odd things about Revolt of the Zombies is that it seems like maybe writer/director Victor Halperin decided to change his game plan while shooting the script. The film begins as if it will explore the zombie/military metaphor, and maybe even have adventure elements, but after about 15 minutes, it changes gears and becomes more of a love triangle story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halperin does stick with a subtext about will and power (and a Nietzschean &#34;will to power&#34;). The film is interesting on that level, but the script and the editing are very choppy. This is yet another older film for which I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there is missing footage, especially since some scenes even fade or cut while a character is uttering dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amidst the contrived romance story, Halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread, but little of the zombie material makes much sense. Louque discovers the secret of zombification, but it doesn&#39;t mean much to the viewer. The mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusingHalperin even resorts to using superimposed footage of Bela Lugosi&#39;s googly-eyes from his 1932 film, White Zombie, but never explains what it has to do with anything. There are big gaps in the plot, including the love story. Promising, interesting characters from early reels disappear for long periods of time. One potential villain is disposed of unceremoniously before he gets to do much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re a big fan of old, creaky B movies, Revolt of the Zombies may be worth watching at least once--the acting isn&#39;t all that bad, and if you&#39;ve got a good imagination, you can piece together an interesting story in your mind to fill in all of the gaps. But this is the second time I&#39;ve seen the film, with the first only being about five years ago, and I could barely recall anything about it--so it&#39;s not exactly memorable.

My 2nd favorite film of 1970 (after Five Easy Pieces) was totally dismissed by a lot of idiots, calling in an audience-baiting piece of trash. Peter Boyle, a well-known liberal, is incredible as the hard-assed working stiff who has a few problems with the younger generation. He&#39;s a frightening dude, but has a great imagination and is very funny. I was a teenage liberal when this was released, but as horrifying as Joe seemed to me, he also cracked me up! Susan Sarandon, in her first role, is perfect and a mixed-up stone rich fox. The dinner scene in Queens is hilarious and insightful for everybody involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This WAS NOT an exploitation film and the script (which was Oscar-nominated) should have won that year. The director just didn&#39;t WASTE enough money making it to give it enough credibility in Hollywood. No matter your political pursuasion, then and now, you&#39;ll like somebody in this film. A definite 9 out of 10. It&#39;s on DVD and video. Check it out!

On the eighth day God created Georges. But the same as an eighth day doesn&#39;t fit into the week, Georges doesn&#39;t fit into the modern world: He has Down syndrome and is therefore marginalized by society, shunted off to an asylum after his mother&#39;s death four years ago. She was the only one who loved him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry is another man that isn&#39;t loved anymore. His wife has left him, for reasons that she is unable to explain. He loses the love of his daughters, too, when he arrives too late at the railway station to collect the two kids, who wanted to spend the weekend with their father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry is a highly ranked businessman. He knows all the rules that enable us to succeed in our modern meritocracy. But he has entered a state of crisis, which reaches a climax after the loss of the love of his daughters. He questions the sense of his life, without obtaining any definite results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry and Georges meet. At first Harry tries to get rid of Georges, the same as all the others do. But Georges can&#39;t be shaken off. And it gradually dawns on Harry, how much he needs Georges, if he wants to get over his identity crisis. It is Georges who opens a new access to the world for him and who makes him view his life with different eyes. Friendship and human warmth take the place of calculating striving for success. It is no surprise that Harry now cannot avoid failing in his job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georges helps Harry to regain the recognition of the daughters. Even his wife has to admit that the fireworks which he organized were worth seeing. Nonetheless a reintegration into the old life is no longer possible. And the new one turns out to be nothing more than a dream with a time limit, which unstoppably will reach its end. The camera watches Harry and Georges from above, for one long minute, as they are both lying down in the grass, just savoring the moment. But the same as this minute will unavoidably go by, the friendship of the two men, which came into being in such a wondrous fashion, will not be long-lasting. Georges is destroyed by the impossibility of love to the opposite sex and can see no other way out but to commit suicide. Harry turns into a city tramp, who asks the car drivers that are waiting in front of the traffic lights for charity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie describes modern meritocracy as a disastrous mechanism which devours positive values such as human warmheartedness or friendship. It is Georges, the mongol, who seems to be capable of showing the way out of the dilemma, but unfortunately his plea comes to a bad end. However, his failure does not necessarily have to mean that it is impossible or not desirable to reach the aspired goal. The way he shows us is surely passable, although it requires a huge amount of willpower and, above all, the courage to apply a radical nonconformism.

This anime seriously rocked my socks. When the anime first opened itself, I felt it was too slow; the story wasn&#39;t quite moving forward, and Shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead. Once he learns more about tracing, and you learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail War itself, the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together. It was fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop, in the real world. There wasn&#39;t any stupid completely obvious things going on; the development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to watch, but I think the way Shirou and Saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on. A few of the &#34;surprise&#34; people that show up (Gilgamesh?) seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another, meaning we didn&#39;t have &#34;Generic Bad-ass A&#34; being replaced by &#34;Generic Bad-ass B&#34; as soon as A died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anddd, I loved the music. The opening music rocked, and the finishing theme from the final episode just...Seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more. Good job, Type-MOON!

Like most, I thought &#39;another crocodile movie&#39;. So far we&#39;ve had Primeval and Rogue in the last 12 months, what can they do that&#39;s new? Where both those films were about action and violence, this one&#39;s about fear and tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performances aren&#39;t Oscar-worthy when there&#39;s nothing going on, but in times of distress or terror, these people suffer so much it&#39;s like torture. There are holes in the plot and maybe crocs don&#39;t really behave like this as others have pointed out, but the fear is so effective it&#39;s a stretch to say you&#39;ll enjoy this movie. It&#39;ll leave you feeling as uncomfortable as The Passion of the Christ.

Well, I&#39;ve read the book first and thought: wow would this be cool to see in a movie, than I started searching and found there was already a movie made of it... I bought the movie a week ago on DVD and watched it.. they did it awfully wrong! at first this kid Hapi,who isn&#39;t any character in the book, then the mix between the two books (&#39;the river god&#39; and &#39;the seventh scroll&#39;) than Nicolas needing funds while in the book he himself is actually the funder, the whole thing about the Hyksos is wrong also.. Taila is supposed to have invented the lightweight-chariot.. the whole thing about the tomb is also very wrong.. there is supposed to be a channel that has some kind of vacuum-suction around it.. the tomb itself was made in a maze with only a possibility to pass if one knows the rules of the ancient boa-game. There was nothing in the movie about Nicolas being English and Royan was a Coptic-Christian in the book, not a Muslim..This list is endless.. There were only a few things good about the movie, the actors which played Royan, Nahood, Taita, Boris, Mick and Tessay were well-chosen, the rest were just parodies of the characters in the book, Rasfer was the worst, it didn&#39;t get even close to the character that was in my head while I wrote the book.. It is such a shame that such a great book is mutilated in such a bad reproduction... I wonder why Wilbur Smith ever gave his permission for this..

I watched this on tv in 1989 and regretted not taping it. I was very intriguing and suspenseful. It is amazing as the events unfold and this man&#39;s past catches up with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is first rate and the story is exactly what the title claims... &#34;twist of fate&#34;... but no one could run away from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie.

I&#39;m not in favor of death penalties but in this movie, it couldn&#39;t happen fast enough. Just to end the movie. I don&#39;t understand why this movie is rated as high as it is. It fooled me into a bad night.

What an extraordinary crime thriller!! My wife and I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival. It&#39;s already my second favourite film of all-time after DR. STRANGELOVE and I was definitely on an emotional high as I walked home and discussed the film with my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions. A synopsis that I&#39;d feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke, are planning to rob a jewellery store in Westchester, New York. The film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time (before, during and after the robbery), and one key scene is repeated at least three times. Ordinarily, that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece. The excitement, the tension, and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed. By the end, I was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up. I know that I&#39;ve used a few clichés in this post, but I literally was on the edge of my seat. I should mention that the non-linear storyline is quite easy to follow. This isn&#39;t the sort of movie where you&#39;ll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is absolutely brilliant all-around, and I doubt I would have the same admiration for the film if the casting hadn&#39;t been so perfect. A tiny complaint is that Hoffman and Hawke don&#39;t look like brothers, but that&#39;s a minor quibble that I can easily overlook. Hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with Hawke were positively electric. Marisa Tomei (as Hoffman&#39;s wife) and Albert Finney (as the father of Hoffman &amp; Hawke) are also very good in supporting roles. Even some cameo performances were so impressive that I can still remember every remark, gesture and facial expression by Brian O&#39;Byrne and Michael Shannon  absolute perfection. The robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene I&#39;ve ever watched, and I had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes, especially the ones with Hoffman. The music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie, often the same notes played over very effectively. I had the music playing in my head the following day, even as I sat through other films. In addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph, there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable (major spoiler, so I can&#39;t describe the scene). Otherwise, this film is pretty darn close to perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were about a dozen great films at the festival that I would enjoy watching a second time but BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU&#39;RE DEAD stands in a league of its own. As an aside, the director Sidney Lumet spoke before the film and he introduced Marisa Tomei and Ethan Hawke onto the stage. Tomei didn&#39;t speak and she acted a bit shy so Lumet asked &#34;Can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera-shy?&#34; That comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene!!

What I love about this show is that it follows the lives of modern witches and it&#39;s a blast to experience their everyday love, humor and adventure. The literature of magic is so diverse, portraying the ideas of classical, medieval and modern wizardry, like Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina the Teenage Witch, this show is so fun and unique because it lets us experience a lot of that modern wizardry, seven seasons worth! This show has so many great qualities and it&#39;s a joy to watch Sabrina live her daily life in the mortal and &#34;other&#34; realm. I would recommend this to any family because the television series is clean, funny and adventurous. Classic!

These were two video shot movies that Troama decided were horrible so in a desperate move turned into this one movie. Perhaps the bitterness on Troama&#39;s side helped spark the comedy, but for whatever reason this is very funny stuff with an inspired bit with &#34;Oliver Stone&#34; doing commentary during the movie. Lots of cameos, lots of use of the Lesbian Cannibal HoeDown song add to the fun. Trey Parker, Ted Raimi, Julie Strain etc etc....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best of recent Troama releases. Yes it&#39;s all over the place, know that going in, the production quality, or lack of, becomes one of the many running jokes. Go with it and you&#39;ll be in for a good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The behind the scenes, frequently the best things about Troama releases are also above average this time around. I really think the anger they felt over these two lousy films helped drive them to, well not greatness, but drove them to &#34;fix&#34; this film in a way that&#39;s better than either of the films would have been as they were originally planned.

The name &#34;Lucio Fulci&#34; congers up images of graphic death and mutilation in the minds of may fans. Thanks to movies like &#34;Zombi 2&#34;, &#34;City of the Living Dead&#34;, &#34;The Beyond&#34; and &#34;The New York Ripper&#34;, Fulci has a reputation for being one of the goriest directors in history. And although many of his later movies certainly justify his reputation until the release of &#34;Zombi 2&#34; in 1979 Fulci&#39;s films did not contain anywhere near the amount of blood and guts he&#39;s know for, in fact they were for the most part gore free, instead relying on more traditional shocks and disturbing imagery to work. &#34;Don&#39;t Torture a Duckling&#34; hardly contains any gore, yet ranks as his best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Don&#39;t Torture a Duckling&#34; is set in a small Sicilian town where superstition rules instead of logic. The townsfolk are very distrustful of outsiders as well as anyone different, often shunning them. After a series of child murders though many people descend upon the town, including Andrea Martelli (Thomas Milan) who tries to uncover the truth about the murders while they continue to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a remarkable film. It&#39;s very well made with an excellent cast filled with many favorites of Italian exploitation cinema. It also contains a solid score as well as many creative camera movement courtesy or Lucio Fulci. But the real draw of &#34;Don&#39;t Torture a Duckling&#34; is the disturbing nature of the movie. Little kids, around twelve years old are shown mocking retarded people, visiting prostitutes and being propositioned sex by an older woman. It also contains some very biting commentary on the middle class and the Catholic Church. It is for reasons like this that &#34;Don&#39;t Torture a Duckling&#34; was blacklisted throughout Europe when it was first released and never was shown in the United States. Still, &#34;Don&#39;t Torture a Duckling&#34; stands as a monumental achievement in giallo cinema as well as Lucio Fulci&#39;s best work. I really can&#39;t recommend this one enough, check it out.

I&#39;ve been looking forward to watching &#34;Wirey Spindell&#34; since having happened across Schaffer&#39;s &#34;Fall&#34;. Unfortunately, I found &#34;WS&#34; to be a wandering, unengaging, boring bunch of claptrap pieced together with, what apparently is Schaeffer&#39;s signature, a mix of story, narration, and poetry. The film recounts the sexual and other experiences of a Manhattan man about to be married through self-narrated flashbacks. Like beads on a string, Schaffer apparently has strung together every little sexual life experience, while neglecting to tend to the beauty of the necklace. The result is a disjointed rambling story about a boy growing up which fails to engender empathy and leaves the viewer disconnected, unsatisfied, and with a bad after taste which taints the mechanical feel-good ending. A mediocre indie and a step backward for Schaeffer.

Solino really moved me with its deeply drawn characters. While being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers, it was not simply about hate or jealousy. What I liked most about the movie was how I could identify with the feelings Gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in Italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into. To see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was so brave. And as in real life, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo, the brother, who while being the more self assured and elder brother, had so many insecurities. A really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry.

&#34;Creep&#34; is a new horror film that, without a doubt, will please many genre fans simply because it&#39;s so down to the point and unscrupulous! It has many genuine shock-moments, a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension. What it hasn&#39;t got is logic and a solid plot but, to tell you the truth, that didn&#39;t bother me for one second. When the end-credits start to roll, there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director/writer Christopher Smith (in his debut) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long, soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the &#34;creep&#34; in the London subway. The story revolves on the young and haughty Kate, who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor George Clooney who&#39;s in town to present his new film. She falls asleep in the subway, misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network. Things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and kills/kidnaps people to experiment upon. Even experienced homeless people, security guards or sewer-workers can&#39;t rescue her from this ravenous monster! I really dug the creep-character! He&#39;s nauseating, hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating. Christopher Smith only leaves us clues and hints, and it&#39;s merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature&#39;s origin and background. I reckon this isn&#39;t very original, and I&#39;m sure many people won&#39;t appreciate the lack of content, but I forgive Smith and I think it&#39;s better this way than going over the top completely, &#34;Jeepers Creepers&#34;-style (that particular film started out great as well, but as soon as the Creeper&#39;s identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort). The obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore! There&#39;s some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up, as well as the sound effects, are very convincing. The ominous setting of the abandoned London subway during night is effectively used. There also is some acting-talent present in this film, with Franka Potenta (Run Lola Run) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool German film &#34;Anatomie&#34;. Creep is terrific entertainment when you&#39;re in an undemanding mood and Christopher Smith definitely is a director I&#39;ll keep an eye on. Make sure you don&#39;t have to take the subway right after watching this film...

MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time. You know that the characters after finding out that the so-called &#34;Gift From God&#34; was actually a loan, will pay back the money and that everyone will be happy at the end, but how they get there is not as obvious. The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going. The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip. Frank Gorshin, Shirley Jones, and Cloris Leachman prove that they are capable of more than playing the Riddler, Mother Partridge, or Mary&#39;s friend Phyllis while Jill Eikenberry and Wendie Malick play characters different than we have seen on their TV series. Ursula Burton&#39;s portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church. If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of &#34;The Way You Look Tonight&#34;), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try. I don&#39;t think you will be disappointed.

&#34;Winchester &#39;73&#34; marked the first of a series of westerns involving James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. As in most of them Stewart&#39;s hero has an violent edge that threatens to explode at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The title refers to a &#34;one in a thousand&#34; rifle that is up for competition at a rifle shoot held in Dodge City on July 4, 1876. Into town comes Lin McAdam (Stewart) and his sidekick High Spade (Millard Mitchell) who are on the trail of Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) for a past dastardly deed. They arrive just in time to see Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) running saloon girl Lola (Shelley Winters) out of town. It turns out that Dutch Henry is also in town for the rifle shoot. Lin and Dutch Henry shoot it out for the coveted prize with Lin winning but Dutch Henry robs Lin of the gun and escapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lin and High Spade trail Dutch Henry across country where they encounter Lola with her cowardly beau Steve Miller (Charles Drake) hold up in a U.S. Cavalry camp awaiting attack by the Indians led by Young Bull (Rock Hudson) who has acquired the prized rifle by murdering wily gun runner John McIntyre. He had got the weapon by cheating Dutch Henry at poker. Young Bull is killed during the attack and the gun passes to Steve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Lola and Steve meet up with notorious gunman Waco Johnny Dean (Dan Duryea) who kills Steve and takes the valued rifle and Lola for himself. When Dean meets up with Dutch Henry, he allows him to take back &#34;his gun&#34; planning to murder him later. In the town of Tuscosa, Lin kills Dean as Dutch Henry&#39;s plans of holding up the bank go bad and he escapes into the hills with Lin in pursuit. In one of the best final shoot outs ever, the two meet in the final showdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I believe that this movie was the only one of the Stewart/Mann collaborations that was shot in B&amp;W. It is beautifully photographed, especially the scenes in the &#34;wide open spaces&#34; and in particular, the final showdown. Stewart playing against type, plays the hero with a violent revenge motive edge, an emotion that he would carry into future films with Mann.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As in most Universal westerns, this one boasts a cast of seasoned veterans and contract players of the day. In addition to those mentioned above, J.C. Flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as various henchmen, Ray Teal as the sheriff pursuing Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as rookie soldiers and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles in the Dodge City sequence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A classic western in every sense of the word. It was responsible for re-generating Stewart&#39;s career as an action star.

Less a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH should not be really be compared with such Hitchcock masterpieces as VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW, or PSYCHO; it is instead more akin to such enjoyable romps as TO CATCH A THIEF and NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Shot largely on location in Morocco and London, the film tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently run afoul of an assassination plot--and when their young son is kidnapped in order to insure their silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Stewart and Doris Day are quite effective in their roles of the All-American couple, and the characters are given an unusual twist: Stewart, a midwestern doctor, is outgoing but has a touch of &#34;the ugly American abroad&#34; about his personality; Day, who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired upon her marriage, has a suspicious nature. These qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH contains a number of famous scenes; both the scene in which Stewart drugs Day before telling her of the kidnapping and the very complex Albert Hall sequence, involving what seems hundreds of cuts, are very powerful. Less often noticed, although to my mind equally if not more satisfactory, are the more subtle scenes in which Hitchcock combines an edge of suspense along with perverse humor, as when Stewart attempts some detecting at a taxidermist shop and Day belts out &#34;Que Sera, Sera&#34; (written for this film) in a most unsuitable way at an embassy cocktail party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH lacks the depth and impact of Hitchcock&#39;s greater work, it remains an enjoyable film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole. It&#39;s Hitchcock-light, but recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer

Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts. In so many ways, the show is much like the film THE ENEMY BELOW--where the American Captain (Robert Mitchum) and the German Captain (Curt Jurgens) are shown in counter-point as they both try to outwit the other--and in the process develop a grudging respect for their foe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly enough, only a short bit of the beginning of the episode takes place on a planet--and this is amazing because an episode on board ship could easily have been static and dull. But, because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters written and acted so well (Shatner and Mark Leonard as the Romulan leader). Oddly, for the die-hard Trekkers out there, they&#39;ll recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played Spock&#39;s father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is this is simply a great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

This movie is a must-see movie for all. Congress should see this truthful documentary from the point-of-view of the soldier, as should everyone in America. The previous reviewer totally missed the point--the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are NOT terrorists, but who just live in our &#34;enemy&#39;s&#34; territory, and what it does to the soldiers. We must support our troops by bringing them home IMMEDIATELY, before another person is killed or injured. This also reveals that the government does not help its veterans, those who are injured mentally, with ptsd- post-traumatic stress disorder, or physically, with lost limbs. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL

&#34;I like cheap perfume better; it doesn&#39;t last as long...&#34; - Ralph Meeker&#39;s convict character (Lawson) tells this to Barbara Stanwyck&#39;s Helen character, after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out w/her husband in Tijuana...! This line cracked me up, and also seemed like a metaphor for this film - that cheap is better than expensive, because a cheap perfume-loving man who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run! I agree with some of the other comments posted about Helen&#39;s attraction to Lawson. Even though her narration states that she wants Lawson to be put away, she did seem attracted to his fiery nature, and that passion he stirred up in her wouldn&#39;t likely wash away with the tide!

It&#39;s a bad season for Bollywood with all the big releases with a massive hype surrounding proving to be duds at the box office. London Dreams is no exception to that. Let&#39;s dissect it... It&#39;s all about chasing your dreams and how far will you go to achieve it. Sounds impressive right? But unfortunately the film is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to make it big someday. His dream is to perform in Wembley stadium in front of a cheering 90,000 audience calling out his name. He is joined by two brothers, Zoheb &amp; Wasim (debutants Aditya Roy &amp; Ranvijay) and a ravishing Priya (Asin). Together they form &#34;London Dreams&#34; their dream band. After impressing the chief of a record company, they become overnight sensations. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya which he doesn&#39;t want to reveal till he achieves his goal. Arjun then brings his childhood friend Manjit Khosla aka Mannu (Salman Khan), a carefree flirtatious guy who has got no ambitions in life, to join their band. Mannu is a trained musician and a real talent for whom later Arjun become envious for Mannu&#39;s superior skills and his affair with Priya. Arjun with the help of Zoheb plans to blight Mannu. What happens next forms the rest of the movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming to the technical aspects, we feel only the shadow of Vipul Amritlal Sha whom we have admired in Namaste London. Felt like he simply visualized the screenplay. To cut it short, a glorified cameraman. Screenplay by Suresh Nair dulls even though it has its moments. Defined in a predictable fashion, the screenplay bore you to stiff. Camera work was awesome in capturing the beauty of London. It&#39;s the only entertaining part while watching songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few songs are hummable while others are passable noisy fare. Ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character. Salman is monotonous and he irks you. Asin is forgettable and I don&#39;t that she will make it big in Bollywood. Aditya Roy is impressive while Ranvijay is strictly OK. Brinda as the bitch is what we have seen in innumerable movies. Ompuri is ongoing with the proceedings. I don&#39;t want to pen down about the flaws as it will be a herculean task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally let me put it simple and straight, London Dreams is a soulless movie which you may better enjoy on DVD.

Beyond the Clouds is in many ways the weirdest film I have ever seen. Not for its Cult appeal, gore, or even for its ideas, but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema. Beyond the Clouds was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, one of Italy&#39;s most famous directors. However, if you gave this film only a quick watch-over, passively I mean, it would seem one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances. This movie deserves great attention, to the point of embracing all its cheese. By cheese I don&#39;t mean a slice, but a whole brick of cheddar! The music seems like it&#39;s from some Italian porno, the story and dialogue like they are from a corny Japanese soap, and the metaphors are so obvious you want to smack yourself on the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once you get passed all this, you are engaged in an existential work of art. The cheese feeds into the subtle filming and draws our attention, perfectly, to what needs to be known. The basic plot is of four chapters, unrelated, and all about love. What we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said, people cannot communicate to each other. Instead they can only communicate through each other. I suppose that&#39;s why the dialogue and plot is so cheesy, because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of causality and people&#39;s reaction overly melodramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left that film thinking to myself; maybe all life is one big melodrama. We judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful. I hate, because I have reason. But what does the hated think? Maybe they think that my hate is stupid and arbitrary. In other words, melodramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So melodrama is actually an existential function. A corny romance is simply human interaction put under a magnifying glass, allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great film, I recommend it to all!

Peter O&#39;Toole gives a brilliant performance in this movie. I have seen the original version with Robert Donat and I much prefer Peter O&#39;Toole&#39;s performance and the movie in general even though it is a musical. I&#39;ve really never seen anything that Mr. O&#39;Toole is in that I don&#39;t like. He is a brilliant actor, multi-talented, giving performances full of passion and depth. Petula Clark also gave a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the part. It is an all-around heartwarming movie, full of tenderness and bittersweet fun. I will always remember (in para-phrase) the line where Mr. Chips regrets he has never given her children, and she replies, &#34;Of course you have, hundreds of them -- all boys.&#34; Thank you for the opportunity to vote for this movie and to voice my opinion.

Steven Seagal, Mr. Personality himself, this time is the United States&#39; greatest Stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military(..who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base, later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station)if he is able to successfully infiltrate a Northern Afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called Black Sunday, who have commandeered an Air Force stealth fighter thanks to an American traitor. Along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor, Jannick(Mark Bazeley), John Sands(Seagal)will fly into enemy territory, receiving help from his Arab lover, Jessica(Ciera Payton)and a freedom fighter, Rojar(Alki David) once they are on ground. Jannick is kidnapped by Black Sunday leaders, Stone(Vincenzo Nicoli)and his female enforcer, Eliana(Katie Jones), and Sands must figure out how to not only re-take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter, but rescue him as well. And, maybe, Sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained, Rather(Steve Toussaint)in the process. Sands has 72 hours until a General&#39;s Navy pilots bomb the entire area. On board the stealth, Black Sunday equipped a biochemical bomb, hoping to detonate it on the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seagal gets a chance to shoot Afghans when he isn&#39;t slicing their throats with knives. The film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead. The setting of Afghanistan doesn&#39;t hold up to scrutiny(..nor does how easily Seagal and co. are able to move about the area undetected so easily) and the plot itself is nothing to write home about. The movie is edited fast, the camera a bit too jerky. Seagal isn&#39;t as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes, unlike the good old days. One of Seagal&#39;s poorest efforts, and he&#39;s as understated as ever(..not a compliment). Even more disappointing is the fact that Seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film&#39;s chief villains, tis a shame. He doesn&#39;t even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way(..sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around, but it&#39;s not as clear a picture as I enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying close-ups).

It&#39;s not really about gymnastics; swap out the occasional training montages and it could just as easily be about archery, or microbiology, or a booger-flicking tournament. Instead, like every other Rocky/Flashdance derivative that flooded the 80s market, it&#39;s about conquering adversity with stick-to-it-iveness, rendering all social/personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome - with love interest standing by of course. Ronald Reagan top to bottom, in short; so as a piece of cinema it&#39;s down to the details. Some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up - especially the love interest, brought to you by none other than Mr. Keanu Reeves, warming up for Ted; heroine Olivia D&#39;Abo&#39;s hateful alkie dad and big-hair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitch-nemeses/teammates, one of whom appears to be made of porcelain. It&#39;s my instinct to be appalled by the comic-relief black guys, but on the other hand at least they&#39;re in the movie. But D&#39;Abo doesn&#39;t quite convince with her awkward-girl shtick, and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the gymnastics themselves really does matter; it&#39;s all just bodies hurtling around, and not only is the outcome of the big tournament a foregone conclusion, it&#39;s all performed by an obvious double.

When I saw this movie I was stunned by what a great movie it was. This is the only movie I think I would ever give a 10 star rating. I am sure this movie will always be in my top 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is superb. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are at their best. I don&#39;t think anyone could have a better job than Kate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is a rainy day and you can&#39;t decide what to rent, well, this is the one. You will love all the acting, special effects, and much much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now!!! You won&#39;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I&#39;d say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It&#39;s everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I&#39;d recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside. Fortunately, the period from about 0-30 and 1:00-2:19 (The End) is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of excellent performances in this film, and an equal number of terrible ones. Just like everything else in this movie the acting is either perfect or terrible. Peter Ustinov as the slimy one-eyed slave Kaptah is perfect. It is one of his best performances, up there with his role in Spartacus. Victor Mature as the ambitious Horemheb is also perfect. Again, one of his best roles. Jean Simmons is wasted as Merit, the perfect girl in love with our hero John Carradine gives a nice supporting role as a philosophical grave robber; and Michael Wilding is excellent as Akhnaton, the idealistic pharaoh who tries to bring peace and monotheism to Egypt only to see it fall apart due to his unwillingness to fight. Now for the bad. Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe is sadly miscast. This is doubly unfortunate as he is the main character. The entire film revolves around him. He actually does rather good as the disillusioned exile and the wise old man. This is because of his sorely limited range. He doesn&#39;t seem able to put any passion into his words. This is especially apparent during the love scenes which are beyond awkward. He spends the last half of the film as an old man, a performance at which he is decent enough at. He does have the perfect voice for the character. The less said about Bella Darvi as Nefer, the treacherous Babylonian woman, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The costuming and sets are magnificent. This is the only film that I know of that attempts to depict life in Egypt that isn&#39;t overshadowed by Jews or Romans. The film takes place in the 14th Century B.C. which is before even Exodus. The only monotheists are the pharaoh Akhenaten and his followers. There is the same strong element of religious zeal that can be found in most epics, but it is done differently and it only shows up at the very end. An interesting note: by having Akhenaten followed by Horemheb as pharaoh, the film completely skips over the most famous pharaoh of all: Tutankhamen. Seems kind of a strange thing to do when using that name could increase awareness of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned: this is a 1950s epic film. If you don&#39;t like that type of thing then don&#39;t expect this one to be different. It is different, but it is still an epic. I appreciate this film, and I appreciate what it did and what it tried to do. This is a film that should be better remembered than it is.

Pretentious claptrap, updating Herman Melville (!), about a young man&#39;s vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother getting transferred to his long-lost sister who has been raised by gypsies. Or something like that  not that anyone really cares to unravel its multi-layered plot decked out with pornographic sex scenes, pseudo-symbolic imagery (the siblings swimming in a river of blood) and other bizarre touches (a gypsy child repeatedly insults passers-by in the street until she is anonymously beaten to death, the deafening music of a rock group utilized in the demolition of old buildings). Considering the source material and the presence of Catherine Deneuve (who at least gets to bathe in the nude), I was expecting a lot more from this one; apparently, there&#39;s an even longer TV version of POLA X out there

&#34;Gargle with old razor blades. Can I help it if I&#39;m not cousin Basil? I think the piano&#39;s out of tune. Ginger Grey. This is your little snookums.&#34; Laughs throughout the entire 20 minute short as the boys spoof gold diggers and opera singers. They even manage to show us how to properly demonstrate to some attractive ladies how to handle both a rifle and a bear trap. Wonder how many times they rehearsed the scene with the phone booth. Adding Christine McIntyre and Emil Sitka, 2 frequent collaborators, to the mix makes it even better. Only Vernon Dent is missing. The Stooges did some great individual scenes, but this was their best overall.

Typical story of an evil kid going after people. I suspect that Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear on &#34;Starsky and Hutch&#34;) and Vincent Schiavelli didn&#39;t want to stress this junk on their resumes (actually, Schiavelli left this life with a mostly good resume). Sometimes I wish that the killers in these movies would just go after the idiots who decide that we need a new one of these movies every other month (note: that comment is not to be taken seriously; I just think that slashers have lost their touch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is one movie that you&#39;ll do best to avoid. It&#39;s ninety minutes to two hours that I&#39;ll never get back.

Well it is a good movie. However, you have to admit that Van Dame&#39;s movies haven&#39;t been so great lately. On the other hand if you are a hardcore van Dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes. Also What i really liked is the music beautiful music. am sure this will kill time if you are action fan. As for Isaac Florentine the director of Undisputed 2, i don&#39;t think he did a good job as he did with Undisputed.I cant wait when one day Van Dame&#39;s movies hit the cinemas before the DVD. Maybe, one day:).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end it worth the watch if you got no other action movies to watch, this could make your hour and half fun.

One of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams, rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins. One of the most serious examples in 19th century USA of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold-bearing gravely hills on the sides of the Sacramento Valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s. This process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside, causing the material to wash downhill, where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment. The sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the Sacramento River or its tributaries. The sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas. Some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields, where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult. Thus, the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by Warner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, we might ask why Warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor Technicolor, a very rare treatment in 1938. A story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldn&#39;t seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time. The answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors, with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations. Then, we might ask why colorless George Brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero, to be paired with Olivia de Havilland. Among other things, this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it. Even the usually colorful Gabby Hayes, in his small role, seemed unusually subdued. Unfortunately, I fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film. The portion I saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems. It needed to be more like &#34;The Good Earth&#34;, released just the year before. Just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man, such as Errol Flynn. Finally, there is the matter of the inane title. Surely, Warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title. &#34;Gold or Grain&#34; is short and to the point. Incidentally, I understand there is still plenty of gold in &#39;them thar hills&#39;, waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining.

Why is impossible to write in french ? Very Kitch! This journey in the center of the earth is despicable technical possibilities nevertheless current in 1976. These big &#34;Casimir&#34; of monsters is completely ridiculous! The film deserve however a &#34;remake&#34;, as was &#34;KING KONG&#34; (the last one), with a little more supplied scenario. The professor has resemblances with the Professor Calculus and is rather funny. David (the character) is enough inconsistent but cross(spend) to the people from below a good message &#34; you unite and will overcome you! &#34; Altogether we would say a film made in the 40s. Now that I said everything (or almost) the evil of which i thought of it, we can say that if we have the brain get tired or anything has to see of the other one, then the thing(matter) is even rather entertaining. Hugh! Such is my opinion! (translating French to English with &#34;Reverso&#34; : sorry for possible mistakes !)

. . . and never, ever see it. Now, I&#39;ve been watching bad scifi movies for years. I love watching bad scifi movies. I think that was the only reason I could watch this movie the whole way through. I was toughened up by &#34;Nukie,&#34; &#34;Indian Superman,&#34; and that awful &#34;Fantastic Four&#34; movie, just to name some examples. Usually, I have to beat my head against the wall after I&#39;ve seen a bad movie to make some of the pain go away. No, not with this one. With &#34;TDB,&#34; I had to hit myself in the head with a shoe in the middle of the movie. Temporary fix. I can&#39;t believe I wanted to see that. I cried. When it finished, I cried. It was horrible. It was worse than when I saw *shudders* Wil Wheaton in his underwear in &#34;The Curse,&#34; which, by the way, never watch either. Aside from the fact that Wesley Crusher&#39;s in his tighty whiteys, it&#39;s just sooo bad. But this review is about &#34;TDB.&#34; The worst part about it is that someone wrote this movie and said, &#34;This deserves to go on film! It&#39;s great!&#34; and Wayne Newton, Rob Lowe, and everyone else in the cast said, &#34;Oh, this is what I want on my film history!&#34; I&#39;ll watch &#34;Indian Superman&#34; until the cows come home, but I am never going to see this steaming pile of dren again.

Interesting and short television movie describes some of the machinations surrounding Jay Leno&#39;s replacing Carson as host of the Tonight Show. Film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding Conan O&#39;Brien and Jay Leno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film does a good job of sparking viewers&#39; interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the stakeholders, particularly of the NBC executives. The portrayal of Ovitz was particularly compelling and interesting, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, many of the characters were only very briefly limned or touched upon, and some of the acting seemed perfunctory. Nevertheless, an interesting story.

OK, yes its bad, yes its complete fluff, yes it makes dobbin the mule look like an Oscar winner but look at it like i did i was 13, special effects were pretty much non exsistant in 90% of films, back in the good Ole days when films needed a story line.. OK so even the storyline is a bit dodgy.. but wow did i get into this film as a kid in the 80s. cheesy rock, bad special effects, but airplanes an aerial fights and it had queens one vision on the soundtrack.. see even the worst things have a silver lining.. all in all if you want a bad film to show a 12 year old who hates computer effects (if there is such a film) this is the ideal choice

This thought long lost flick sometimes comes available on the web. So I bought me a copy. Well, of course the acting is terrible and the story line is childish but it does have his moments. I think people who searched this one also knows the backstory of it. It was made by a grindhouse cinema owner for an extreme low budget. But for me he surely didn&#39;t spoiled the money on props but on the make up. The make up is for that kind of flick well done. The zombies are watchable and the gore is intact. The only problem with that kind of movies is the quality of the pelicule. It&#39;s terrible, luckely no hiss on the sound but sometimes it&#39;s way too dark. So you have to watch clearly to see the gore. In a funny way they tried to sell this one as really not for the squeamish. A voice-over tells in the beginning of the movie to watch out for a sign and a man appearing with green flashes, that tells you there is gore on the way. Of course that doesn&#39;t work, made me think of Cannibal Girls, had that annoying bell when the red stuff started to flow. They had the original idea, Cannibal Girls was made a year earlier. Don&#39;t go for the storyline, go for the zombies and notice a continuity mistake. When the girl and guy are making love first she takes of her bra, then they make love and suddenly her underwear is back on...try to do that, or am I getting a bit offline,...eat it you ugly corpses

The operative rule in the making of this film seems to have been &#34;never make a 1 minute scene when you can make it a 10 minute scene.&#34; This was a principle set right from the start with an interminably long portrayal of the graduation of the Harvard class of 1870. The point of that scene, I suppose, was to introduce some of the primary figures in the story and give a bit of their background - which is somewhat effective when comparing the idealism of the Harvard graduation ceremony to the realism of life in Johnson County, Wyoming, but it just keeps going and going, and that sets the stage for a film that features repeated stretches of mind-numbing nothingness, made even worse by the fact that I found a significant amount of the dialogue to be almost incoherent. In the end, I couldn&#39;t even watch this in one sitting. I got through about half of it and had to set it aside for a couple of days before I could drag myself back to see how it turned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reaction to this movie in many ways is a shame, because there are positives here. The performances are generally of a high calibre, especially from Kris Kristofersson as Averill, Christopher Walken as Champion and Isabelle Huppert as Ella. The basic story - interspersed as it is around that ever-present mind-numbing nothingness - is potentially interesting, focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in Johnson County and a local cattle company&#39;s efforts to stop them by killing a number of them in collaboration with the government and the military. There&#39;s also some absolutely breathtaking scenery shots. Having said that, the whole thing could frankly have been done in half the time - and should have been. In the end, all those potential positives are washed out by - again - the mind-numbing nothingness that the movie seems to revolve around. Seriously - 2/10.

This movie was great the first time I saw it, when it was called &#34;Lost in Translation.&#34; But somehow Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into a cranky Latino woman played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan turned into Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silence we enjoyed in Translation, we get meaningless blabbering in 10 Items that verges on annoying. Instead of characters that were pensive and introspective as in Translation, we get characters that spew pointless advice on topics they have no clue about. How can a character that wears hundred dollar T-shirts and has never been inside a Target department store expect to give advice to a working-class woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? Don&#39;t think that stops him. If he isn&#39;t giving her clothing advice, he&#39;s telling her what she should eat. The most annoying part of the movie for me was how supposedly they were in a hurry to make an appointment, and yet the characters keep finding time to run another errand, be it washing the car, stopping at Arby&#39;s, or just laying around to list off their 10 Items or Less lists of things they love and hate. I kept wanting to yell at them saying, &#34;Didn&#39;t you say you had somewhere to be? What the heck are doing? A minute ago you were practically late, now you&#39;re eating roast beef and pondering your lives!&#34; Until I saw this movie, I never truly understood how something could &#34;insist upon itself,&#34; but I think this movie does exactly that, and undeservedly so. The dialogue makes the characters cheesy and unsympatheticwith the exception that I felt sorry for both of the actors for having signed onto this project.

My first hugely disappointing BBC/Jane Austen flick. The tone is off, the costumes are off, the hair is off, the music is from outer space, and Robert Hardy, bless him, looks like he&#39;s really annoyed to be in such a stinker. Even some of the casting is off. No, I take that back, a good director can make a silk purse out of a sows ear, so to speak. The performances in this thing are so over the top and melodramatic that it&#39;s almost a farce of a Jane Austen story, which is ironic since Northanger Abbey is a sort of homage/send up of the early Gothic novel. I wanted to slap the female lead after awhile; who made the decision that she should be such a ninny? I had to watch Pride &amp; Prejudice (&#39;95) immediately to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Phew!

This entry doesn&#39;t contain a spoiler. It doesn&#39;t have to. The movie is as predictable as the sunrise. The element in the first Alien movies was the suspense that something COULD happen. This was so in the first two Predator movies, though less prevalent. Requiem has totally removed the element of suspense and replaced it with blood and gore. You know people are going to die (well duh, it is a AvsP movie), but you know WHO is going to die and WHEN they are going to die, AND WHERE they are going to die before it happens. The directors should take a lesson from Hitchcock who said, &#34;Suspense is not a time bomb going off under a table. Suspense is a bomb NOT going off under the table&#34;. What&#39;s the sense in going to a movie when you know exactly what is going to happen and when? If you really, really want to watch this movie, wait until it comes out on video and then RENT IT, but by no means would I ever buy it.

Flat out the funniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flick exposes all the clichés, and then some! Excruciatingly bad (Downs-Syndrome!) actors. Terribly heavy self important dialog. Scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat. Jarring editing. Pointless plot points. All wrapped up in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych-drivel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It achieves exactly what it was designed to. A hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust-funders, to show to their parents when they ask them what they&#39;ve been doing for the last two years! After &#34;What Is It?&#34; received its Cannes award, presenter Werner Herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof, in part of his own films! He supposedly blew up at the info. To this day he refuses to discuss the incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, see it and laugh, this will be a classic of humor for many years to come.

Years ago I read the book &#39;A Máquina&#39; (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again, I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text. Also I can&#39;t recall such a powerful performance like Gustavo Falcão&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see and feel how colossal his love for Karina is. You can realize that he&#39;ll move mountains and do anything for this love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do see this movie, watch it thru the eyes of the kid that lives inside you, enchant yourself!

this movie is not as bad as some say it is infact i think it`s more enjoyable than the original . maybe that`s why some people hate it as much cos they dont want to admit it`s a good (not great) movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;most if not all fx were done by C.G.I which i didn`t mind at all cos it was an enjoyable movie. Phil Buckman - (Chris) was in my opinion the best guy in the movie Julie Delpy was rather attractive she brought the sexiness to the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there were a lot of wisecracks in the movie which i thought were good. this movie is in my collection but the original is not because i dont like it as much as this one. i was not bored when i watched this movie it kept me watching unlike some horror movies i could mention like oh say = driller killer &amp; suspiria (dario argento`s movie) thats to name but two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is an ok werewolf film it should be in people`s collection if they like werewolf movies maybe i`ll get the original at some point maybe. i have only one complaint and that is Phil Buckman - (Chris) should have been in it more than he was but apart from that the movie was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rating for this movie 8/10 an ok werewolf movie not the worst one out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80&#39;s movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see. Well, I rented it and I have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as &#34;April Fools Day&#34;, &#34;Friday 13th&#34; and &#34;Prom Night&#34;, this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story. Characters that I found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer. Another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket, he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting, instead, the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste, I was disappointed in his part in the end. As far as the true identity of the killer goes, when the identity was released as to who he was, I just laughed, but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed. This movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but don&#39;t spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory.

It is now clear that the true golden age of American film was from the mid-60s until just before the release of Star Wars. Before then, there was too much Hays Code-constricted pap. With Star Wars, the green light was lit for most films to be directed at children and morons, a practice which continues to this day. THE SEVEN-UPS, truth be told, contains a couple hackneyed lines of dialogue -- &#34;We can do this the easy way, or we can do it the hard way&#34; is one -- but I&#39;m damned if I can find anything else wrong with it. (In fact, that line may not even have been stale when this film was made.) THE SEVEN-UPS demonstrates all that was right with the best films of the golden age: sparse dialogue, realistic acting, real locations (winter in a dirty New York has never looked better/worse), propulsive stories, and, yes, the best car chase ever filmed. Bill Hickman is the driver Scheider is chasing (you will recognize him from Bullitt), and the structure of the chase is fairly similar to the McQueen one, but I prefer Scheider&#39;s facial intensity here, the pacing, the terrific close-ups of the schoolchildren, and the shattering conclusion. (That VW bug going about 2 mph always bothers me in the Bullitt chase.) A stringy, screechy score by Don Ellis sets the perfect mood. THE SEVEN UPS: bleak, grim, action-oriented, grown-up. This is a film that couldn&#39;t be made today; there&#39;s no &#34;gimmick&#34; for the kiddies or preposterous ending. Thank you, Philip D&#39;Antoni, Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco: for as long as cop films are watched, THE SEVEN-UPS and its 1970s brethren (e.g., THE FRENCH CONNECTION), will set the standard.

Listen, I don&#39;t care what anybody says, as Cypher is nothing less than a 5 star movie. Cypher is not, I repeat not, a B movie. Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. Suffice it to say, I am a connoisseur of the world&#39;s finest spy films and this film is nothing less than top flight. I cannot overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is. Cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made. The technology in this movie is over the horizon of spacetime. In fact, I must admit that Cypher completely surprised the hell out of me. In fact, I&#39;ve recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie. Other critics, of whom some downplayed the movie, have no idea as to what the hell they&#39;re talking about. Don&#39;t listen to the haters. And actually, for the most part, reviews of Cypher have been largely positive. And it should be noted that Cyher is not only a good movie, but it is also a fantastic movie. Cypher is the kind of movie that&#39;s so advanced and so magnificently crafted, that it&#39;s over the heads of most critics and all the cynics. There is nothing wrong with or cheap about Cypher whatsoever. Again, the cinematography, the backdrops, the technology, the storyline, and the acting are all 100% world-class top notch. Naturally, I won&#39;t give anything away. This is not a spoiler. And though it is the contention of some critics that Cypher should have been in movie theaters, I believe quite the opposite. Cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for DVD release only and not in a bad way. Cypher has got to be the greatest underground spy flick ever to hit the shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Total Recall, Logan&#39;s Run, Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu... look out! Cypher equally earns the distinction of being placed in the AONN Multimedia Research, 5 Star Eternal Spy Movie Hall of Fame. Cypher is counterespionage at it&#39;s absolute best. Hands down and hats off. Nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction. The future is now.

This is a love story set against the back drop of television news. The three main stars, William Hurt,Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks create a love triangle whilst working at the Washington bureau of a TV network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Grunick(Hurt)is the handsome reporter who is being groomed to be a star.Jane (Hunter)is the producer who recognises that Tom lacks the intellectual gravitas to be a real journalist, but falls for him anyway.Aaron Altman(Brooks)is the man who shares her beliefs in journalistic standards is also the man who truly loves her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly Hunter was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award ,but lost out to Cher(Moonstruck!).She was robbed! This is Hunter&#39;s film.Her character Jane is smart,ruthless and totally driven. She is also hilariously neurotic. Her performance is perfect.Just watch her face when she watches the tape of Tom&#39;s interview of a rape victim. The scales literally fall from her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wiliam Hurt&#39;s performance is less showy.He plays a man who is well aware that he is a himbo and a fraud,but is smart enough to know that his rise will be facilitated by people like Jane.He gives little hints of a man who is extremely calculating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film comments on celebrity, journalism,integrity and the commercial pressures on news in a medium that is focused on the bottom line. It predicted that news would be dumbed down, that standards would slowly be lowered due to commercial pressures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about this:this film was released before the end of the Cold War and before rise of reality TV.Yet, it predicted the dumbing down of the news.Paris Hilton&#39;s release from jail was treated like a major news story! To see how prophetic this film is,just watch your evening news and note the set, the graphics and the presenters.Tom Grunick and his clones are well and truly alive!

THE GOOD: The acting were great especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor instead of Matt Dillon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD: I&#39;m a visible minority (non-white) and I have experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT despite my life experiences and the movie&#39;s subject matter, I would definitely NOT say that this movie is the best of the year, in fact, it&#39;s FAR from it. I have problems with this movie both from a moviegoer&#39;s perspective and from a visible minority&#39;s perspective. Some of my problems with this movie are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Poor character development (or none at all). Just because we saw extremes in a character, for example, Matt Dillon being a racist cop and being a good caregiver to his ailing father, that does not mean in any way that the character is well-developed. Yes, I admit that in a big cast ensemble like in this movie, it is quite difficult for every character to be well-developed, BUT that does not mean that at none of the characters should be like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) The dialogue seems really contrived to the point that I&#39;m really surprised this movie won for Best Original Screenplay. They should show this movie in a screenplay writing class NOT because it&#39;s good but to show students and future screenplay writers what NOT to do. I just felt like I&#39;ve been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is. I get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) The plot seems so coincidental, it is laughable. What are the chances of a black car robber running over an Asian guy who also happens to be a human trafficker while entering his van, and that same black car robber ended up carjacking that Asian guy&#39;s van several hours later after he brought him the hospital, only to find out that the several Asians being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car robber has a good side after all? Or, what about that scene where a prejudiced upper-class white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred vanished into thin air? If it was THAT simple, why don&#39;t we throw every racist in America down the stairs so they will have a change of heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) I think my biggest misgivings about this movie is the unrealistic view of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face. I&#39;ve been refused to enter a supermarket because I&#39;m not white. Did the store owner said because I was not white? No, he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside. Did he yell racial slurs? No. Racism in America is more hidden. Some cab drivers probably won&#39;t stop to pick you up because you&#39;re non-white but that does not mean that they will try to run you over or get out and say racial slurs. If a Chinese woman rear-ended me, I won&#39;t be saying &#34;blake! blake! Learn some English bitch!&#34;. On the other hand, if I was a Chinese woman and I accidentally rear-ended a Mexican woman, I won&#39;t say &#34;Mexicans are bad drivers&#34; in front of her face. That&#39;s not how things work. Instead, I would give out my insurance info, say sorry, and go home and tell my fellow Chinese friends and family that Mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. That is the real racism. It&#39;s hidden and not in your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Crash is not original unlike what some people may say. The interlocking and interweaving story lines, plots, and characters have been done before. &#34;Magnolia&#34; is a movie that does this much better than Crash did and yet, it was never nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. It had a stellar cast -- Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who won best Actor recently), Tom Cruise, etc. It really boggles my mind how Crash was even nominated for Best Picture.

When a friend gave me a boxed set of &#34;12 Amazing Scifi/Horror Movies!&#34; I was understandably a little cautious. But, since the item was a gift, I really didn&#39;t truly pay my common sense much heed. After all....movies for free! So what if they are a little ropey. After much consideration, Alien Intruder was the first of those movies. Ironically, it was first choice because it looked the best of the bunch. All I can say is, if this is the best of them, I shudder to think what the rest are like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the surface, it had some good things going for it. Four (count &#39;em!) actors that I was familiar with. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway. I told myself...&#34;Billy and Tracy have been in some good scifi (Star Wars and Babylon 5, respectively) so they wouldn&#39;t sign up for a turkey. Max is a veteran soap actor who never really managed to break into film....but not too shoddy an actor. An Jeff....well...he&#39;s done the good and the bad as far as films and TV go.&#34; I was soon to discover that Jeff had decided to add &#34;the ugly&#34; to his repertoire of movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first clue was in the opening scenes. Jeff mugs his way with gusto through an &#34;I&#39;m mad&#34; scene before finally killing himself. An amusing cameo performance, really. Unfortunately this is, without much exaggeration, the highlight of the film. It goes downhill from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up we have the commander of the mission (Williams) who is being sent out to see what happened to Jeff and his crew busy picking his new shipmates from among the ranks of the criminal element. But this assortment aren&#39;t so much the Dirty Dozen - more like the Unconvincing Foursome. Plus, one of the crims, a computer hacker, is shown in his cell working away on a laptop computer. Isn&#39;t that a bit like letting a murderer run a gun shop in the slammer? Pretty lame prison, if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they finally take off the effects are truly horrible. It looks like the spaceship model was knocked up in an afternoon by some bored 8 year old who had parts left over from his Airfix kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the horror doesn&#39;t stop there. Whilst on route to the area where Jeff&#39;s ship vanished, the criminal crew are rewarded for their good behaviour by being given weekends of virtual reality, in which they indulge their male fantasies. All well and good, and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the &#34;Alien Menace&#34; which begins to appear there. But did they have to drag it out for quite sooooo loooooong? Alien Intruder? Alien Boring, more like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally they make it to G-Sector and the alien presence makes them fight against each other for her affections until only good old Max is left. The ending, in truly optimistic rubbish film vein, hints at a sequel - as if! Also making an appearance in this movie is a character I&#39;ll nickname the &#34;Sweatdroid&#34;. He&#39;s supposed to be an android, but apparently that fact was lost on the make-up crew, who provided him with sweaty features at any opportunity. But don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s just there to make up the body count numbers at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Williams and Scoggins, to be truthful, do very little in the film. They only just barely stay awake, let alone act. And, as I mentioned earlier, Jeff gets an early trip to the showers, so his manicness isn&#39;t allowed to enlighten much of the film. Max tries his best, as do a couple of the other cast members, but the movie is just direly atrocious, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one, and only, half-way imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship naming convention. They are all named after musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the film is bland and uninspired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in 1992, I had thought, on initial viewing, it was one of those 80&#39;s straight-to-video jobs. Looks like they still made crap movies well into the 90&#39;s, it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s best avoided. Even as a beer n chips movie this film is a stinker, but at least you can fast forward it, I suppose.

What&#39;s the point of this film? It&#39;s totally forgettable. Unless you have a serious bunny fetish, look elsewhere. So the bunnies had a merit/demerit list. No chewing gum in front of the customers. Are we supposed to find that interesting?

Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough &#39;gov&#39;ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney&#39;s rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the &#39;cop on the edge&#39; and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended. (In response to the earlier comments, although I accept that &#39;Red&#39; would not &#39;normally&#39; drive away from a hit and run, he had just witnessed his brother arrested for murder, and I am fairly sure he does not see the boy move.)

Oh what a condescending movie! Set in Los Angeles, the center of the universe from the POV of Hollywood filmmakers, this movie tries to be a deep social commentary on contemporary American angst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stereotyped, smarmy characters of widely varying socio-economic backgrounds cross paths in their everyday, humdrum lives. The plot is disjointed and desultory. Numerous unimaginative plot contrivances keep the film going, like: a drive-by shooting, an abandoned baby left in the weeds, a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky over the city, a kid at summer camp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And through all these events, the one constant is the generous helping of sociological &#34;insights&#34; imparted through the dialogue, as characters compare notes on their life experiences. One character tells another: &#34;When you sit on the edge of that thing (the Grand Canyon), you realize what a joke we people are; ... those rocks are laughing at me, I could tell, me and my worries; it&#39;s real humorous to that Grand Canyon&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And another character pontificates about the meaning of it all: &#34;There&#39;s a gulf in this country, an ever widening abyss between the people who have stuff and the people who don&#39;t have ... it&#39;s like this big hole has opened up in the ground, as big as the ... Grand Canyon, and what&#39;s come pouring out ... is an eruption of rage, and the rage creates violence ...&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue, aside from the shallow, smarmy characters, aside from the dumb plot, the story&#39;s pace is agonizingly slow. Acting is uninspired and perfunctory. The film&#39;s tone is smug and self-satisfied, in the script&#39;s contempt for viewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a film project approved by Hollywood suits who fancy themselves as omnipotent gurus, looking down from on high. They think their film will be a startling revelation to us lowly, unknowing movie goers, eager to learn about the real meaning of American social change.

Michelle Pfeiffer stars as a mob widow who seeks a normal life but has her hands full with the new boss and an undercover agent. A lighthearted Demme film with some good laughs and Pfeiffer in a comical role that she has fun with..on a scale of one to ten..8

I know this film has had a fairly rough ride from the critics, but I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. The real star here is the fantastic Dylan Moran. He never fails to be both hilarious and convincing in all of his varied disguises. He also manages to radiate a sweet charm that belies his outrageous pratfalls. Special mention must also go to Michael Gambon who plays for laughs with a brilliantly accurate and yet comedic inner city Dublin accent. The only weak link is Caine who, while obviously having a great laugh hamming it up, plays the least interesting and most unsympathetic character. It probably won&#39;t play that well overseas but it&#39;s well worth a watch all the same.

Messiah was compulsive viewing from start to finish. The story centred on apparently random murders of men in London in various gruesome ways. DCI Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott)has to find the truth which, to his surprise, is a little closer to home than he might think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gripping drama and Ken Stott was brilliant. Hopefully we have not seen the last of DCI Red Metcalfe.

Well, on the endless quest for horror, we will come across this film, apparently re-released on DVD recently for some ungodly reason. The transfer is awful and the quality just sucks. I don&#39;t think this is due to a bad remaster or anything, I just think the film is poorly done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously filmed at an abandoned school with a budget that was no doubt wasted on cheap beer and no talent hacks, &#34;Slaughter High&#34; starts out slow and doesn&#39;t pick up pace until about an hour in. First, we get to see a &#39;nerd&#39; as he is picked on by a group of...I actually don&#39;t even know what they were supposed to be...jocks? The ringleader, with his ultra hooknose is so ugly he should have definitely been cast as the nerd. Then, there is a &#39;big guy&#39; and a couple of dumb losers and chicks who are supposed to be &#39;hot&#39; but aren&#39;t. It&#39;s a mystery why this group of rejects is picking on one of their own, but I guess the viewer is to assume these are &#39;cool kids&#39; picking on a dweeb. The casting choices are horrendous as most of the high schoolers are played by thirty-somethings. As other reviewers on here have pointed out, the actors (if you can call them that,) are a bunch of Brits whose accents slip out numerous times throughout this piece of crap. We are left to assume that this group of &#39;children&#39; were the only students at this school, as their &#39;reunion&#39; is only them at the school, which is now shown to be abandoned, is just them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kills are lame, the gore is not great and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; lines like: &#39;This place gives me the creeps...&#39; and &#39;Someone gimme a beer&#39; are highlights...It&#39;s just not good. Skip this one unless you are getting wasted with some friends and wanna laugh at a real lame attempt at a slasher. If you wanna see good, get Bava&#39;s &#34;Bay Of Blood,&#34; done 14 years earlier and a heck of a lot better. If you wanna see a good BAD slasher, see &#34;Just Before Dawn&#34; or &#34;The Burning.&#34; 2 out of 10, kids.

What you saw in BULLITT and THE FRENCH CONNECTION is nothing compared to what you have here. The chase goes on for nearly 15 minutes and is the best you&#39;ll ever see. This movie has become a classic crime drama from the heyday of 70&#39;s film-making. It&#39;s a gritty and realistic portrayal of the mean streets of New York City. Featuring one of the slickest wise guys ever put on screen, Tony Lo Bianco&#39;s behavior in this movie is cool as ice. He&#39;s ripping off his own associates and making it look like the police are responsible. His childhood friend, Roy Scheider, is a street detective who becomes puzzled by the disappearances of the mobsters. You can tell that Lo Bianco&#39;s enjoying the game throughout the movie. At times though, the film gets dull, but then right when you feel like giving up on it, something big happens and it pulls you back in. The score by Don Ellis sets the tone of the cold, gray wintertime in New York City and to top it all off, my man Joe Spinell shows up in an early role as Toredano the garage man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Score, 7 out of 10 Stars

Claudine is a movie that is representation of the american system at it&#39;s worst. The welfare system was initially set up as a stepping stone for those families who needed that extra hand to get back on their feet.The movie showed an accurate portrayal of how the welfare system breaks down the family unit. In other words if the father or any male figure is in the lives of the women and children their financial support from the system would be jeopardized if not terminated. The struggles of the poor can be seen throughout the world. I would like to see a reproduction of this movie back in the stores for all to rent or buy for their library collection.

I can&#39;t believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10. I could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons, but what would possess anyone to continue to rate it high after that? I was a huge fan the 1st season. I was hooked - all the mystery, suspense, unexplained events. You never knew what was going to happen next. By season 2, I was still watching faithfully, but was getting a little frustrated that some basic things had yet to be explained. And instead of giving you more answers, it just seemed like more questions. I LOVE suspense, but you have to throw people a bone every now and then to keep them watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I can&#39;t even remember what finally turned me off, but somewhere in season 2, I had enough. I&#39;m not a big fan of appointment viewing - and you clearly can&#39;t miss an episode to stay up on what&#39;s happening. So, it was no longer worth the effort to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a shame that they couldn&#39;t have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that it appears ABC just got greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show out. Don&#39;t they realize that in the end, they are going to lose more fans than they could possibly gain.

This is a slick little movie well worth your time to find and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really speaks to all those mundane choices we all make every day and (like an H.G. Welles Story I can&#39;t quite recall) may live to want back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this is a SHORT (very short). It starts out slowly but just as you begin to think it has become boring =bang= it&#39;s over. And, believe me, the &#39;punch line&#39; is one you will remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not sure if the producers are going to make it available for purchase - or available on the web but either way you&#39;d be happy you took the time to get hold of a copy - of that I am sure.

If you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one. A setting and acting as in a Porn movie but nothing is happening only some groping and touching of the third kind. Which actually becomes very boring after 45 minutes of touchy feely but no action. A few of the actors I&#39;ve seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better. All the special effects are done by the great &#34;Rondo&#34; Whom performs all the magic whit his mind. A cult movie is written on the box. Does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve ore thanks giving.

Wladyslaw Starewicz was a Russian-born animator living in France who did incredible things using stop-motion. I&#39;ve seen a couple of these films before and they feature his favorite subjects--insects, frogs and various animals. They are extremely realistic and lifelike and even today are amazing to watch--the quality is simply fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one stars lots and lots of frogs. They appeal to their god, Jupiter, to give them a king. Why do they need a king, wonders Jupiter--their lives are perfectly fine now. So, to teach them a nasty lesson, he makes an Egret the king and one by one it starts eating its subjects! Then, the frogs once again appeal to Jupiter, who states the obvious moral that it&#39;s best to be happy with what you have! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the animation quality is incredible, this is a very creepy film for kids. I would think this would terrify them both by how real the animals look as well as the story itself which is not for the faint of heart!

I&#39;ve never been a big Larry Clark fan, but somehow, I&#39;ve been dragged to almost every single one of his movies. Now, I like independent films, and I grew up very much into punk rock, and I&#39;d like to say that this film is disappointing to both audiences. Not every punk song incorporates &#34;Oi!&#34; into its choruses, as they do in this particular film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real problem with this film is that it switches moods every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of cohesion. Clark has made his living pretending that his fictionalized stories are &#34;how kids really are,&#34; and as such, you&#39;ll allow him ten minute scenes of stupid dialog that go nowhere, because that&#39;s the cinema verite feel he&#39;s going for. However, when he shoots a ridiculous death scene (pick any of them, save for the opening drive-by), the over-stylized attempts at what I assume is intended to be black humor are completely out of context, ridiculously shot (in most cases, far worse than a student film) and absolutely ludicrous in terms of the story. John Cassavettes and &#34;Date Movie&#34; make poor bedfellows, as the forays into the latter style take you out of any kind of reality to remind you that you&#39;re watching a movie - a really, really bad one at that.

Hehehe. This was one of the best funny road movies ever! I laughed so I fell out of the chair. With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves. Harald Zwart is the producer, known for films like Agent Cody banks and of course One Night at McCool&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is about Norwegian crazy fans, going to the world cup in Soccer in Germany 2006. And all sort of crazy fun that comes with it. It was hilarious. I couldn&#39;t stop laughing. I haven&#39;t had so much fun in ages. Rumors say it will come a number two, but I do not know. It will be hard beating this one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommended to everyone! It is a must see film. I was suppose to see it at the cinema, but I had work at the times it where shown. And been trying to rent it for a month, but all the time rented out. Got it today on DVD. Well worth it.

This is a great movie, all 3 were. The last one was not as good as the first 2 but it was made along time after and it was pulling at straws. But you want to watch it cause it tells the end of the story. Just not how we might think it should end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These movies made me want to be there to be in all the hardship, love, tears, and laughter that the people in this movie go threw. It is one of the few movies that is good every time you see it no matter how many times that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some parts in the movie that the little kids wont understand and the older ones maynot be old enough to watch. but it is a great movie, spanning over 20+ years.

I watched this film not really expecting much, I got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, i.e damned annoying and, well thats about it actually, the problem is that its just so boring, in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension, a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious (I had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking, coz they don&#39;t half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot, I thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and I haven&#39;t even mentioned the killer, I&#39;m not even gonna go into it, its just not worth explaining. Anyway as far as I&#39;m concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London (who was actually quite funny) it wasn&#39;t because of their acting talent, I&#39;ve certainly seen a lot worse, but I&#39;ve also seen a lot better. Best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry.

In &#34;Anne of Green Gables&#34; (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (O.P. Heggie), middle-aged siblings who live together at Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, decide to adopt a boy from distant orphanage to help on their farm. But the orphan sent to them is a precocious girl of 14 named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris-a veteran of Disney&#39;s series of &#34;Alice&#34; shorts who later would adopt her character&#39;s name). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne was only 11 in Lucy Maude Montgomery&#39;s source novel but the same actress could not credibly go from 11 to college age during the course of the story. The movie suffers somewhat from this concession, as many of Anne&#39;s reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining coming from an eleven-year-old that from a teenager. As in the book, Anne is bright and quick, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, her build, her freckles, and her long red hair. Being a child of imagination, however, Anne takes much joy in life, and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact Anne is the original &#34;Teenage Drama Queen&#34; and the film&#39;s screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character. Which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy. A change that delighted audiences and that continues to frustrate reader purists. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the comedy is very much in the spirit of the Montgomery&#39;s story I can see no reason to take issue with the changes, but let this serve as fair warning to anyone expecting a totally faithful adaptation. The comedy element is the strength of the film as it is one of the earliest self-reflexive parodies of Hollywood conventions. The actress Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood&#39;s all- time beauties and the film is in black and white. So much of the amusement is in seeing the title character&#39;s endless laments about her appearance and hair color contradicted by what is appearing on the screen. Anne regularly regales her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like: &#34;If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me&#34;. Perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom blackboard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Brown does a nice job as Anne&#39;s love interest Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steals all the scenes in which she appears as the Cuthbert&#39;s pompous neighbor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, what do I know? I&#39;m only a child.

A beautiful postcard of New York. The thing I enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear. It never did. My teenagers liked it too. My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and ALL enjoy something. This film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done. The ending came with a twist which we all liked too. If you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you. As a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did. I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch.

Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code film starring some of the best of the era. It is set in the maternity ward of a hospital, particularly in the room for the women expected to have trouble. In it is an older woman, a tough unwed mother (Glenda Farrell), a frail young woman, an Italian woman, and the main character (Loretta Young) who is spending 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) is at the hospital at every second aching to know that everything will be okay. Aline MacMahone plays the nurse who is great at her job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is highly interesting and entertaining. It isn&#39;t terribly shocking in any way, but it is interesting to see such a neglected subject on the silver screen. The acting is brilliant all around. Loretta Young is gorgeous here in her prime. Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere as can be. His innocence is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is great as always, a staple of pre-codes and for good reason.

huge Ramones fan. i do like the ramones, and i suppose if you hate them, then, besides being a avid Bush supporter, you might not like this classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#39;s immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80&#39;s. infinitely better than the American Pie&#39;s that plague us now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some other great high school films: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times..., Class of &#39;84, Three O&#39;Clock High, and the cheesy yet gripping(doesn&#39;t seem possible) River&#39;s Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it&#39;s the funniest and most fun, plus you can get up and dance with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love you, Riff Randell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10

This is one of those topics I can relate to a little more than most people as I hate noise &amp; have no idea how those in big cities, New York especially how people get any sleep at all! It astounds me that people can stand all the noise out there these days. The basic plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting topic. It&#39;s too bad that&#39;s about it. Tim Robbbins is decent although except for a couple of scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel looking Margarita Leiveva) he didn&#39;t seem to really be altogether there. My biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning &amp; talented actress to boot, Margarita Levieva. She doesn&#39;t have a lot to do, but she is supermodel beautiful. Even when they are trying to make her look at more girl next door. It makes me sad that there can be people such as Paris Hilton &amp; Kim Kardashian in the world w/no redeemable skills or talent, to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I didn&#39;t care for much of this film because the script isn&#39;t very good, but am glad I got to see some new talent. I hope that producers &amp; directors think about Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in there big budget film. If they can make Megan Fox a star (c&#39;mon she isn&#39;t that hot, &amp; her acting &#34;talent&#34; is worse than made-for Disney channel TV shows) from 1 film, it should happen easily for her, as she is gorgeous &amp; has talent! I&#39;d recommend her changing her last name so we can pronounce it and make it more marketable. Here&#39;s hoping this makes her career, &amp; if there is any justice she can pop up on some big summer movie or two in the next couple years.

It&#39;s not like I have overwhelmingly fond memories of Verhoeven&#39;s original pants-down shocker - it always struck me as a glossy, well-made airport-novel-of-a-movie. Thrilling, sexy trash, but trash nonetheless. It was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist. After a decade of anti-sex AIDS-induced hysteria, a film about a wildly-sexual hotbod who thrill-kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff. Basic Instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy, so the fact that it&#39;s desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sort-of be overlooked. All it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable. That it resoundingly fails on so many levels, and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved, is really quite extraordinary to watch. Let&#39;s state the obvious for starters - Sharon Stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet Catherine Trammell. What was so photogenic thru Verhoeven&#39;s lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun-for-hire Michael Caton-Jones, who&#39;s flat, drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot. I like Sharon Stone a lot, but if the first film launched her career, BI2 could kill it. She has no chemistry with stuffed-shirt David Morrissey - their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch. His dough-faced mamma&#39;s boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering, orange-skin machismo of Michael Douglas. Supporting turns by David Thewlis and Charlotte Rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and cliché-heavy posturing. And what of the much-touted sexual shenanigans? Poorly-lit, fleetingly-glimpsed, as utterly mainstream as an episode of Desperate Housewives - the European sensibilities that Verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed. Don&#39;t watch this film for carnal thrills - there are none and what there is is tragic. The film is, as a whole, convoluted to the point of utter confusion, boring and laughable. The last 40 minutes in particular, where you come to the realisation that the film is, in fact, not going to go anywhere of interest at all, are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure. As a failed sequel, Basic Instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as Exorcist 2 The Heretic, Beyond The Poseidon Adventure and XXX2. As a vanity project, it rivals Battlefield Earth in its misconception. As a multi-million dollar piece of Hollywood film-making, it&#39;s a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst.

I suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early Sofia Loren film. She was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I viewed this film because I wanted to see some of Sofia Loren&#39;s early work. I was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an Ethiopian princess. Surely, today, this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making. It actually became annoying watching Ms. Loren in skin color paint throughout the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie. Then, the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent. I discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As beautiful as Ms. Loren was at age 19 and still is today, the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage. After all, we don&#39;t see beautiful young people on stage with &#34;old opera singers&#34; back stage singing from behind the curtain! Do not discount the success of using heavy-weight opera singers. One only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the J. G. Wentworth Company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the company&#39;s product. This is one of the best and entertaining TV commercials produced to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality. The color ink has faded much and that can not be helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To improve this film on DVD the production company should add English language subtitles so that we, who do not speak Italian, can know what the lyrics are saying. It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch this film not because of the story of Aida nor the fact that this is an opera. Aside from Ms. Sofia Loren none of her co-actors are known nor remembered by this writer. Instead, watch this movie if you are a fan of Ms. Loren and wish to see her at age 19 -- no matter what the production is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larry from Illinois

&#34;I thought I&#39;d be locked away in a padded cell and they&#39;d throw away the key&#34; (Thus is a paraphrased snatch of dialogue from &#34;State of Mind&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One wonders in what tangled forest Paula Milne and her co-writer found the magic mushrooms they must have eaten, to create this feeble &#34;whodunnit&#34; and bring such rubbish to our screens. A padded cell should indeed be left available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niamh Cusack did her best, (as did the other actors) but surely her talent deserves a better vehicle than this. The height of absurdity has been reached, and this particular &#34;State of Mind&#34; is best buried and forgotten, and certainly not just &#34;placed in a box and locked away in a drawer&#34;.

This film is replete with sentimentality, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe, and irrelevant material. Why introduce Rachel, for instance? She has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her &#34;Follow Me&#34; truck to run wild and crash into Dorinda&#39;s fence. That has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film. Another is at the end when the aircraft (was it a B-26 or an A-26? --both designations are used in the film) is left with props whirling and no chocks in place. That serves the plot, of course, but to reveal it would be to commit a dreaded spoiler. As it is, the aircraft would have begun to taxi sans control. The ending (again, avoiding spoilers) involves much too much talk -- as at the beginning of sound films in the 30s with all those final speeches. Here, Dreyfuss just babbles on and on. The ending also incorporates other radical violations of aircraft protocol and a couple of improbabilities/impossibilities that I won&#39;t describe. What a dull and disjointed effort!

&#34;The Lady from Shanghai&#34; is well known as one of Hollywood&#39;s most troubled productions. Welles&#39; original cut was taken away by the producers and cut to ribbons. This made the already muddled mystery story even more difficult to keep track of. They post dubbed a good amount of his dialog because of the density of the Irish accent, and the dubbing is all too apparent and poorly done. Most disastrous of all, Welles and his on screen and real life leading lady Rita Hayworth were falling apart in their relationship, and their tumultuous chemistry comes through on screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, this is all overcome by just how fantastic Orson Welles&#39; direction is. He makes the film incredibly stylish and atmospheric - every scene just seems to be breathing down your back from the screen. Also, the characters and scenes are so bizarre they border on dreamlike and surreal. This sense of weirdness elevates scenes that are often found in these films, such as the courtroom sequences in the middle. I typically find courtroom dramas a bore, but Welles&#39; direction and quirky touches make them just as fascinating as everything else. The ending at the carnival reminds one of David Lynch almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting here is also very good. Despite their failing relationship, Welles and Hayworth both give decent performances - their interactions however are just a bit lacking. Everyone else is superb and delightful to watch though, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. &#34;The Lady from Shanghai&#34; obviously has its problems, but its worth watching just to see one of cinema&#39;s masters at his finest. (8/10)

It&#39;s one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in the last 2 years (I&#39;ve seen the premier in Tel-Aviv, Israel in the summer of 2006, exactly when the last war has began...) This problem in communication between the people, that causes wars, is interesting me for a long time, and it doesn&#39;t matter who- boys and girls, straight and gays, Jews and Arabs... I&#39;ve seen the Bubble already 3 times, and it still surprising and exciting me- each character reminds me of one of the many people i know, and the difference between them, like between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem... The last time i saw it- was with my friend, who is a Christian Arab, and it was on the independence day of Israel ( the most symbolic i could ! how ironic) and... he cried in the end!!! - if he&#39;s been touched and wasn&#39;t embarrassed- everyone would be touched by The Bubble!

This movie is flawed on many fronts. Like many before it, it portrays more of the mythology of the Alamo than the history. The production is poor, overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on Hollywood Squares. This to me was the greatest flaw - I know the ages and general personalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of TV actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a native Texan, I grew up with the mythology. I later learned more about the history. I can accept a decent production from either perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it. Even John Wayne&#39;s or Fess Parker&#39;s versions had more life than this stolid mess, while being only slightly less accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing - avoid it.

I saw this feature as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and was horrified by the graphic, sado-masochistic, child pornography that I witnessed. The story line is hidden beneath way too many graphic sex scenes - and, not one is in the least bit erotic - sick is the more the feeling. The director seemed to be going for shock value rather the exploring the various levels of why these characters are like this. See it if you can stomach it - I still have flashbacks.

This is one of the worst films I&#39;ve seen in years!! You could randomly pluck 5 people off the streets and they could act better than anyone in this film. Absolute waste of time watching it. I only gave it a 2 as I like gory films but this is just plain rubbish. The acting (and I use that term VERY loosely) is abysmal, someone please tell me that the 5 main actors in this were making their first ever film?? Don&#39;t waste your time watching this. Hostel was a better film by some way. I cannot believe that someone has spent money making this, I hope for the producers sake it only cost $50,000 to make - it looks like a school project, made by kids who haven&#39;t got a clue. Did this even make it to the cinema??

The statistics in this movie were well researched. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got. Al Gore is certainly quite an actor. He sounds so concerned. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this movie, there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk, but walks the walk as well. When Carter thought we needed to conserve energy, he turned down the thermostat in the White House and got warm by wearing a sweater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al Gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet. How much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create? How much energy does it take to heat Gore&#39;s swimming pool behind his mansion? It would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used. But if we did, the power company would react to a 50% reduction of energy by calling it a &#34;50% loss in revenue&#34; and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50%. So &#34;just turning it off&#34; would not be a very good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is a veiled appeal to allow Big Goivernment to take control of everything, in the name of saving planet earth, that is.

I thought that Eastwood&#39;s most unusual role was that in The Bridges of Madison County, but that was until I saw The Beguiled. He manages to pull it off, giving a very good performance and so does the rest of the cast. The direction is imaginative given that the film was made in 1971 and had there not been some plot holes - which the director seems to struggle to cover up at times - we would be talking about an excellent film. It remains powerful, nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8

London Dreams, directed by Vipul Shah, is a frustratingly foolish film about foolish people. It&#39;s the kind of film whose central conflict could be instantly resolved if the characters concerned simply sat down and had a chat. Ajay Devgan plays Arjun, an aspiring pop-artiste obsessed with performing before a cheering crowd at London&#39;s Wembley Stadium. He becomes jealous of his devoted best friend and band-mate Manu, played by Salman Khan, who is evidently more talented than him, but nowhere near as focused or ambitious. Arjun decides to sabotage Manu when the latter&#39;s popularity threatens to outshine his own. Now here&#39;s where a heart-to-heart might have helped. Had Arjun explained what this Wembley fixation meant to him, Manu would have graciously backed off and let Arjun fulfill his childhood dream, and we&#39;d have been spared the agony of watching the rest of this uninspiring drivel. But director Vipul Shah and his writers are in no mood to do us any favours. London Dreams is packed with unintentionally hilarious gems like that back-story involving Arjun&#39;s grandpa who committed suicide out of shame for getting stage-fright at a packed Wembley concert. Or the ridiculous incident at a show where Manu must take over vocal responsibilities after a blast of confetti practically chokes Arjun into silence. The idiocy, however, doesn&#39;t end there. In his attempts to shame Manu publicly, Arjun uses his connections to get Manu hooked onto drugs. A buxom groupie urges Manu to down a couple of tequila shots with her but replaces his salt with cocaine. Before you know it, Manu has acquired quite the appetite for the addictive white powder, practically chomping it down like dinner. If that isn&#39;t silly enough, there&#39;s a crude scene later in which Manu chases after the said girl to find out who she&#39;s been taking orders from. The pursuit ends in a dark London alley where the girl gets down on her knees pretending to do the unmentionable so as to mislead Manu&#39;s girlfriend who&#39;s been secretly following after them. Wait, there&#39;s more! Expect to howl hysterically when Arjun snaps off his belt and whips himself mercilessly to banish all thoughts of romance or lust towards the band&#39;s lead dancer Priya (played by Asin) because nothing and no one must distract him from his musical goals. Too generously inspired by Milos Forman&#39;s Amadeus for it to merit any comparison with last year&#39;s Rock On!, Vipul Shah&#39;s latest is a clunky melodrama that&#39;s as loosely directed as it is scripted. The film goes for broad humor, over-the-top emotions, and basically chooses loudness over subtlety. That works for Manu&#39;s character, with Salman Khan playing him all loutish and lovable, but in the case of Arjun, Ajay Devgan comes off too passive with a performance that is mostly internalised. When Arjun does reach boiling point however, it results in an awkward pre-climax scene in which he lectures a packed concert hall and is understandably pelted with plastic bottles as punishment. Of the remaining cast, there&#39;s not a kind word I can say for Asin, who practically lit up Ghajini with her ebullient charm, but disappoints here with unnecessary over-acting in a thankless role. Ranvijay Singh and Aditya Roy Kapur, reduced to mere sidekicks in the band, show up at regular intervals, usually to utter some inane dialogue like, &#34;We&#39;ll rock it dude!&#34; For its dim-witted writing and sloppy direction, London Dreams is ultimately a tiresome watch. If you must, watch it for Salman Khan who&#39;s turned buffoonery into a bonafide acting style. It&#39;s the only thing that&#39;ll make you smile in this sad, sad film.

This British documentary was recently shown on Comedy Central during their &#34;Best of&#34; week and can also be seen on South Park&#39;s second season DVD. I remember seeing many commercials for the DVD showing clips of this documentary, most of which occurs with Matt Stone, Trey Parker, and some other guy in a hot tub. It was funny when I saw it in the commercials, but I was used to seeing it by the time I saw the actual documentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, &#34;Goin&#39; Down to South Park&#34; is a fairly funny and interesting look at how South Park episodes are made and of the series&#39; history going back to when Matt and Trey came up with the idea in college. However, there was something about the tone of this documentary that actually felt sort of depressing. It&#39;s not as fast-paced, rapid-fire, and as lively as the actual South Park episodes. Instead, it kind of has a slow, dry-wit style, which at times can be funny, but most of the time you&#39;re just waiting for something to happen. If you get the chance to watch it, by all means go for it, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re really missing much if you never see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My IMDb Rating: 7/10

How is this a documentary? Much more like a walking ghost tour one might take in any given Southern city. Quotes were generously dropped throughout without the first effort at identifying the source. George Orwell was the most identified quoter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Documents were referred to without ever being produced in any form. Flat out fraudulent shots depicting period film stock were spliced aside historical film reels with no separation from reality and self-promotion. Film reels which were entirely unrealistic and improbable for the time at hand were dropped in, as if trying to ape Blair Witch, hoping to drum up a spook house on what would otherwise simply be dead real estate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this not in some way a great disrespect to actual victims of TB, a dance on their collective graves for the sake of commercialism? The line between actual footage and manufactured self-service is so thin; the drippings of doubt so insignificantly played down; the scientific boundaries so blatantly ignored... how could this possibly be listed in my TiVo as documentary? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a vacation promo, and at that it fully succeeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hell, I&#39;d visit the joint if I could locate it on Google Earth. Not scary said a previous poster. Not too serious either, says I. Fascinating story. Flimsy film-making.

This movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people. There are only three locations (the school, the store, and the coach&#39;s house) that are really used. It&#39;s primarily at the coach&#39;s house, however. A movie doesn&#39;t need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up. One is rich, important, and has no real love outside of money. One wants to be mayor again, but his competition is turning him sour. One wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family. One is a traveling alcoholic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I love the actors in this film. They&#39;ve all been household names to me. They proved their worth here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most pivotal moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, blows up on the coach. He yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game. His blows the coach&#39;s whistle and yells back his catchphrases - &#34;Forgive me Father, for I have sinned!&#34; It&#39;s amazing to watch, with energy that just chills you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesn&#39;t need shiny effects to interest them.

This is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie. The acting is excellent considering the script &amp; the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding. The gore is well done and used sparingly (look out for the excellent barbed-wire death) &amp; the action is punchy when used. It&#39;s true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times, but compared to other movies on the same (or bigger!) budget, it&#39;s hardly noticeable at all. Overall, this is recommended. Trust me, it&#39;s better than it appears! 8/10

This is by far the most awful movie I have ever watched. I have never before rated a movie 1 out of 10. My advice is don&#39;t watch it. This doesn&#39;t even classify as a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;d be better off sitting on the couch bored rather than watching this movie. Acting was terrible but what was worst by far was the storyline. Highly unlikely sequence of events which aren&#39;t even funny. They are actually very lame and stupid. Very foolish choice by Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid to act in this movie. Might even upset their careers a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I walked into Blockbuster, the main focus was on this movie , so I decided rent it. I sincerely regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#39;re 10 or 20 minutes into the movie you could basically predict what was going to happen. I was hoping it would get better , but instead it got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not exaggerating this. The movie is terrible. Don&#39;t watch it. Hope this helps.

This was a watershed event in my movie watching life. I went to see this in the theater when it came out. I was completely amazed at just how bad it was. Movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor - a very, very large favor. The special effects are absolutely first grade level, as in any first grader could have done them. Toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings, arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you&#39;d find on a street sign, and a laughable story line. Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to &#34;Conquest&#34;. Every film student should see this thing just so they&#39;ll know the very definition of a bad movie.

The episodic version of Robert Heinlein&#39;s Starship Troopers plays out at a deathly slow pace, following Johnny Rico leaving his parents, the (not very attractive) girl he lusts for, and joining the mobile infantry. The aliens in the show are nothing like the barbaric bugs from the film, instead being squid-like monsters that shoot lasers out of their mouths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout watching this version, I was continually amazed at just how fruity they&#39;ve managed to make the whole thing. The show is concerned mostly with the relationships between the recruits, and the aching, prolonged gazes they give each other through their battle armour visors, with 80s synth pop sometimes arriving *during* the sparse battle sequences which at last turning up in the final few episodes. In terms of construction, it owes a debt to Top Gun, sharing much in terms of pacing and content (and all that implies).

At the beginning of the film we watch May and Toots preparing for their trip to London for a visit to their grown children. One can see Toots is not in the best of health, but he goes along. When he dies suddenly, May&#39;s world, begins to spin out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film directed by Roger Michell, based on a screen play by Hanif Kureshi, is a study of how this mother figure comes to terms with her new status in life and her awakening into a world that she doesn&#39;t even know it existed until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May&#39;s life as a suburban wife was probably boring. Obviously her sexual life was next to nothing. We get to know she&#39;s had a short extra marital affair, then nothing at all. When May loses her husband she can&#39;t go back home, so instead, she stays behind minding her grandson at her daughter&#39;s home. It is in this setting that May begins lusting after young and hunky Darren, her daughter&#39;s occasional lover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darren awakes in May a passion she has not ever known. May responds by transforming herself in front of our eyes. May, who at the beginning of the film is dowdy, suddenly starts dressing up, becoming an interesting and attractive woman. She ends up falling heads over heels with this young man that keeps her sated with a passion she never felt before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having known a couple of cases similar to this story, it came as no surprise to me to watch May&#39;s reaction. Her own chance of a normal relationship with Bruce, a widower, ends up frustratingly for May, who realizes how great her sex is with Darren. The younger man, we figure, is only into this affair to satisfy himself and for a possibility of extorting money from May. Finally, the daughter, Helen discovers what Mum has been doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings her mother has made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is a triumph for the director. In Anne Reid, Mr. Michell has found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of May. Also amazing is Daniel Craig. He knows how Darren will react to the situation. Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also vital to the story as she is the one that has to confront the mother about what has been going on behind her back. Oliver Ford Davies plays a small part as Bruce the older man in Helen&#39;s class and is quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is rewarding for those that will see it with an open mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Non existent plot, tons of poorly directed / super-cheesy scenes (Snipers / world famous sharpshooters who can&#39;t even hit their targets a few feet away? plus what&#39;s up with the ending?---&gt; a bunch of law enforcers vandalizing a carnival&#39;s shooting gallery? WTH?), technical mistakes (how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a glock? 100+? These people fire their guns without the need of reloading). The movie is so bad that even senior Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn (Aliens, terminator) can&#39;t save this junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO not watch this movie (I realized that I wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this one). Hopefully the director would either stop making movies, or learn more for his next movie.

Patricia Hunter: Oh, professor, do you also make a habit of collecting coffins? Dr. Lorenz: Why, yes, in a manner of speaking. I find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting Bela Lugosi (Glen or Glenda, Dracula) vehicle where he plays the mad scientist. I was especially creeped out when he appeared in the bedrooms of his guests when they were sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luana Walters (Girls in Prison) was really appealing as a sensual reporter, Patricia Hunter&lt; who was to be a victim, but woman-power trumps evil scientist every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2&#39;11&#34; Angelo Rossitto and creepy Frank Moran , who liked to stoke the women&#39;s hair added to the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting look at a 40s horror film.

A truly masterful piece of filmmaking. It managed to put me to sleep and to boggle my mind. So boring that it induces sleep and yet so ludicrous that it made me wonder how stuff like this gets made. Avoid at all costs. That is, unless you like taking invisible cranial punishment, in which case I highly recommend it.

Its spelled S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character flashed her boobs. That was pretty tight. Before and after that the movie pretty much blows. The acting is like E-list and it&#39;s shown well in the movie. Not to mention it is so low budget that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person. The whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film. The only other reason I liked the movie was because Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said many stupid things that made me laugh. Other than that if you see this movie at Blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated.

This is a delightful movie that is so over-the-top that my wife, daughter, and I found it irresistible. The plot is just crazy but &#34;rings true&#34; to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly enjoyed Kevin Kline&#39;s and Sally Field&#39;s performances. I don&#39;t anyone better than Kline at playing THICKheaded. Field&#39;s character&#39;s truly desperate need for attention and affirmation -- and her almost bipolar swings in mood -- played nicely against the background of Field&#39;s famous (infamous?) &#34;You like me!&#34; Oscar exclamation. People who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is the only movie where I didn&#39;t find myself impatient with Whoopi Goldberg characterization; I thought she was &#34;spot on&#34; in every note she struck. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty, and Elizabeth Shue were also first-rate as well. Just a great movie if you&#39;re in the mood to go along for the ride and LAUGH!

This is probably the best documentary I have seen in a very long time. Jonny Kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration. Not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love. Watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart-wrenching. Listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming. And seeing him smile was indescribable. I feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant. Please, if you ever have a chance to watch this film - consider yourself lucky to have met Jonny Kennedy.

when i read other comment,i decided to watch this movie...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, cast specially Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; good enough...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Film,very intelligence and interesting because ,cast have a lot of international specially European actor and actress like from Turkey and Russsia...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second,Story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you&#39;ll like in my opinion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third,Final chapter is not special or interesting,it&#39;s regular like other action movies...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally,i recommend to watch this movie...And i hope You&#39;ll love it enjoy :D

One of the most provocative films ever with excellent cinematography backed up by Mc Clarens lisp and stunning quote &#34;do you believe in love at first site?&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trace of expressionism was evident in this picture, further catapulting the films flawless integrity. Gabby (AKA Joey) played by Eva Longoria clearly loved the movie and role she played so much that she couldn&#39;t even be bothered giving it mention in her filmography. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt, the heroic rescue by MC clure as he saved the young &#39;Handicapped&#39; kid with the speech impediment.. Which i may add was acted to perfection! James Cahiil&#39;s use of sound effects is unmatched even to this day. The drug bust he performs early in the film is pain stakingly realistic. When i watched this movie for the first time i was so compelled with the intense lack of respect for the Gang Inthused brothers from the Southside gang and the CTM (Cut Throat Mafia). This was by far one of the most encapsulating crevice Cahill has committed to filming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally this film holds sentimental value to me and i will be downloading it in the near future. Thats if i can find it anywhere, LOL!

If you have read the book - do not set your hopes high, if you have not - go read it, and never watch the film. It is strange to learn that Toby Young was actually involved a lot in the writing of the script (as he claims himself in the post script of the book). Because the film is very different from the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the film seems to be aiming at - taking a rather thought provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with plain funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone would understand it - it achieves with perfection. The film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for a sitcoms, and has lost any meaningful message that it could have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are better off not seeing it.

Oliver Gruner is totally unknown to me. My friend showed me this film because he had seen Gruner in, what he called a pretty good sci-fi film, Nemesis. So as we watched this, we found ourselves fastforwarding through the BS drama parts just to get to the unbelievable action sequences. Gruner loves to kick and kick and kick. And kick! haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in. He finds himself watching after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in the Mexican gang that keeps tormenting his family. Instead of joining up, Gruner tells the boy to fight back (against a gang? too crazy). Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character who kills everyone (or maims them pretty bad) and works to rid his block of these gangmembers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot was very cheesy and easy to think of. Gruner is probably not very well known because of his script-choosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to. This ghetto is pure hell and I enjoyed seeing the motley crew of characters go through it as if they have a chance against Gruner&#39;s character. The music was typical action music (thumping pianos and timpani, swelling guitars) which actually wasn&#39;t as bad as I make it sound. The director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I gave it a 4/10 because it really tried to be an average action film for Oliver Gruner to star in, but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw.

This movie was on the pay channels today and I had nothing to do so I had it on. This has to be the worst football movie ever made. This has to be one of the worst movies period. The premium service on the cable system has a rating system, and they gave 2 stars out of 4. This movie isn&#39;t even a half a star. Bad acting, Scott Bakula sinks as usual, Larry Miller?? Sinbad, couldn&#39;t act if he tried. Rob Schneider&#39;s one liners completely stunk. Fred Thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this movie. The only saving grace for this movie was the hope you would see Kathy Ireland nude in the shower, not even close. A complete waste of time and of film. If we could give a negative number, minus 9.

I found this film to be the usual French slap in America&#39;s face. The camera, all too often, focuses on fat people, on sloppy homes and on tacky rural areas. While the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folks who are introduced to the viewer, the cinematography exploits and demeans them. There were, undoubtedly, thin people to be seen in Glencoe and neat, organized homes, but Malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only hope that some American filmmakers will go to France to reveal to the American public its worst elements. I can assure you, as a frequent visitor to France, that all is not well there. Foreign immigrants are not readily assimilated, thus creating severe social inequities. But Americans are not eager to unmask the French for their prejudice toward their own compatriots and their envy toward the U.S., so we&#39;re not likely to see films on the subject.

Set in 1962 Hong Kong (in turbulent times, as we are informed), this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between a two married people tied to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old Hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors, evocative yet restrained sensuality (as opposed of the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes which has become part of the norm of a romance in film), and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication. It&#39;s not hard to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here, since she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as describing powerful drama using the art of verbal and non-verbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of re-enacting scenes that could eventually take place in both the characters&#39; lives. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE, her pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in reaffirming this relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot even resembles something that Duras could have written: Mr. Chow and Mrs. Su Li-zhen, neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals, begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their spouses are cheating on them, and they discover quite naturally, it&#39;s with each other. The question is, should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners? Every scene plays with the notion that at any moment they will give in to each other, and at one point, it is suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their encounters (which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of Cheung&#39;s dresses), we never see it. And just as not seeing either of their spouses heightens their own love story, not seeing them carry through with their attraction makes the eventual separation even the more bitter because at every moment we want for something to happen -- some catalyst -- and the only one which comes is when Leung reveals to her that he loves her, followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband, which implies that neither will he. It also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do: from a Western point of view, a consummation of their romance into a more solid, lasting affair would have been possible especially in the 60s, but as it&#39;s Hong Kong, cultural values are markedly different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performances here are of the high order: it&#39;s very easy to play a torrid love affair, but to continually play a repressed, platonic relationship that is brimming with desire only barely suggested is hard and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual. Cheung and Leung smolder and their blighted chemistry lingers long after the credits have rolled.

This film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever. Ever. But in my opinion it is possibly the funniest. The horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless. I bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain DVD&#39;s at my local pound shop. Me and some friends then watched it, admittedly whilst rather drunk. It soon occurred that this wasn&#39;t any normal film. Instead a priceless relic of what will probably be James Cahill&#39;s last film. At first we were confused and were screaming for the DVD player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no-one could be bothered. Instead we watched the film right through. At the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream, something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours, whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons. We soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed, this wasn&#39;t a work of abysmal film. This was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at. This was a film that anyone can enjoy. This was genius.

As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was &#34;not very profound.&#34; I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I&#39;ve ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die. It is about a man seeing more value in a girl than she saw in herself. It reminded me strongly of the book Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers, which has a similar story of redemption. Yes, the images and themes are messy and sometimes shocking, but if you look close enough, you may just see yourself in these characters. Sometimes the truest things in life are not pretty, but they are real.

This movie is beautifully designed! There are no flaws. Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a complex game where the participants are on a simple mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paxton is at his best in this role. His mannerisms, the infections used in the tones of his voice are without miscue. Each shot meticulously done! Surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour. This may not be the best picture of the year, but it&#39;s a gem that has been very well polished. It&#39;s not for the simple mind.

WORTH IT FOR: If not for Mick Molloy&#39;s work, then for Judith Lucy. She brings her usual classy style of unbridled foul-mouthery to the role, and steals the show in parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMHO: I&#39;m not much of an autograph hunter, but I have collected 3. The first is Samuel L. Jackson&#39;s, the other 2 are in this movie: Tony Martin and Mick Molloy. Altho Martin only makes a cameo appearance, Molloy not only stars but co-wrote and co-produced this flick. I&#39;ve been a fan of their for years now (apparently I was the only one laughing during the on-set urination in the first episode of the short lived The Mick Molloy Show), so I went in to this with high expectations. I&#39;m happy to say I wasn&#39;t disappointed. With Mick doing a lot of the work on this thing there&#39;s plenty of his usual trademarks. Phrases like &#34;blow it out your arse&#34; and &#34;these bowls are s***house&#34; are all over the place, aswell as plenty of Winnie Blues being sucked down. It&#39;s also the sort of stupid, original story you&#39;d expect from someone like him. This is like one of those cliqued, American, sporting comedies where they make a baseball team out of prisoners or something. But rather than trying to make a dull American sport like baseball or gridiron interesting, this movie focuses on a sport usually left to grey army: Lawn Bowls. But the main difference between this and other sporting type comedies is that this is actually very, very funny. What&#39;s even better is that even tho the subject of this movie is a young lout joining an old folks game, it&#39;s never insulting to the elderly, and it never gets sickeningly soppy or anything. It&#39;s just good laughs at genuine 1972 prices. Mick is great in the first real acting role I&#39;ve ever seen him in, as is Judith Lucy and the rest of the cast, but then most of them have had a lot of practice... This is the best Australian comedy I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Go see it and learn the joys of Lawn Bowls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#39;S A BIT LIKE: Major League?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCORE: 8 / 10

Erotic cinema of the 1970&#39;s was tame compared to the triple X romps of today, which is good. Because there is a good story around the naked rituals and sex scenes. Of course, I wish that they had some vampire effects which they had at the time period and the sex did get in the way of the story a little. Plus some of the accents were hard to understand at time periods, but it&#39;s worth watching the unedited version then the edited up version which is titled THE DEVIL&#39;S PLAYTHING. But if you don&#39;t care for allot of naked women dancing and having sex, then this isn&#39;t the movie for you. However, I did enjoy it and I give it...7 STARS.

This film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the Vietnam War. As if, upon hearing some kids were doing without cheeseburgers in Cow Dung Collehe, the President was going to immediately change all US foreign policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst thing is that, while dangerous, the concept of a policy based on if the USSR and US went to war it could mean the end of the world, WORKED. The US and USSR NEVER WENT TO WAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had we only conventional weapons, the notion of yet another war, a &#34;win-able&#34; war, in Europe and Asia was not unthinkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I think they should get rid of this movie. It should be seen by film students as a splendid example of &#34;How NOT to make a film.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be 0 stars or maybe black holes...

My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section, but I couldn&#39;t find a place for it. I was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the U.S. in Feb., 1955. I saw it in a &#34;first run&#34; theater in Washington, D.C. in March, 1958. Wonder if it was re-released, or some problem? In my opinion, this movie is very light entertainment, but has some classic characters. John McIntyre does a bang-up job as a corrupt judge/entrepreneur/thief. Walter Brennan does basically the same role he did in Red River years earlier. And, in my opinion, James Stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did. I have seen this movie a half dozen times or more, and never tire of seeing parts of it again. The photography and scenery are splendid, and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes.

Perhaps one of the most overrated so-called horror classics ever made, Halloween does feature the memorable Michael Myers and some great acting by Jamie Lee Curtis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, its rewatchability factor is very close to zero, as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on dullness/culmination to the actual events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the sort of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it spawned so many sequels, I will never comprehend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God Rob Zombie is remaking this. And generally, I hate remakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely he will more than compensate for all the random time-filling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a movie we feel we have to like, much like the way we&#39;re taught that we SHOULD enjoy Dickens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t assume this is a classic.

my name is Heather and i am the girl whose story this movie was based on. I want to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it. as crude and harsh as some of the things that were depicted in this movie were, it didn&#39;t really even come close to describing how bad things actually were. not to mention the affect everything had on my mother and little sister. thanks once again for the great comments that everyone had,i truly appreciate them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Heather&#39;s mom. It&#39;s hard to believe that so many years have gone by since this movie was made. Harder even to believe that people were still watching it a year ago. For any of you out there who have gone thru the same or similar kind of situation, please know that there are people out here in cyberspace that do understand completely how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you.

I first saw this on Demand. Or on TV. I&#39;m not really sure. But this has got to be my all time favorite movie ever! I mean, this movie has blood, gore, laughs and chills through out the movie. I recently ordered &#34;Monster Man&#34; from Amazon and i&#39;ve been watching &#34;Monster Man&#34; ever since i got it. Trust me, you will love this movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The commentary on the DVD is way funny. They also said something about &#34;Monster Man 2&#34; during the commentary. Let&#39;s hope they make &#34;Monster Man 2&#34;! If you have the chance, rent the movie or buy it. You will absolutely LOVE it! This is the best movie that has come out in 2003.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10

I don&#39;t know what the Oscar voters saw in this movie, but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture Oscar. All I know is that fortunately there was Gene Kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as I believe it is. First of all, I don&#39;t think Leslie Caron was really fit to play such a role. She isn&#39;t that talented, she isn&#39;t a great dancer and she&#39;s not good looking at all. It&#39;s a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if Leslie Caron hadn&#39;t been in this, it might have made a terrific movie. The story was intelligent, the directing wasn&#39;t bad, and, as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I&#39;m not saying all this stuff about Leslie Caron just to criticize her, I&#39;m just saying it because I think that&#39;s what the worse part of the movie is. She&#39;s probably a good actress but I can&#39;t tell because I haven&#39;t seen her in anything else but I think she was pretty bad in &#34;An American in Paris&#34;. So if you want to see it, go ahead but I&#39;m telling you, you&#39;re way better off watching &#34;Singin&#39; in the rain&#34;.

Uh, oh! I just said the this &#34;classic&#34; film has a plot that STINKS! Well, it&#39;s true,...so get over it! This film was a vanity project for Joseph P. Kennedy in which his mistress starred and money flowed to make her an even bigger star. Today, only a fragmentary copy exists--one that was retored a few years back. However, even if the film had been in perfect shape, it STILL would have stunk for many reasons. And, without further ado, here are some of my reasons: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Gloria Swanson, aged 31 plays a girl in a convent school--perhaps aged 16 or 18! Come on--she looks old enough to be the mother of many of the kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the movie all hinges on the stupid concept of &#34;love at first sight&#34;. While some people believe it this, it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw away EVERYTHING on a woman he didn&#39;t even know! What a lot of hooey! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the movie is histrionic and the plot is nuts! After leaving the school, Kelly goes off to East Africa and then becomes &#34;Queen of the Whores&#34;--and later, after the evil queen back in Europe dies (that&#39;s convenient), the prince is able to get out of prison, actually finds Kelly and marries her and she then becomes queen of a real honest-to-goodness country! Gimme a break--this is RIDICULOUS, even in the days of silent film this plot was a groaner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, this is a poor film with great production values (mistresses need to LOOK good) that is parading around as a classic! There are so many BETTER silent films out there--see them first and avoid this tripe.

This is a documentary about homeless women. It was interesting in the sense that this focused on women who are engaged socially - having jobs and lasting friendships - but are in situations where they can not afford housing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found some of the women covered to be interesting, but there was little focus or progression in the story. The direction and editing failed to maintain my attention. There were differences in the stories of these women, of course, but the message was essentially the same and could have been told by focusing on any one of them in more depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made it to the end of the movie, but it was a rather boring journey.

I read ashew&#39;s comment and thought they must have been watching an entirely different picture! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just watched the film this morning and was quite surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address ashew&#39;s comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail Street is a very well done western.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Randolph Scott was in it quite a bit! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabby Hayes was funnier than I&#39;ve ever seen him! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad guys had very good comeuppances as far as I was concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was interesting to see Robert Ryan as a straight-laced good guy - he&#39;s usually so slimy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, a good western, very well acted and written.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the background story of Kansas and the &#34;winter wheat&#34; that supposedly helped it become a state, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the girl who played Susan was lovely - can&#39;t think why she didn&#39;t become a bigger star!

If you&#39;ve ever had a mad week-end out with your mates then you&#39;ll appreciate this film. Excellent fun and a laugh a minute.

The film is somewhat entertaining, but the greatest feature is Shalom Harlow&#39;s laughable performance. It has been 4 years since this movie was released and hopefully Harlow has gone through more training. Perhaps she should stick to the more worldly, somewhat corruptive characters that she has generated in other performances.

Are you kidding me? This is quite possibly the worst, amateur movie I&#39;ve ever seen. The casting was horrible, the acting was worse than horrible and I&#39;m sorry, the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing Drew around was nothing more than comical. When I herd about the Bell Witch, I wanted to believe. I read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story. But this movie just destroyed that. Ric White (Director, Writer, Lead Actor, etc) takes himself a bit too seriously and I think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves....Do yourself a favor....skip this one.

In a summer that also boasted such repugnant stinkers as Snakes on a Plane and The Da Vinci Code, that&#39;s a pretty bold statement. But I stand by it nonetheless. Superman Returns, like King Kong 6 months before it, is overlong, hyper-indulgent and with CGI up to the eyeballs. My God, this stuff is doing my head in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Donner had the idea of &#39;keep it real&#39; for his 2 outings. And I do find his approach to the special and optical effects to be the most appropriate. Brian Singer bombards us with so much CGI that it really takes you out of the story and constantly reminds you that you are watching a wannabe blockbuster that thinks that the only way to impress an audience is to spend $250 million (a totally irresponsible amount of money) on obnoxious visual effects that don&#39;t live up to the hype. We&#39;ve seen everything and been everywhere that CGI can take us. There&#39;s no real atmosphere or involvement in this. And for a film that is 95% made up of this crap...well you figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve read so many reviews from fanboy critics about how the movie has &#39;soul&#39; or &#39;a human heart&#39; or &#39;tender character moments&#39;. Puh-lease! We&#39;ve already had brooding superheros silently screaming &#39;you&#39;d love me if you knew who I am&#39; dozens of times already in recent years and SR offers absolutely NOTHING new in this regard. Even the plot is recycled garbage. Lex Luthor (a seriously mis-cast and hammy Kevin Spacey) plotting to destroy the landmass of America was done in the first film already! And, well...that&#39;s your lot! It&#39;s amazing that they managed to draw out this junk to 2.5 painful hours! Even if the cast were likable it would make it less unbearable. But Brandon Routh has the on screen personality of a mahogany hat-stand, Kate Bosworth is completely unconvincing as a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, James Marsden is 250% wooden, as usual and Kevin Spacey really needs to either fire his agent or acquire some better judgement. The only cast member I liked was the lovely Parker Posey. But I&#39;m into weird-looking girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year films like this get bigger and more bombastic. Pretty soon we&#39;ll have $300 million films. Studios need to realise that maybe they should start looking down instead of looking up. For all the money that Warner spent on this pile of crap, for all the resources that this movie cost to make...was it worth it? In my opinion, certainly not! This garbage has put me of Superman for life!

This is about as stupid as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A classic case of two-dimensional characters who always act exactly contrary as to what a sane person would do in the same situation. It reminds me of a scene in &#34;Scary Movie&#34; where Carmen Electra flees from the killer. There are two signs, one marked &#34;to safety&#34;, the other one &#34;to sure death&#34; (I am reciting from memory).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just like in Scary Movie, the characters always run into the direction marked &#34;Sure Death&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why oh why did the girl start the fire in the teller booth AND HOLD THE DOOR SHUT ??? Did she prefer to die in the fire instead being killed by the guy? Why oh why, after cutting and overpowering the driver did they sit him in the seat and have him being watched by the wounded guy instead of plain shooting him or at the very least knocking him out? He was running over their friend and killing him a minute before, yet they have scruples ?? Why oh why a hundred things more ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this movie were a road, you could not drive a single yard because of the holes. Everything is so far-fetched, it&#39;s starting to physically hurt at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add mercilessly overplaying &#34;actors&#34; and a small budget to that and here&#39;s what you get. Looking at the rating and the comments, I get the feeling those people have been watching an entirely different movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing missing really, is the infamous red toolbox from &#34;While She was out&#34; - a movie that is about similar in unrealistic plot and stupid behavior of the characters.

Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of that time, made films full of beautiful scenes, delicate love and with respect to all that is precious in life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays, if people should hear about him, they associate the name of Marischka with SISSI trilogy (1955,1956,1957). However, he made other excellent films like DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and definitely this one, MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN showing the young years of queen Victoria. Although it deals with a slightly different theme than SISSI films, I do not see many differences between this movie and SISSI. They are strikingly similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is almost identical. The style, the music, the photography. In fact, the crew are almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast... Romy Schneider&#39;s one of the first main roles. It was a lovely introduction to her role of Sissi since this film was made one year before the first part of the trilogy about the Austrian empress. It is also a film where Romy plays with her mother, Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director who cast Romy to play with her mum. Romy&#39;s debut, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953) was her performance with her mother, too. Therefore, there were some voices that Romy began her Austrian career on the bases of her mother&#39;s fame. Indeed, there is some truth in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, like in SISSI, this film shows love very gently. Victoria meets Prince Albert in a little inn in Dover. Their sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smiles. And now...? What would it be showed like? Only sex... But is it the only thing love is based on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful to Ernst Marischka for these movies. They had a soul and a message. Some people may call them kitschy, but I will never give up admiring these films. They are IMPRESSIVE!!! UNFORTUNATELY, HIGHLY UNDERRATED!

This film should be called adventures in Cinemascope. It is like the screenwriter and director tooks the Cliff&#39;s Notes page 3 outline and decided that this would be a great vehicle for a film about the Italian Alps. Rock Hudson is pretty good here, but the dialogue bears no resemblance to Hemingway at all. This is a made up version of Hemingway. Hecht, the screenwriter, is a hack. Watch the 1932 version with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. That is great cinema and was made by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in Northern Italy. Gary Cooper is very, very good compared to his performance in For Whom the Bell Tolls where he is stiff as a board and thinks he is in a western.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you are a Hemingway fan, do yourself a favor and do not watch this film. Your best bet is to get the unabridged audio CD and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written.

IT IS So Sad. Even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like Blood Lake, There&#39;s Nothing Out There &amp; . The music they play in this is the funniest stuff i&#39;ve ever heard. i like the brother and sister in this movie. They both don&#39;t try very hard to sound sarcastic when they&#39;re saying stuff like &#34;My friends are going to be so jealous!&#34; Hey, whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning? Thats retarded! I practically ignored the second half of this. My favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe. The same exact sound for every chop!

What was Steven Seagal thinking? I mean firstly I love Seagal. I love all his movies up to the mid 2000s. His early stuff is some of the best in the genre. This however does not live up to its excellent name. Attack Force (with protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) would be expected to be a mindless action movie with Seagal in typical one-liner ass kicking form. However, what we get is a crime mystery, bordering on a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in shadows because of his weight. I could not follow this story. There&#39;s people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug. What happened in this movie. The dubbing of Seagal is a disgrace, a shambles and a shame. Why dub the man? The story is terrible. This got a 2/10 from me because of the scene where Seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him, and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera! &#34;Revenge is a two way street&#34; seagal says in this movie...well forget revenge Steven, you need redemption!

This game was terrible. I think they worked too hard on the visuals and didn&#39;t do much with the gameplay, which is the most important part. I mean, the visuals look incredible, but is the game really &#34;fun&#34;? NO! I mean it&#39;s like &#34;hey let&#39;s jump off buildings&#34; and all I&#39;m doing is holding up and A/X. The game play just isn&#39;t there, and I don&#39;t agree with what Ubisoft did, because they had this hot girl (the producer of the game, Jade Raymond), and they were like &#34;OK we&#39;ve got this hot girl, let&#39;s pimp her&#34; and if you go to gaming websites, you&#39;re not gonna see gameplay stuff of Assassin&#39;s Creed, you&#39;ll see her face with a microphone and it&#39;ll be like &#34;We interviewed Jade Raymond about her favorite cookies!&#34; It&#39;s like man, shut the F*@K UP WHO CARES?! Apparently...a lot of people do, because they bought the game and like it...I mean compare this game with Super Mario Galaxy. A Wii game that really doesn&#39;t abuse the Wii Remote, but STILL is very innovative and delivers in the most important part, GAMEPLAY! They were able to do a bit of everything with Mario Galaxy, the graphics were still stunning, the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded amazing, and THAT&#39;S a game that deserves game of the year. NOT Assassin&#39;s Creed, man, it doesn&#39;t even deserve to even be a NOMINEE for Game of the Year. The hype around this game where it was like &#34;oh it&#39;s the next generation of gaming&#34;....really? I think not! So let me get this straight here, because I think the people liking this game are only liking it because they&#39;re Jade fans, so I&#39;ll tell you guys, JADE WILL NOT MAKE OUT WITH YOU OR ANYTHING IF YOU LOVE OR DEFEND THIS GAME! If you want a REAL game on the PS3, get Uncharted: Drake&#39;s Fortune, if you want a REAL game for the Xbox 360, get Call of Duty 4 (and a ton of other games too), and if you want a REAL game just in all the systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know this comment will be hated by many, but seriously, pressing two buttons for doing all this cool stuff, is that REALLY a fun game? The only reason why other games make it more complicated is because after it&#39;ll end up being more innovative and fun. And this game just isn&#39;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.3/10 A LIVING HELL!

***SPOILERS*** Seething with hatred and revenge half breed Zach Provo, James Coburn, had spent the last 11 years on a chain gang planing his escape. What Provo want&#39;s more then freedom is to even the score with the man who captured him and in the process, during a wild shootout, killed his Navajo wife: The former Pima County sheriff Sam Burgade, Charlton Heston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making his escape after killing two prison guards Provo makes his way towards Yuma knowing that that&#39;s not just where Burgade lives but where his his young daughter Susan, Barbara Hershey,resides as well. Using his fellow escaped convicts to lure Burgade into the vast Arizona Desert, by promising them $30,000.00 in gold coins that he buried there, Provo plans to exact his bloody vengeance on Burgade. But only after having him witness his daughter being brutally raped by his fellow convicts or are, in not being with a woman for years, as horny as a rabbit during mating season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brutal and very effective western that updates the John Wayne 1956 classic &#34;The Searchers&#34; in a father searching through dangerous Indian territory for his kidnapped daughter. Charlton Heston as the guilt-ridden Sam Burgade in his felling somehow responsible for killing Provo&#39;s wife and then having to face the fact that the same thing can very well happen to his daughter Susan is perfect in the role of the aging and retired sheriff. Charles Coburn as the vengeful half breed Zach Provo is also at his best as the obsessed with hatred and murder escaped convict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man who escaped with Provo are really not interest in his personal affairs but have no choice, in that he knows the territory like the back of his hand, but to go along with him. It&#39;s only the thought of them having their way with Susan, when Provo gives them the green light, as well as the buried $30,000.00 in gold coins that keeps them from breaking up and going their own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also going along with Burgade is Susan&#39;s boyfriend Hal Brickman, Chris Mitchum, who proves in the end that he&#39;s as good as Burgade is, who felt that he just didn&#39;t have it in him, in both tracking down the escaped criminals as well as using common sense, which in this case Burgade lacks, in doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***SPOILERS**** The unbelievably brutal and blood splattered showdown between Burgade and Provo is almost too much to sit through. Provo who&#39;s hatred of Burgade bordered on out right insanity wanted him to suffer a slow and excruciating death. it was that hatred that Bugrade took advantage of and, after taking some half dozen bullets, thus ended up putting the crazed and blood thirsty, as well as mindless, lunatic away for good!

Garlin did a great job. Nice concept well executed, and tightly produced. Came across as a very sincere story. As a fan of &#34;Curb Your Enthusiasm&#34;, where Jeff was pretty much the straight guy role, I was delighted with how much depth he brought to this role in a simple yet effective portrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of the humor was understated and subtle and drew on poignancy, which I really liked, rather than being slapstick or over-explained. And there were some nice little surprises and twists. The convenience store vignettes were a delight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I say it is a wonderful &#34;small&#34; film, I don&#39;t mean budget or quality. It is simple, intimate and hand-crafted. It tells a highly believable everyday story. Relax and go see it. Let it wash over you, and you will feel good for having done so.

I saw this on television more years ago than I can remember, but never forgot the performance of Sammy Davis, Jr. I just by chance thought to look for it on video. This rendition of Porgy and Bess is a treasure. I would love to see it again and introduce my son to it as well. I just can&#39;t imagine why it is not heralded as one of the greatest performances Sammy Davis, Jr. every gave. Whoever is responsible for not bringing this to audiences should be ashamed of his/her ignorance. I will continue to look for it though. Maybe the execs responsible for such things will come to realize the forgotten work of so many African American actors.

I had high hopes for this movie, because I enjoyed the book so much. However, I don&#39;t think I would have understood the premise of the movie if I hadn&#39;t already read the book. The movie is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of overpowering government rule, but the book portrays the suffering much more thoroughly. The corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, while the common people struggle to obtain the bare necessities for survival. Perhaps most people feel this way toward their leaders and rulers regardless of whether or not they are actually oppressed or repressed. Orwell&#39;s dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world. It has been several years since I&#39;ve read the book, but one hears references to Big Brother, the Thought Police, and Newspeak frequently in the media and casual conversation. Probably many people using these terms don&#39;t realize where the terms came from. I strongly recommend that you read the book.

This is easily the worst, most offensive piece of crap on TV. I&#39;d love to completely ignore it but Fox has stuck it into their Sunday lineup, forcing me to find something else to watch between American Dad and Family Guy. The dink-head male star guy is just about the least evolved, pathetic excuse for a human I have ever seen on TV. Nothing on the show is remotely funny and pretty much everything on it has been done already and much better by other shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s obvious that their strategy is to ram it deep and hard into the Sunday schedule and hope someone starts liking it... but I have to break it to ya, Fox, thats the wrong hole. The scam not worked on me - I simply look elsewhere - but come on, you freaking boneheads, this show freaking SUCKS, and it sucks even worse when compared to the rest of the Fox Sunday lineup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY CANCELLED ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT FOR THIS STEAMING PILE?

A very watchable film, and one which was eagerly awaited having seen the trailer a number of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing looks superb, from the ludicrous efforts of the effete upper class to distance themselves from the mediocrity, to the lower class scum just trying to keep their heads above the filth, the film captures the spirit of the 18th century brilliantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonny Lee Miller plays Maclean extremely well, though the part does not exactly stretch him, and Robert Carlyle seems a little wasted on Plunkett, Miller&#39;s highwayman colleague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real star of the show was undoubtedly Ken Stott, who plays Mr Chance (a kind of 1740&#39;s chief of police) with an evil glee that set him out from the rest of the cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great film, and anyone that enjoys the colour and style of Peter Greenaway&#39;s films will love the look of this, although the thinness of the plot becomes apparent before the 2 hours are up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth a viewing.

I&#39;m afraid this one is pretty dreadful, despite several good performances and generally competent acting-for-the-camera direction. It&#39;s a first and last attempt by writer-director Soo Lyu. &#34;Rub and Tug&#34; (2002) is one of the unfortunate by-products of Canada&#39;s program to promote home-grown film-making. While the program encourages worthwhile efforts like &#34;New Waterford Girl&#34; it opens the door for untalented novices like Lyu who did not have to aggressively pitch this project but was green-lighted without an adequate examination of her script or her credentials. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#39;t mind the low budget because the shabby production design, bad lighting, poor audio, and dreary docu-style shot selection is consistent with the subject matter; the workers in Canadian massage parlors. But the dialogue and the plotting doesn&#39;t give the actors anything to work with, the editor much to assemble, or a viewer any mental challenge other than suspension of disbelief. When your story is this simplistic the last thing you need is a muddled storytelling technique; even though nothing happens, the movie is hard to follow and point-of-view impossible to pin down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don McKellar&#39;s performance as Conrad is several notches below his similar characterization in &#34;Exotica&#34;. Lindy Booth&#39;s Lea is her standard quirky airhead; as always she is likable but here she is little else. Kira Clavell&#39;s Cindy is a pleasant surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role of any consequence, Tara Spencer-Nairn&#39;s street-wise Betty, more than cancels out her excellent performance in &#34;New Waterford Girl&#34;. Her shallow performance in &#34;Rub and Tug&#34; should curtail any tendency to seek out other films in which she has appeared; unless you need further confirmation of &#34;Waterford&#34; director Alan Moyle&#39;s skill in working with young actors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You quickly conclude that Lyu&#39;s reptilian brain cannot grasp concepts like plot complexity, so the need to insert a lazy and lame &#34;deus ex machina&#34; device toward the end is hardly a surprise. Still it could be worse, the listless story has so little internal logic anyway that the unlikely ending is not as painful as would normally be the case. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, what do I know? I&#39;m only a child.

Pointless boring film with charismatic Mercurio completely wasted. Released for a minute on a Thursday in maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of Sydney except me and four others BACK OF BEYOND is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a fee. Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (well Polson has morphed into a Director of lame thrillers like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Terry Serio seems never to get a guernsey apart from thug roles. But Paul Mercurio should have become one of Australia&#39;s greatest exports on screen. Roles like this are major disappointments and films like this are just a waste of talent and time.

I LOVED this program, and for years searched for it on video. I&#39;ve contacted a great many folks in my attempts to get a copy...to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO, however, have the second half of the program. I would be willing to share MY half, with anyone who can give me a copy of the FIRST half of this show. I&#39;d offer to provide copies of what I have to anyone, BUT it&#39;s just only part of the program...so it&#39;s just not an adequate representation of the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few folks selling this on EBAY for some incredible cost (and that&#39;s plainly not fair...not to mention blatant copyright violations!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please send any correspondence to: thndrmouse@aol.com

This is a tepid docu-drama that covers no new ground, reworks all the cliches and is sloppy with facts. For example, Munich is a very flat city. So why is it hilly in the movie? For example, the end of the Great War in 1918 was not a surrender but an armistice. Yet it is announced as a surrender. For example, European news vendors did not (and do not) shout headlines as they hawk their papers. Yet this strictly American custom is employed in the film. For example, the Nazis did not adopt the German eagle until after they had taken power but there it is on the lectern as Hitler delivers one of his stem winders. Indeed, most of this disappointing production consists of little more than Hitlerian oratory. The movie also perpetuates the myth that the beer hall putsch was hatched at the Munich Hoffbrauhaus. It was not. Robert Carlyle does a fine portrayal of his subject. But his supporting cast is adequate at best and very often not even that. These comments are based on the first episode only. One only can hope the second will be better but don&#39;t bet on it.

especially when looking at the amount of crap that has made it to DVD. I found this movie very funny. Rip Torn is classic with his barbs; Rob Schneider if hilariously annoying as the over-compensating Ensign; Bruce Dern makes a great &#34;villain&#34;. The entire cast seems to be having a blast, and it&#39;s not at the expense of the audience. If you like just plain fun comedy, and aren&#39;t looking too deeply into meaning, you just might fall in love with this one.

Saw this at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a Q&amp;A afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it hard to believe this is a first time director and all kudos to Harvey Keitel for once again taking a risk and going out on a limb for a script he liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso, it tells the story of the young director on the turning of the revolution in Cuba. However, don&#39;t expect this to be a movie about the revolution, it&#39;s political stance is wonderfully ambiguous. Many references to the directors obvious love of film history (a great &#34;Bicycle Thief&#34; homage&#34;) and some whimsical scenes which work with out being pretentious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!

Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) a movie about &#34;yokai&#34; or traditional Japanese &#34;monsters&#34; of folklore. It is alternatively known as Big Monster War or as Ghosts on Parade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak, kappa water imp, a living &#39;brella, a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic, a woman with a second face on the back of her head, a dwarf priest with an enormous gourd-like wrist, &amp; so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore, but from a type of summer entertainment of the Tokugawa Era, comparable to today&#39;s Halloween haunted houses, or the &#34;freak shows&#34; of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks. Ghosts &amp; goldfish monsters &amp; dancing one-headed umbrellas were trumped up to create &#34;chills&#34; during the hot summers. The fatcheek woman &amp; such were recreated by tricks or illusions, based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls; &amp; if their design for the movie is a bit simple &amp; hoky, this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These rather endearing monsters have to face off &amp; destroy an ancient Babylonian vampire demon who has come to Japan &amp; disguised himself as a samurai lord. Despite that some of the Japanese apparitions are a bit goofy, &amp; too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak, it is all played very poker-faced &amp; is very charming. It has some beautiful cinematography, much as would be provided in a CGI film of the same decade. Viewed in the right mood or with the right friends, it is exciting, moving &amp; touching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famed Lone Wolf &amp; Cub: White Heaven &amp; Hell (1974) &amp;and was the special FX director for the excellent Daimajin trilogy. The Yokai Monsters series is not the equal of Majin at its best, but the Yokai are nevertheless great fun. The first miike movie which is the most child-oriented of his family films, with the GOZU &amp; IZOO consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers.

It&#39;s one of the imponderables of low-budget independent film-making that so many with so little in the way of real talent fancy themselves frightmeisters. The paucity of talent evinced by these wonky wannabees is there for all the world to see. Case in point: FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (or, as I quickly came to know it, SHITE OF THE LIVING DEAD). There&#39;s nothing wrong with paying homage to one&#39;s heroes. I&#39;ve done it many times over the years, myself, in many different ways. In fact, in the xlibris book THE NIGHT RIDERS, co-written with M. Kelley, I dedicate it, in part, to &#34;the six writers whose work inspires me still: Richard Matheson, Harlan Ellison, Shirley Jackson, Edgar Allen Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, and Robert E. Howard.&#34; Had it been a motion picture, I would&#39;ve dedicated it to the directors whose films have inspired me over the years. Very high up on that list would&#39;ve been George Romero. It&#39;s nothing less than a crying shame that the makers of this film weren&#39;t truly as inspired by Romero as their title suggests.

Did I step in something or is that bad smell coming from Daybreak 1 + 2? God was behind everything? What has God got to do with Sci-Fi? God is only the answer when you can&#39;t think up a sensible explanation for something. In fact, this is exactly the problem with the series finale - they obviously couldn&#39;t think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how Kara Thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper, how her old viper and charred body ended up on Earth 2, why Baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head, why 6 has an imaginary Baltar in her head, etc. so they explain it with &#34;angels&#34; or just don&#39;t explain it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a Basestar through. For example, why does Galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl (Hera), particularly after Adama said there was no way he&#39;d attempt a rescue? Because they found out the location of the Cylon base? That&#39;s not a good reason to sacrifice the crew&#39;s lives. And how did Anders know the location? And what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters&#39; lives before the war? It&#39;s like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series. Feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical Christians on a mission to spread &#39;The Word&#39;. Forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot, the important message the writers wanted to get across is: don&#39;t put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction; God is your ultimate salvation (tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine in the final movie of the Star Wars series they tell you there is no &#34;force&#34;... instead, a Jedi actually gets his power from Jesus. Then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the Ewoks. Would this be a good ending? No it frakken&#39; wouldn&#39;t.

DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE (1 outta 5 stars)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dreadful, dreadful movie... based on the pulp magazine/paperback series by Lester Dent/Kenneth Robeson... about a super-heroic adventure hero in the &#39;30s and his five assistants, all experts in some field of endeavor that allows them to combat evil. It was a pretty hokey series... but kinda fun to read when I was a teenager. I knew they made a movie version in the &#39;70s, starring Ron (Tarzan) Ely... but I never got a chance to see it. It never played in theaters where I lived and was never shown on TV. Now that I have finally seen the film I can understand why. The plot and characters are never treated seriously... it&#39;s all kind of tongue-in-cheek and campy... kind of like the old Batman TV series... only without the benefit of being funny... or having any visual flair. Corny dialogue, cheesy special effects, dumb stereotypes, crummy action scenes and bad, bad acting. Actually, I find it kind of fascinating in its badness... what could they have possibly been thinking? Arnold Schwarzenegger was rumoured to be starring in a modern-day remake... but I don&#39;t imagine that would have turned out to be much better.

jim carrey can do anything. i thought this was going to be some dumb childish movie, and it TOTALLY was not. it was so incredibly funny for EVERYONE, adults &amp; kids. i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres, and now it&#39;s FINALLY coming out on DVD this tuesday and i&#39;m way to excited, as you can see. you should definitely see it if you haven&#39;t already, it was so great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liz

About five years ago, my friend and I went to the video rental store to get something to watch. My friend saw Space Truckers on the shelf, and so we got it. Once we got home and started watching it, we realized what an absolute piece of crap it was! A beer can floating in space? A guy taking a dump in a toilet? A guy with a mechanical dick who tries to arouse a women by saying, &#34;Whizz, whizz!&#34;? WTF!!! The dumbest, stupidest, most retarded, horribly throne together piece of trash my eyes have ever been exposed to. My friend and I still refer to it as THE worst movie we have ever seen. Only one other movie has come close to its crappiness (and that would be the stupid Jackie Chan flick, &#34;The Medalion&#34;). If you eyes ever see this piece of junk on the shelf at your video store, proceed to do the following: 1. Take it off the shelf and throw it to the ground. 2. Stomp on it for at least 30 seconds. 3. Proceed to set it on fire in a contained facility (bathroom stall). 4. Lastly, take it to your local hazardous waste management facility immediately so that it may be properly dealt with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY FROM &#34;SPACE TRUCKERS&#34;!!!!!!!!

This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pino&#39;s hot-headed character would have been transferred to the &#34;rubber gun squad&#34; years ago. The whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007. Every Vietnam veteran character they&#39;ve ever had has turned out to be the killer, unless it was another Vietnam veteran. There has only been one black murderer, and he was put up to it by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a &#34;race traitor&#34; who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey,screenwriters: minorities and poor people commit murder too. Only on this show are most murderers upper-class whites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No real-life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. The state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won&#39;t serve a day. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost DA&#39;s careers.

Eva (Hedy Lamarr) has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon, she realizes that her husband does not desire her. Her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love, makes Eva returning to her father&#39;s home in a farm, leaving her husband. One afternoon, while bathing in a lake, her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to Eva. They fall in love for each other and become lovers. Later, her husband misses her and tries to have Eva back home. Eva refuses, and fortune leads the trio to the same place, ending the affair in a tragic way. I have just watched &#34;Extase&#34; for the first time, and the first remark I have is relative to the horrible quality of the VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network: the movie has only 75 minutes running time, and it seems that it was used different reels of film. There are some parts totally damaged, and other parts very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images in not achieved by the Brazilian viewer, if he has a chance to find this rare VHS in a rental or for sale. The film is practically a silent movie, the story is very dated and has only a few lines. Consequently, the characters are badly developed. However, this movie is also very daring, with the exposure of Hedy Lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers, symbolizing the intercourse between Eva and her lover. The way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of Eva is very clear. The non-conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie. I liked this movie, but I hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version. My vote is eight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;Êxtase&#34; (&#34;Ecstasy&#34;)

This was yet another big screen outing for a US TV show from the sixties It is amusing enough but was very much to formula. Intelligent Martian lands on Earth and meets the not too bright humans, in his view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The usual wackiness ensues with the human, Bridges, eventually bonds with him and helps him to get home. Along the way he also gets the girl, Hannah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice outing for some pleasant Hollywood stars who I had not seen for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant enough to pass some spare time if you have not got anything better to view.

This movie is a real gem. The arc of the the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, their motives completely believable. The dialogue is fresh, and oh so real. The situations are unique to the characters and not at all cliched or hackneyed. Until the climax, that is. Then it&#39;s as if the movie went off the rails a bit and it got a bit hokey and unbelievable. But I don&#39;t want to discourage people from watching this film. The first 3/4&#39;s of it are truly remarkable. I gave it an 8. There are some remarkable performances here. Check out this movie.

This is one irresistible great cheerful- and technically greatly made movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie features some of the greatest looking sets you&#39;ll ever see in a &#39;30&#39;s movie, even though it&#39;s all too obvious that they are sets, rather than real place locations. Often if a character would fall or shake a doorpost too aggressive, the entire set would obviously move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best moments of the movie were the silent, more old fashioned, slapstick kind of moments. It shows that René Clair&#39;s true heart was at silent movie-making. The overall humor is really great in this movie. Also of course the musical moments were more than great. This is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early French musical. Though the best moments are the silent moments, that does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialog, that gets very well delivered by the main actors, who all seemed like stage actors to me, which in this case worked extremely well for the movie its overall style and pleasant no-worries atmosphere. No wonder this worked out so well, since this movie is actually based on stage play by Georges Berr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a technical really great movie, with also some great innovation camera-work in it and some really great editing, that create some fast going and pleasant to watch enjoyable sequences. There is never a dull moment in this movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;René Clair was such a clever director, who knew how to build up and plan comical moments within in movies. It&#39;s a very creative made movie, that despite its simplicity still at all times feel as a totally original and cleverly constructed movie, that never seizes to entertain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last half hour is especially unforgettably fun, without spoiling too much, and is really among the greatest, as well as most creative moments in early comedy film-making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters, who are of course all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks. It all adds to the pleasant light comical atmosphere and cuteness of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most pleasant movies you&#39;ll ever see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10

The 3 stars are for Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Nothing else and no one else in this movie deserves even a wee smidgen of a star. Well, OK, Amy Adams deserves a wee smidgen, but the smidgenometer doesn&#39;t seem to be working, so I&#39;ll stick with 3. Tom Hanks...nothing. Julia Roberts...nothing. Mike Nichols...do you see a trend yet? Aaron Sorkin...OMG, not a chance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could rant on for several paragraphs about the way Charlie Wilson&#39;s War glosses over history, morality, legitimacy and so on, but I don&#39;t think any such rant could outweigh the gushing of Aaron Sorkin fans. The rest of you, beware.Spend your movie money elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, if you&#39;re looking for a pithy comment, here&#39;s mine. You can put hot fudge sauce on a pile of garbage, but it changes nothing. Garbage is garbage and so is Charlie Wilson&#39;s War.

This is one of those &#34;so bad it is good&#34; films that you always hear about but never see! Unlike Troma films which are deliberately bad and campy (and I am not amused) this one is 100% pure serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However with features such as a supposedly super-lethal killer robot that prances about like one of the Solid Gold Dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the Good Witch of the East the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watcheable enough because of that.

I had heard (and read) so many good things about Weeds that I was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable Series (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men) but that slowly eroded away with each episode I watched from Season One. (didn&#39;t make it past the first six episodes) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing was unoriginal, contrived and the portrayal of Blacks embarrassing. The dialog felt forced, like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip . It was a rare moment when I actually emitted an audible laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters never developed enough for me to care about them, they were selfish and unappealing. I absolutely HATED the addition of the Brother-in-law (who should have been hauled away on To Catch A Predator) and the removal of the Hodes&#39; daughter Quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in Mexico was so unoriginal and cliché, I had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer&#39;s loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Episode after episode I liked the characters less and couldn&#39;t get past many of the technical flaws in the story line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to that I heard that Season Two wasn&#39;t as good, so I lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re a fan of good casting and writing, I suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like, unless of course you&#39;re stoned and then all bets are off.

I feel like I&#39;ve just watched a snuff film....a beautifully acted, taut, engrossing and horrible thing! A two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, live burial, and abuse, abuse, abuse. No redemption whatsoever. And I WAS entertained. I couldn&#39;t stop watching. What does this say about me, about the people who make and act in this sort of thing, and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm. And I&#39;m neither puritanical nor humorless, I don&#39;t try to hide from the existence of darkness, and I definitely have not led a sheltered life, but I am ashamed of myself. AND I&#39;m sorry to see my British cousins dragging the subject-matter sewers the way my own tribe does. It doesn&#39;t have to be cozy, but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism?

The short that starts this film is the true footage of a guy named Gary, apparently it was taken randomly in the parking lot of a television station where Gary works in the town of Beaver. Gary is a little &#34;different&#34;; he is an impersonator and drives an old Chevy named Farrah (after Fawcett). Lo and behold the filmmaker gets a letter from Gary some time later inviting him to return to Beaver to get some footage of the local talent contest he has put together, including Gary&#39;s staggering performace as Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh, my. The two shorts that follow are Gary&#39;s story, the same one you just witnessed only the first is portrayed by Sean Penn and the second by Crispin Glover titled &#34;The Orkly Kid.&#34; If you are in the mood for making fun of someone this is definitely the film to watch. I was doubled over with laughter through most of it, especially Crispins performance which could definitely stand on it&#39;s own. When it was over, I had to rewind the film to once again watch the real Gary and all his shining idiocy. Although Olivia was the focus, I would have liked to have seen one of the &#34;fictitious&#34; shorts take a jab at Gary&#39;s Barry Manilow impersonation, whic h was equally ridiculous.

There are movies, and there are films. Movies are more often than not merely cinematic &#34;candy,&#34; whereas films are true works of art. Fraulein Doktor is certainly well-placed in the latter. As most viewers, I was highly impressed with the battle scenes, but the poignancy of the portrayal of the central character is what I consider to be the most sterling quality of the film. Having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of Deutschland, all the while in the throes of morphine addiction, die Fraulein is treated very shabbily by the German high command despite all of her efforts. The scene in which the Doktor is being conveyed in the rear seat of a Mercedes Benz command auto, alone, desolate, and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest yet truest depictions of a &#34;spy&#39;s&#34; lot in life. Only the emotional pain presented by Richard Burton in the Spy Who Came in from the Cold comes close. Fraulein Doktor is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a singular viewing. I only wish that its producers would see fit to release it on DVD so that those who have never experienced it can, and those who have seen it can again (perhaps again and again)enjoy this exceptional motion picture.

What a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be. This is the type of film that I&#39;ve been looking for ages. Particularly important for me was the fantastic-looking Chicago, which I still keep thinking about. The back cover doesn&#39;t do this film justice, it&#39;s superb, and in my top-5 for sure.

It&#39;s a good movie maybe I like it because it was filmed here in PR. The actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome! The guy is cute too so it&#39;s a good match if you want to the guy or the girls.

Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This zany romp of a film revolves around the 80&#39;s culture of Heavy Metal and horror movies--two things which I love dearly. So, as you can imagine, this movie appealed to me pretty easily. Plus, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is about an unpopular high school youth who, like all us losers, ended up drenched in a world of &#34;evil&#34; Heavy Metal. His favorite Metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected--by playing his latest unreleased album backwards. This allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and sh*t helping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, it&#39;s pretty cheesy at times, but you know what? It&#39;s got a surprising number of good qualities. Decent acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very brief nudity, decent atmosphere... All in all, it&#39;s actually a decent horror film. But what really sucks is the music. Ironic, huh? Well, this &#34;uber-evil&#34; Metal guy is one of the most obnoxious, high-pitched, wailing, Motley Crue rejects on the planet--and the &#34;Metal&#34; is little more than putrid 80&#39;s Pop/Hair Metal. He hits all the cliché&#39;s here, from prancing around like a gay fairy, to looking mean, to screaming &#34;Rock and Roll!!!&#34; in a pitch high enough to make King Diamond retch. Aside from that atrocious musical representation, it&#39;s actually pretty good. 7/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.ResidentHazard.com

The idea for the movie wasn&#39;t too bad: a horror film shot in a corn maze on Halloween. The bad part was the shoddy camera work, the ten million shots of puddles and corn, and the hour and a half long walk this guy took in the maze. Oh, I&#39;m sorry, the &#34;maize.&#34; I picked up this movie because it reminded me of a corn maze near where I live, and I thought it was a cool idea for a movie. But taking everything into consideration, it seems that your average Joe could take the same idea and run much further with it. Bill Cowell&#39;s acting wasn&#39;t too bad, in fact, I would say it was pretty good. But the lack of talent from his co-stars didn&#39;t help his efforts. Here&#39;s to hoping his next movie will be easier to swallow.

While I have never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (due to its horrid production values), it appears like Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by Hanna-Barbera! Without a doubt, Scrappy-Doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children (and this includes the Teletubbies as well as Tommy the Tapeworm). Whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the Scooby-Doo characters with it?! Whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny, annoying and grates on the nerves--and this is only in the BETTER episodes!! After many years, it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess! I can see why in the live-action Scooby-Doo movie they made the villain Scrappy-Doo--since practically everyone hates him!

I enjoyed the first reviewer&#39;s comment far more than I did the film when I saw it at a second-run theatre in the early &#39;80&#39;s. I was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the Tenniel drawings. But to me, the cast was largely squandered, their personalities muffled by the masks, while the direction I think of as being unusually static, and the photography murky. The rating jotted down at the time was a nought, which means &#34;not worth sitting through even once&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I too would jump at a chance to have a second look.

&#34;Shade&#34; tries hard to be another &#34;Sting&#34;, substituting poker for horse racing as the means by which to bring down an enemy, but it fails miserably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched the whole thing and still never could quite understand why the young kid wanted to double-cross his partner. Was it because his partner stole his girl? Is there a woman in the world who is worth going to that much trouble over? If there is, it certainly wasn&#39;t this shrew. She had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and really now, did she actually have a special room set up so that a surgeon could remove the kidney from whoever tried to pick her up in a bar? Dina Merrill makes a short appearance as a rich woman who hosts, of all things, pay-the-rent poker parties at her palatial home. And then the players say things like, &#34;I&#39;ll see your thousand and raise you another five thousand.&#34; Give me a break. You can&#39;t call (&#34;see&#34;) and raise, you do one or the other. Any kid playing for nickels and dimes at the kitchen table knows this; you&#39;d think grown men playing for stakes this high -- or at least the knuckleheads who wrote the script -- would know it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the other posters mentioned how no high-limit poker game would allow players to actually deal their own cards and I agree. You don&#39;t allow two of the best-known car cheats into a game where the buy-in is $250,000 and then let them deal to each other. That&#39;s not poker; that&#39;s just seeing which one can cheat better. And I&#39;d like to know what person in his right mind would buy in to a game in which two of the best-known card cheats are playing and expect that he might have a chance at winning? And most of all, what Mafia boss would run such a game? Every time Melanie Griffith came on the screen I was so mesmerized by those gigantic fluorescent red lips of hers that I completely lost the storyline, and seeing her and Stallone together was more like a public service announcement for plastic surgery gone wrong than a love connection. Stallone mentions that she used to be a grifter before she bought the restaurant she now runs, but we don&#39;t know what kind of grifter she was and we never see her working with Stallone in their younger days so we are left to wonder, if we even care that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie Foxx is the best character in the whole movie, but he gets killed off right off the bat and we&#39;re left with cardboard cut-outs who all sound like they&#39;re reading their lines off a teleprompter just off-camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending makes no sense either. The kid gets his cut from the game and just walks down the street with a briefcase full of money and his partner is nowhere to be seen? The Mafia isn&#39;t watching every move he makes? Everyone else just shrugs their shoulders and quietly accepts the loss of millions of dollars without trying to recoup any of it? I don&#39;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, this movie does a great injustice to professional poker players all over the world, insinuating that the only way to win is by palming cards and playing with &#34;juiced&#34; decks. And why is it they&#39;re always palming kings and aces? Sometimes you need a three or a nine to fill a straight or full house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best parts of the whole film are the sleight-of-hand tricks during the beginning and ending credits; everything in between is ridiculous.

I saw this Film one midnight and I can say that it worse than other horror film about a Haunted House.Alexandra Paul is not one of the best actress but she can do the role better,The little girl get worse this is a example about a Bad actress,she has not got future in the great world of films. SENTENCE FOR HOUSE OF THE DAMNED:BAD

Now this is a real turkey by the overrated director Franco, who gave us such classics as &#34;Las Vampiras/Vampyros Lesbos&#34;. Yes, I think that bad films can be great fun. I adore the hilarious howlers of Doris Wishman, Dwain Esper and Ed Wood jr., but this one proved to be too much for me. It is the first film I rated 1. Where should I start? The screenplay is idiotic to the utmost. The dialogue is unbelievably bad. The directing seems to be nonexistent. The best music cue (used repeatedly in this film) was taken directly from the movie &#34;Der Hexer&#34; (1964). And it&#39;s BORING! Poor Shirley Eaton and George Sanders! In one shot Sanders reads a Popeye comic while his henchman torture a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this movie). The only thing that baffled me was that Franco promptly showed female nudity whenever I thought the movie would gain from it - this is real directing skill! Still, I&#39;m afraid that a movie in which actors pretend to shoot with machine guns by shaking them is not really worthwhile.

In the Old west there are always the men who live breathe violence and the women who hold their breath. A famous ¨town tamer¨ named Clit Tollinger(Robert Mitchum) comes hired by the citizens to rid the gunslingers ( Leo Genn, Claude Atkins, among others), Baronland&#39;s hoodlums. There he meets the blacksmith (Emile Meyer) , his daughter (Karen Sharpe), her boyfriend(John Lupton), the marshal(Henry Hull) and the Saloon owner (Ted De Corsia). Clint as lawman is appointed deputy to bring peace and puts some cartels saying the following : ¨ Warning , wearing of guns or other weapons in town is banned. Check all hardware at the marshal&#39;s office ¨. Clint finds his ex-girlfriend, a local madame (Jan Sterling) in charge of the Saloon girls( Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence, among them). But the town council afraid the raw methods carried out by Clint . At the end the kingpin landowner appears and attempts to murder Tollinger with his own hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tremendously exciting story of a sheriff-for-hire who had only one more killing to go. It begins as a slow-moving Western but follows to surprise us with dark characters and solid plot. The tale is almost grim , a pacifier comes to a town just in time to make sure its citizenry but later the events get worse . The highlights are the burning at Saloon and the climatic showdown at the ending. Phenomenal and great role for Robert Mitchum as avenger angel and bitter gunfighter, he&#39;s the whole show. Vivid and lively musical score by Alex North (Spartacus, Cleopatra), Atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Lee Garmes. The motion picture is stunningly realized by Richard Wilson (Al Capone , Three in Attic) who made good Western as ¨Invitation to a gunfighter and ¨Zane Grey¨ episodes. Watchable results for this offbeat Western.

George Hilton never really grabs me like Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood, but this is a great outing for him. Basically rippin off the Django/man With No Name and doing a damn good job. The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch. Fans of the genre will be in heaven.

OK,but does that make this a good movie?well,not really,in my opinion.there isn&#39;t a whole lot to recommend it.i found it very slow,tediously,in fact.it&#39;s also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable,but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times,which i didn&#39;t really think fits this series and the character.Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he&#39;s a decent enough actor,but i felt he played his character too over the top.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie,which would have been great if i had liked the movie.plus,there were some pretty bad one liners.Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role,but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has not really evolved,as i had hoped.oh well.this is just my opinion.anyway,for me,while this movie is not abysmal,it is pretty bad.my vote for Darkman III: 3.5/5

Ya know what? Family Guy started out as something fresh, funny and more original. The random humor USED to be funny. I actually used to think it was the best animated sitcom next to The Simpsons. After watching the new episodes that aired for the past few weeks; I grew fed up with the show relying too much on random humor to be funny. South Park was right about FG dead on when they brought up the Manatees and the idea balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And watching the show itself, I don&#39;t understand why my parents like it so much; there&#39;s nothing great about it. The &#34;Intellegent&#34; humor is funny and would&#39;ve been funnier if the show didn&#39;t rely on randomness.

OK..... This is the third in the series of carnosaur. Lets star with the dinosaur puppets! In the start of the film you cant See the Dino&#39;s cause when the body count starts you can only See the Dino&#39;s eye vision, pretty smart to hide the bad puppets! and maybe in 16 minutes forward on the film some special force team with Scott Valentine as the leader Rance, the team walks into the warehouse and then they begins to find body parts and dead body&#39;s after the Dino rampage, after a while some big box comes failing on the team and you can hear a velociraptor scream, pretty creepy!!! and then a black girl walks forward and now one blooper is found! It pops up a raptor hand and slashed her face but if you pause when the raptor hand comes you can See that its just a guy with a hand puppet!? WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorist&#39;s attacks some truck cause they though It wash some weapons in there. 2. They where dead wrong it seams to be ten tons raptor and one giant t-Rex in there! How did the t-Rex fit in there??? 3. Rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs! Sadly some stupid blond girl told him to capture one of them alive=( 4. Holy Jesues the raptors have wheels on their feats! 5. The Dino&#39;s is now on a boat in the pacific. 6: Strange i didn&#39;t know that the t-Rex had a strange thing on hes neck??? 7. THE END. The film is good if you want a good laugh. 5/10

This film was set, filmed, and premiered in Oxford, Miss., the hometown of W. Faulkner, the locale of the 1948 book. Most of the extras were locals. I&#39;ve been to Oxford, and it has greatly changed. This film features Will Geer as the sheriff;he was later blacklisted. It was the writers and actors of social dramas such as this film, and Grapes Of Wrath, that were targets of the HUAC a few years later. I don&#39;t recall if the actor playing the young Mallison boy (Claude Jarman Jr) did anything after the TV series Centennial (1978), but he was terrific in this earlier film. And do not miss Elizabeth Patterson who later played in Little Women.

The worst movie i&#39;ve ever seen. I still don&#39;t understand what Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen intend to do in. Maybe they had bills to pay... The best and cult part happens during a flashback which brings us during WWII when a Nazi officer hide his Jewish wife. That&#39;s the beginning of a typical serial killer life! It seems to be directed during the beginning of the 80&#39;s but then appears a New Beattle... Amazing! This movie was directed in 2001... I&#39;m quite sure that it took less than two weeks to do that movie. I heard that Dennis Hopper&#39;s wife asked for divorce after she saw that picture and Michael Madsen&#39;s mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to be the man under the yellow baseball hat. Pathetic!

This movie is yet another in the long line of no budget, no effort, no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to know what watching this movie is like, grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and &#34;attacking&#34; people. Congratulations, you&#39;ve just made &#34;Hood of the Living Dead&#34;! Now see if a distribution company will buy it from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some low budget, shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort, but this has neither. Avoid unless you are a true masochist or are amused by poorly made horror movies.

Chang Cheh&#39;s &#34;Shaolin Temple&#34; might very well be the highwater mark of the Shaw Brothers martial arts film cycle. This rousing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast - a veritable who&#39;s who of the Shaw stable. Though the plot is fairly standard and the fight choreography is superb as usual, it is Cheh&#39;s handling of the subject matter that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable. The sense of reverence displayed for the history and traditions of the Shaolin Temple is palpable in every frame. Not unlike William Keighley&#39;s paean to the fabled Fighting 69th in that same self titled film or John Ford&#39;s salute to West Point in &#34;The Long Gray Line,&#34; Cheh&#39;s &#34;Shaolin Temple&#34; is a lovingly crafted ode in that same style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cultural correlation I am tempted to make, is to compare the Shaolin Temple to the Alamo. Watching this film will give the same admiring and nostalgic feelings that you experienced many years ago in grade school history when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those doomed heroes of the Alamo. At the end of the film, you too might be tempted to call out, Remember the Shaolin Temple!

Since Wesley Snipes descended(or Ascended)to the world of DTV action movies the result has been Miss,so-so,and miss.Unstoppible was weak.7 seconds was entertaining.The marksman was the proverbial scraping of the septic tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what of The Detonator?We&#39;ll anything would be above suffering the Marksman again.But the Detonator holds a small amount of merit that is hampered by a lazy star and Low budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonny Griffith is a not-so-by-the-book Covert op who busts illegal arms dealers in Poland.When his latest assignment ends up a bullet-buffet leaving a pile of bodies;Sonny then is ordered to escort a witness; Nadia (the ever-hot Silvia Colloca) to the US.Trouble is; Sonny is being duped by a traitor in his own organization who is keeping his trail hot for Gangsters with Nuclier Ambitions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snipes delivers in the action department.He is in half-blade mode here.He actually does well in the first 15 minutes of the Detonator,before descending into pure sleepwalking mode that ruined the Marksman.Colloca does more than look pretty.There is some conviction to her scenes.A lot of the actors look familiar,and have been in the last 3 or 4 Seagal/Snipes movies.Its always good to see Michael Brandon again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action is telegraphed here.But never boring.Running,car chases,Fights.Director Po-Chih Leong seems to have gotten better after the Seagal farce;Out of Reach.He does a credible job.But is constantly hampered by the low budget.Enough with the eastern Euro-locations.Its cheapening the movie&#39;s look.Vancover cannot be that much expensive can it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Detonator ends just average.It does not have the so-bad its fun aspect of Seagal&#39; Mercenary for Justice. But it is nowhere near as entertaining as Van Damme&#39;s Second in command.Nor as thrilling as Dolph&#39;s Mechanik.Perhaps Dolph should direct Wesley next eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its high time The producers pump a little more money and thought into these DTV titles with the kind of money they are making from them.Its only fair.The result could be a high seller perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snipes would be advised to try making this one his last DTV action flick.Its sad to see YET another waste of this gifted actor&#39;s Talents.

I was so surprised when I saw this film so much underrated... I understand why some of you dislike this movie. Its pace is slow, a characteristic of Japanese films. Nevertheless, if you are absorbed in the film like me, you will find this not a problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say this is the best comedy I have ever seen. &#34;Shall We Dansu?&#34; is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It is very different from Hollywood ones, e.g. Austin Powers or Scary Movies, in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes. Rather, it is light-hearted, a movie that makes you feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the movie because it makes me feel &#34;real&#34;. The plot is straightforward yet pleasing. I was so delighted seeing that Sugiyama (the main role) has found the meaning of life in dancing. Before I watched the film I was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork. I felt lost. However, this film made me think of the bright side of life. I believed I was in the same boat of Sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why couldn&#39;t I? It reminded me of &#34;exploring my own future&#34; and discovering the happiness in my daily life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect, I kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really &#34;alive&#34;, learning to dance as the film goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, this film is encouraging and heart-warming. As a comedy, it does its job perfectly. It definitely deserves 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes Aoki is funny :-D

The Hindi remake of Mrs Doubtfire starring and directed by Kamal Hassan is a somewhat shoddy version, and not as good as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kamal Hassan clearly struggles with Hindi dialogs, even after all these years, and cannot handle even one scene effortlessly. The guy has aged and should give it a rest. Hassan doesn&#39;t bring anything new to the role or to the character as say, Dustin Hoffman does to Tootsie, or Marathi actor Macchindranath Kambli does to Mavshi&#39;s (aunt&#39;s) character in &#34;Moruchi Mavshi&#34; (Moru&#39;s Auntie, comedy play).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was the kid doing playing with firecrackers when it wasn&#39;t Diwali? Most of Chachi&#39;s romantic &#39;cross-connections&#39; -- Vs Amrish, Paresh and then Johny Walker, seem redundant to the main storyline. Tabu&#39;s bathing scene was unnecessary. The family is North Indian but must be reminded of Karva Chauth night by a &#39;Maharashtrian&#39; Chachi. Yeah, right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fine acting skills of not one but four actors namely Tabu, Om Puri, the late Amrish Puri and Paresh Rawal have been wasted in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the original Mrs Doubtfire -- clean, crisp and crackling with fun, quite unlike Chachi 420.

Man am I stoked I can leave feedback for this 10 minutes romp. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After not seeing it in years, I happened upon it the other day and watched it over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Stop shaking your eyes&#39; and &#39;shake a rock and roll band&#39; and &#39;stop sawing the table&#39; are freaking classic lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The art is delightfully raw. The dialog sparse and wonderful. Just find it and love it. Cannot recommend this enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you high school art teacher Mrs. Kogan for showing us this over and over. Thank you NFB for letting it be made. Thank you MTS for showing it (for free at the moment at least).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want a Big Snit t-shirt now. I&#39;d love an animation cell, but at 440.00 a pop, that won&#39;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find this flick, and watch it.

Two years ago at Sundance I loved Josh Kornbluth&#39;s directing debut-Haiku Tunnel. So I was looking forward to his brother (and frequent collaborator) Jacob&#39;s, The Best Thief in the World. This is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lower-class area of New York. The movie is not without its poignant moments. But at times it is as if Kornbluth is working way too hard to state the obvious: Life can be very difficult for some people. And life isn&#39;t fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More subtle, and more important, is our understanding that despite all of these somewhat abhorrent cultural underpinnings and the anti-social behavior they may spawn, these characters have no shortage of goodness and humanity. We can recoil at their language and their living conditions, but we are cannot discount their intent. And in fact, their struggles to maintain a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood, and his compassion for the people is evident throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all this, The Best Thief in the World suffers from many painful flaws (including the title). The characters aren&#39;t very believable. The writing is uneven. And the plot-line is barely discernible. And for many the most disturbing is that Kornbluth uses two young black boys mimicking gangsta rap between scenes. To each his own: But while I don&#39;t question the potential realism of this phenomenon, it pains me to see 5-year-old children mf&#39;ing and talking about having sex with a line-up of women. It&#39;s unnecessary shock value and is a forced bit of borrowed interest.

Never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent. Let&#39;s see: FIRST, they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread. NEXT, they encourage as many fundamentalist Christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget. And FINALLY, when the film hits the theaters, get as many said Christians as possible to see it yet again, bus them into the multiplexes if necessary, NOT on the merits of the film itself, but because a #1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But THAT, of course, won&#39;t be enough. I imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give &#34;Left Behind&#34; anything short of a glowing review will be deemed &#34;anti-Christian.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldn&#39;t surprise anyone. It is, after all, good old fashioned Capitalism at work. What DOES surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole &#34;Left Behind&#34; mindset. As someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality, it leaves me scratching my head. It would appear that there are many, MANY people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a &#34;Rapture&#34; is going to occur, and that millions of people all over the Earth are going to simultaneously vanish INTO THIN AIR. What kind of reality, I wonder, are these people living in? Is this &#34;Rapture&#34; something they actually believe in, or is it something they fervently WANT to believe in? And when they reach the end of their lives and realize this &#34;Rapture&#34; has not occurred, will they be disappointed and disillusioned? Will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the &#34;Rapture&#34; is imminent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a way, I almost wish that such an event would occur! What an interesting day that would be! What would be even more interesting is if the Apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion, not in the anthropological sense the authors of the &#34;Left Behind&#34; series have portrayed, but as more of a Stephen Spielberg production, with boiling clouds, trumpets, angels descending out of the sky, Moon turned to blood, the whole nine yards. Imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true, just as the evangelists had been warning for years, and that there was something more awesome than just the cold, hard, physical reality we inhabit. Wouldn&#39;t THAT be something???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet in the final analysis, it&#39;s that cold, hard, physical reality that I will content myself with. My life is not so meaningless that I need the fear of a &#34;Rapture&#34; and the &#34;End Times&#34; to make sense of it all ... nor do I need Heaven or Hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently, thank you very much.

MAJOR SPOILERS!! THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commenters have touched on the major theme of &#34;honor&#34; in the film, and too many comparisons to &#34;Braveheart.&#34; I&#39;ll point out a few things about this movie that I have not seen other comments touch on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie has a decidedly different take on abortion. The first character to get pregnant is the villain&#39;s (Roth) girlfriend, and when he coldly suggests an abortion, she states it is too late for that. The shame of her situation (&#34;I&#39;m to have a bastard&#39;s bastard.&#34;) leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene. The second character to find herself pregnant is Mary, Rob&#39;s wife, after a rape by Roth&#39;s character (and at least one sex scene with her husband, Rob). Late in the movie, as Rob is leaving for a final confrontation with Roth, Mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins, with a tone hinting of abortion. Rob replies in a noble tone, &#34;it&#39;s not the fault of the child,&#34; and then states what he thinks the name should be, girl or boy. I find this &#34;pro-life&#34; stance on the part of the hero to be very un-Hollywood. Rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment -- not coincidental symbolism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another related theme is Roth&#39;s character is a bastard, someone who evidently does not know who his father was, and has few kind words for his mother, though he wears a picture of her in a case hung from his neck. Is it coincidence that Roth (devoid of family stability) is the walking definition of psychopath, while Rob is the strong husband/father figure, and of course the hero. In the final sword fight between Rob and the villain (Roth), the former slices the latter deeply across the chest -- the left side of the chest, over the heart. His employer and pseudo-father figure (John Hurt character) holds the mother&#39;s picture in his hand and gazes at it, before snatching it from the neck of the dead Roth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also what I find interesting was the direction of the rape scene, which was not quite graphic but neither was it off-camera and implied. I found it surprising in it&#39;s somewhat matter of fact depiction, with Mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal, and subsequent post traumatic stress (as we call it now). My point being that the rape was neither sensationalized nor just implied, which I find an interesting middle road for Hollywood to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the final fight scene, I have to correct an earlier commenter: The weapon Roth chose was a rapier (or perhaps a short sword), the weapon Rob chose was a Claymore. Someone was really doing their homework on this entire scene. Roth would have the upper hand in such a situation, but of course the Claymore is a distinctly Scottish weapon. What is even more striking to me (as a fencer and someone who has read a bit on the subject) is that this final sword fight is one of the most convincing of any film ever made: The actors seem actually trying to kill each other -- not the usual slashes to the opponents blade we see in most movie fights (including the movies opening fight). Even more true to history, Roth is seen several times using the rapier as a thrusting weapon, which is it&#39;s purpose by design! (Rapiers were edged, but primarily a thrusting weapon with the edges used mainly for parrying an opponents thrust.) Rob uses the Claymore in broad slashes, as it&#39;s design intent. The fight goes down as I would expect it to -- Roth effectively wins. Though Rob wins the day by grabbing Roth&#39;s weapon (more symbolism) and striking him dead with a powerful slashing cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks, it is RARE to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll also note that for whatever reason, I remember 1995 (the year of release) distinctly as a time of distrust of the U.S. government. Hollywood was obviously tuned into that, with the release of both &#34;Rob Roy&#34; and &#34;Braveheart,&#34; and I think the anti-government leanings are why both films get so much comparison. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the different perspective that this film gives is refreshing to avid movie fans, tired of the same old, not so hidden messages from Hollywood.

I didn&#39;t know the real events when I sat down to watch this, just the fact that this was based upon a true story. After the death of the kid&#39;s father, Rhonda tries to help her daughter Desiree(... I did not know anyone actually named their offspring that) cope with the loss. This is really made for children, as is often the case with &#34;family&#34; flicks(with that said, go ahead and get everyone together for a viewing, though I&#39;d keep teenagers out of it, unless you&#39;re sure they&#39;re gonna buy the concept), but it doesn&#39;t downplay the sting that the death of a parent is, and it doesn&#39;t really talk down to anyone. The plot is sufficiently interesting, and moves along well enough. Acting varies, with the excellent Burstyn outshining most of her fellow cast, Mathis following that pretty well, and Ferland and her peers(with a few exceptions) being the least convincing of the bunch(and frankly, they&#39;re irritating; then again, I&#39;m not really in the intended audience for this thing). The editing and cinematography are standard, and certainly not less than that. While humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines or so, the tone is not an unpleasant one. There is an intense scene or two in this. I recommend this to fans of these types of movies. 7/10

Well, to each his own, but I thought Gibson&#39;s Hamlet was the most god-awful rendition I had ever witnessed... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag, and as inspired as a telemarketing call. The only reason I watched the movie through to the end was that I held out hope that either it would get better or become unintentionally funny. No luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No disrespect for the supporting cast or for Zefferelli&#39;s staging, but nothing can make up for the bungling of the main character. I have seen Hamlet well-portrayed as an African prince, as an animated lion, as a rough-and-tumble warrior, as a romantic poet, etc. etc. etc. . But IMHO this portrayal was just a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams.

It&#39;s difficult to criticize a movie with the title like &#39;Deathbed: The Bed that Eats&#39; and involves a ghost narrator who&#39;s trapped behind a 2-way painting he drew and a bed that snores and  if I&#39;m not mistaken, masturbates. (Now, that&#39;s getting back at its human companions!) Furthermore, it foams up (in orange, for whatever reason) to absorb edibles lying on its surface, including apples, wine, fried chicken and, of course, people. Again it&#39;s suffice to say, that don&#39;t expect too much when you see what I guess is stomach acid  the final remains of anything that orange suds takes  dissolving only certain things. It&#39;ll drink the wine, but the bottle&#39;s okay and it&#39;ll eat away at the chicken bone, but the bucket&#39;s just fine. Heck, the bed even replaces the unused containers. Hilariously, at one point it downs Pepto-Bismol. I had to laugh at that one. I don&#39;t think they really wanted you to take any of this seriously. It&#39;s low budget, and it&#39;s extremely easy to see where they cut costs and saved oodles amounts of money. I thought, in a world where there can be a killer &#39;Lift&#39; and a &#39;Blood Beach,&#39; this &#39;Deathbed&#39; might be amusing to watch. For reasons that might involve cost, 90% of the film is voice-over, no one screams or shows extremely low signs of fright/confusion on why a bed would attack (I can think of one  and I never was one of those kids that jumped on the bed) and you&#39;ll have to suspend your disbelief beyond belief. (A victim loses all flesh on his hands, barely saying &#34;ow.&#34;) Only one scene, that went on too long, was minutely tense  a woman attempts to crawl away only to be dragged back, using a sheet. Where are the MST3k guys?

What a waste of time! I&#39;ve tried to sit through &#39;Sky Captain..&#34; about 6 times, and every time, within about 3 minutes, I start doing something else - anything else! It&#39;s a downright boring movie, the acting is terrible, the writing dull, and obviously a first-time director, because it&#39;s stiff. And I wanted to love it. I love sci-fi, the old cliffhangers, and I can appreciate the attempt at nods to Flash Gordon, and Metropolis, but my God, what a waste of money. I used to work for Paramount Pictures, and I had written Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests. She told me they&#39;d never have an interest or need to do it. 10 years later, Paramount releases this piece of crap. Sherry was right in 1993, but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog. Blue screen an effect shot, but not an entire movie. Let&#39;s not forget, neither Jude nor Jolie are terrific actors (but easy on the eyes). Paltrow&#39;s performance reminds me of a high school effort. Too bad - it could&#39;ve worked, but only under a skilled director. the funny thing is, Sky Captain&#39;s director will keep getting work, even after this dreck. It&#39;s commerce, not art!

You like to solve mysteries? You like complex narrations? This is for you. Brilliant, clever movie by Francis Leclerc(son of a legendary french Canadian signer Felix Leclerc). Flashy photo and clever editing is the word of Leclerc, strongly helped by Roy Dupuis who&#39;s dythirambic in the lead role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, veterinary in his 40&#39;s who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer&#39;s sufferings on the road. Throughout the struggling, he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not spooky, but very mysterious and well played movie. I have my hypothesis on the ending(I think the Indian caused the accident) but this ending was open to any explanations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend it 9.5/10

This 1939 film from director John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells a fictional tale of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his trials (literally) and his tribulations. It&#39;s a sentimental film, reasonably well made but hardly breathtaking. The casting of Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems a mistake, for while the actor had the right doleful qualities for the part, even with several inches of makeup and a false nose he&#39;s way too handsome for Honest Abe, who was famously homely. It&#39;s a good try from Fonda, who&#39;s nothing if not sincere, but his miscasting throws the entire film off. The supporting cast is excellent, though, and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too reverential in his treatment of Lincoln, who is presented as just shy of a saint, and in the final scene the movie goes way over the top.

I guess I should now comment upon a 4th flick in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise; the sequels still surprise or amaze meby their sleaze and deliberate _absurdism. They constitute or forge a 4th waynot classic, not revisionist, not Europeanbut a sleaze Americana, kindred to the violent vigilante &#39;70s movies, absurd trash. This installment too is bombastic sleazeinexplicably awkward and even somewhat strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now what I find disturbing that these sequels not only have their opportunist fans; but that the fans simply do not sense any difference between the original&#39;s style and the sequels&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sequels are not boring or insipidbut bizarre. They are of course very badly writtenmessy scripts, rubbish lines. It&#39;s straight crazy; in this installment each gunman gets several women Van Cleef&#39;s young wife begs him to release a young prisoner; he finally does. The young man resumes his life, shoots Van Cleef, kidnaps the wife, rapes and kills herthen joins a wrongdoer. Van Cleef, who has previously refused to help defending a village, now assembles a small bunch and charges the wrongdoer&#39;s hacienda; then the wrongdoers charge the village where Van Cleef has set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van Cleef is Chris; Stefanie Powers, pretty active in the &#39;70s screwy westerns, is Van Cleef&#39;s darling. Callan, very antipathetic, is Noah, a writer and Chris&#39; sidekick. The rest of the aggressive bunch are Askew (one of the only three survivors), Armendariz, Lucking, Lauter; Rita Rogers is truly hot, fleshy beauty.

Terrible...just terrible. Probably the worst film I have ever seen. And I did see some pretty bad pictures, throughout the years. The sound sucks so does the quality of the picture, the direction, the acting...etc, etc. The only good shoots( meaning funny, because they&#39;re so bad ) are the special effects. Overall there are about 5 minutes worth of laughs. The rest of the flick gives you brain damage.

Cobb. It sucked. I learned nothing about the man I had not heard before. The performances were over the top. A scene where Cobb and Al are driving down a snowy road in search of women in Reno has to be one of the worst conceived scenes in recent memory. It&#39;s just plain STUPID and unentertaining. The flashback sequences were terrible. And they used the same sequences OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. If I saw the same shot of Cobb fighting with someone at a base one more time, I would have become physically ill. By watching this &#39;movie&#39;, we get to learn NOTHING of what it was like in Cobb&#39;s era. We learn nothing about his relationship with his players, nothing about his days as a manager, nothing about his relationship with his family members, other than that `they don&#39;t like him&#39;. I thought when I sat down to view this film I would learn SOMETHING about the era of baseball in which Cobb played. Instead, all I got to see was a retread of how Cobb hated everything and everyone, and how they hated him. Boy, what a great movie (sarcasm intended). Cobb is portrayed as a constant liar in the film, so which one of his stories is supposed to be accurate? Who knows? Who cares? No one will after viewing this piece of crap. If you decide to rent this film, make sure the fast forward button on your VCR is working, as you will be tempted to use it repeatedly. Hopefully someday someone will make a GOOD film about Ty Cobb. I liked this film about as much as the people in it liked Cobb, which is to say - I HATED IT. Now I know why I found it in the RENT ONE GET ONE FREE section of the video store. I think I will ask for my fifty cents back from the video clerk, since I can&#39;t get back the time I wasted watching this trash. Oh well, what could I have possibly been thinking about a movie that would feature Robert Wuhl.

I wasn&#39;t terribly impressed with Dante&#39;s 1st season offering in &#34;Homecoming&#34;, it wasn&#39;t much of a horror story, but rather a smart political statement with the undead. Screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men&#39;s sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women. The episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists. Then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home. I assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak, but is unclear because this is never revisited. The episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah.It seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end. The worst episode. Well, except for chocolate.

(As a note, I&#39;d like to say that I saw this movie at my annual church camp, where the entire youth group laughed at it. I bought it when I saw it on a shelf one year later, if only for the humor I derived from a bad attempt at making an evangelical movie.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lay it Down falls short of many movie fans&#39; expectations on several different planes. Most of the problems lie within the impersonal acting. Regardless of the nice cars in the film, or the truth in Christ&#39;s sacrifice for you, as a movie AND witnessing tool, Lay it Down hardly delivers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most good opinions of the movies are supported by Christians agreeing with the message. While it&#39;s easy for a Christian to agree with the points delivered, the audience hardly ever witnesses life outside a cliché. The fighting scene between Ben and his brother is horribly dubbed. And there are at least three blatant typos in the subtitles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I encourage anyone to watch the movie a second time with the director&#39;s commentary on. It really helps you understand just why the movie was written how it was. The director&#39;s views on secular society are practically opposite of what would cater to a movie-goer&#39;s needs: he shows a pedantic understanding of Nonchristians, as well as some points of religious conflict; most of the editing, he admits, was rushed, but &#34;satisfactory&#34;; he thought the over-used transitions and themes to be effective; and was completely happy with the acting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also inserted motifs that he was rather proud of: -All (read: most) of the names are significant. Ben Destin = &#34;Been Destined&#34;, Gus Pelman = &#34;Gospel Man&#34;, Nicky D = Nicodemus. -The car doing donuts is symbolic of the circling nothingness that is a life without Christ. -When Ben leaves on Pete&#39;s motorcycle, he crosses his crutches to form a &#34;cross&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not making any of those up. He throws around things like this in between saying while street racers and the like &#34;blow their brains out with guns&#34;, and how &#34;God is in control when your born and when your die&#34;. Yes, that was not a typo. He really says that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have (little) forgiveness reserved for this movie. The &#34;cool cars&#34; and &#34;good message&#34; don&#39;t do jack to make this movie good. However, the movie was made from a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget less than 1/100th of &#34;The Fast and the Furious&#39;s&#34;, and the time limit was unforgiving. With that in mind, I give it a score of 2/10, instead of the 1/10 I so dearly think it deserves.

If it had been made 2 years later it would have been BANNED! The number one MUST SEE recommendation of the day!. The best Rouben Mamoulian film I have seen this far (have but have not yet seen J+H).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s no wonder why this film got less than 200 votes. A bigger greyzone that could not care less about what&#39;s proper would not be seen again until the 60&#39;s. As morally ambiguous and dark as 70&#39;s grit but with a certain charm as well. Of course this had to lay low in the later 30&#39;s and sadly it does not appear to have been re-discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. This got it all. Great actors: Gary Cooper, Sylvia Sidney and the this time not so lovable Guy Kibbee. And a mighty good director. This far I haven&#39;t been RM&#39;s biggest fans but I have liked his films a lot and with this he steps into a new league. One of the best 30&#39;s films I have ever seen! This is something I never thought even existed! 9.5/10

BASEketball is indeed a really funny movie. David Zucker manages to make us all laugh our heads off again, in a really silly, but many times smart, comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 creators of South Park, the main actors in this film, play very good, surprisingly good actually, but this is the first time i see them as actors. The movie oftenly reminded me of South Park - one of my fav shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a really good and funny film, so don&#39;t miss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vote: 7.5 out of 10.

What can you expect from a direct to DVD film? You know what you are getting yourself into when you rent this. The quality of the cinematography reminds me of reality TV shows. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are they shots always up so close to the actors!? And why are they always centered? There isn&#39;t anything to look at. (And the actors are that great looking, so that blows.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing and dialogue is just plain awful. That intro scene, with the British Guy is hilarious. Just try and listen this words, they hardly make any sense, just goes around in circles. The lines in the rest of the movie sounds like they were pull out of romance and sci-fi novels, as if the writers had no idea what they were doing. The characters definitely sound like they have no idea what they&#39;re saying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a terrible movie. I feel bad for the actors tied to this project. Embarrassing!

&#34;A death at a college campus appears to be a suicide but is actually a cover for murder. The dead man&#39;s roommate finds himself embroiled in a mystery as he tries to uncover the truth behind the young man&#39;s murder. Twists and turns, as well as some false leads, makes this a tough case for our collegiate hero to solve, let alone (keep) out of the clutches of the killer,&#34; according to the DVD sleeve&#39;s synopsis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stars may be bigger than the movie. Handsome Charles Starrett (as Ken Harris), who has a small &#34;lingerie&#34; scene, became one of the top western stars of the forties, peaking in &#34;The Return of the Durango Kid&#34; (1945). The man playing his father, Robert Warwick (as Joseph Harris), was one of the most respected actors of the teens, beginning with his performance in &#34;Alias Jimmy Valentine&#34; (1915). Watch out for red herrings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** A Shot in the Dark (2/1/35) Charles Lamont ~ Charles Starrett, Robert Warwick, James Bush

I was so disturbed by the real footage at the beginning of the film that I felt sick to my stomach and ended up shutting the movie off. How any can give this film more than a rating of 1 baffles me. I know that the intent of the movie is to shock, but showing actual footage of a dog that had been skinned alive (holding back vomit as I type) - PLEASE! I shut it off after the scene with the decomposing baby. I had had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point. No wonder this movie was found at the bargain bin in HMV. I really have no desire to see any other movie by this Uwe person. Anyone who enjoyed this needs therapy. Period.

It Came from Outer Space II is a very good film that has a good cast which includes Brian Kerwin, Elizabeth Peña, Jonathan Carrasco, Adrian Sparks, Bill McKinney, Dean Norris, Dawn Zeek, Lauren Tewes, Mickey Jones, Iilana B&#39;tiste, Jerry Giles, and Howard Morris! The acting by all of these actors is very good. Kerwin and Norris are really excellent in this film. I thought that they performed good. The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising. The movie is filmed very good. The music is great by Shirley Walker. The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. This is a very good and thrilling film. If you like Brian Kerwin, Elizabeth Peña, Jonathan Carrasco, Adrian Sparks, Bill McKinney, Dean Norris, Dawn Zeek, Lauren Tewes, Mickey Jones, the rest of the cast in the film, Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thrillers, Dramas, and interesting Action films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Nuttball&#39;s NOTE: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed this is the second film that Dean Norris and Mickey Jones were in a movie together. The other being the classic violent epic Total Recall! Funny seeing them in another alien flick! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like alien movies and/or the subject of aliens I also recommend the following films: The Thing from another World, The Day the Earth Stood Still, War of the Worlds (1953 &amp; 2005), Horror Express, The UFO Incident, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, John Carpenter&#39;s The Thing, Krull, The Return of the Aliens: The Deadly Spawn, Time Walker, My Science Project, Howard the Duck, John, Carpenter&#39;s Starman, John Carpenter&#39;s They Live, Mac and Me, Explorers, Invaders from Mars, Alien Seed, The Abyss, Communion, Suburban Commando, Fire in the Sky, The Arrival, Mars Attacks! Contact, Men in Black I &amp; 2, Stephen King&#39;s Dreamcatcher, Xtro 3: Watch the Skies, Battlefield Earth: A Saga for the year 3000, Stargate, The Puppet Masters, John Carpenter&#39;s Village of the Damned, Independence Day, Life Form, Contact, The X-Files: Fight the Future, Roswell: The Aliens Attack, The Faculty, Mission to Mars, Pitch Black, Evolution, K-Pax, Signs, Silent Warnings, The Forgotten, Alien Hunter, Spaceballs, Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Predator &amp; Predator 2, AVP: Alien Vs.

I very nearly walked out, but I&#39;d paid my money, and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out. After the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of &#34;A New Hope&#34; and the thrilling sophistication of &#34;The Empire Strikes Back,&#34; I remember awaiting &#34;Return of the Jedi&#34; with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn&#39;t have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba&#39;s lair, this &#34;film&#34; was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable, profit-making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards, the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky, that vile muppet-pet of Jabba&#39;s, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas didn&#39;t even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from &#34;A New Hope&#34; and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can&#39;t shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: &#34;I&#39;ve got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they&#39;ll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in, and I get a cut from every single one. It&#39;ll make me even more obscenely rich.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may have been a paltry, partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total, absolute sell-out to profit.

All of the trials and tribulations of making a no budget movie right from the mouths of those involved. You feel all of the sweat, guts, determination and dedication Stuie put into this labor of love and the frustration of being left hanging after all his work. The clips of interviews with all involved provides a great flowing narrative and conveys the balls-out, hardcore punk, almost anarchic attitude it took to film &#34;Waldo&#34; and subsequently the documentary. Stuie and company deserve all the props in the world for not giving up when the going got tough and getting &#34;A Texas Tale of Treason&#34; out so we can see what it&#39;s like for the budding filmmaker on the street!

The Gymnast (2006) was written and directed by Ned Farr. Dreya Weber portrays Jane Hawkins, a former world-class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified massage therapist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges around Jane&#39;s accidental reunion with a former teammate. Although this meeting takes place, that plot line is secondary to the main plot, which involves Jane, her husband, and a professional dancer named Serena (Addie Yungmee). The two women develop an act of the type performed by Cirque de Soleil. The two complement each other--Jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body strength. Serena is more elegant and artistic, although, obviously, also capable of incredible physical feats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film works because we can understand how Jane would turn to Addie, who is caring and compassionate, while Jane&#39;s husband has taken her for granted for the many years of their marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and Dreya has the lean body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. They clearly are truly performing their act, and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would indeed, be a success in Las Vegas, or anywhere else they traveled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sexual tension between the women is obvious, and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air. A woman with a neglectful husband and an attractive woman partner make for an explosive situation, which isn&#39;t resolved in a neat and tidy fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the six films we saw at the Rochester NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival, we thought this one was the best. It will work on DVD, and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen. NOTE: Stay for the credits!

I enjoyed this film. It was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of Peter O&#39;Donnell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of people have disliked the film, but it has to be seen in context of the origin story that it is. The film uses flashback to show the young Modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman that she became. Before the Network. Before Willie Garvin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pace is a trifle slow, and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes. However this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Modesty Blaise, you will enjoy it even with its faults, if you just want an action flick with car chases - forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the feeling of being the first of a franchise, but as I have never seen it promoted anywhere, I suspect there will be no more to follow. Sadly.

The interplay between the characters is a moral disaster. You end up disliking most of the characters and you don&#39;t particularly like any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the two main characters played by David and Gwen are so badly written that you really don&#39;t care one bit about them. The movie has no plot, no direction and no purpose. The single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers - and that&#39;s hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste.

I loved this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hiding, along with her young son, from a mysterious past. As an anglophile who loves romances... this movie was just my cup of tea and I would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours into the England of the 1800&#39;s. I also must mention that Toby Stephens who portrays the very magnetic Gilbert Markham is reason enough to watch this wonderful production.

Direction must be the problem here. I recently heard John Cleese speaking of working a skit for Fawlty Towers. He was supposed to attack his car with a branch. The first branch was too flimsy and not funny. The second branch was too stiff to be funny. The third was just flimsy enough to be funny. This sort of attention to detail is missing from &#34;Corky Romano&#34;. No matter how embarrassingly unfunny a comic bit was, it wasn&#39;t fixed, and wasn&#39;t left on the cutting room floor. The one value I can find in this movie is as a study of a very flawed movie which somehow escaped into distribution without being repaired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve scanned dozens of other reviews here. The number of reviews praising this absolute waste of time bolsters my suspicion that some people are getting paid to promote titles. I can&#39;t fathom how anyone over the age of 9 could rate this title more than a 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 is average. I can&#39;t imagine anyone, even those making money off of this, rating it even as much as average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time. And, hey, I actually LIKE the Three Stooges and can even tolerate Ed Wood!

I originally saw this movie in a movie theater on Times Square in the late eighties. Who would have thought this film would spawn two sequels and have this cult following.Night of the Demons was like most other films that came out at the time.A group of horny teenagers find themselves trapped in some isolated local and then are killed off one at a time in various gruesome ways.Come to think of it the formula still is used and still seems to work as evidenced by Saw II that I recently saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw Mimi Kinkade at a Fangoria convention about six years ago and she was so gentle hearted!I guess that makes her a pretty good actress if she could make a career out of playing this demon possessed woman in all these horror flicks.Anyway, I just this film again on VHS cassette and this movie still holds up.A little slow at the beginning as I remembered when I first saw it but then it quickly picks up pace. One of the eighties horror classics and worth a look!

First, I am a big fan of Alien and Alien II - in my opinion both of these movies created and defined the Si-Fi Horror Genre as we know it today. I noticed Lifeforce was often compared to the Aliens saga - after viewing this movie I would highly disagree. There are some okay special effects with the alien vampires, and the story line might have been acceptable. I just can&#39;t get past a naked woman space vampire throughout the whole movie, this is absolutely absurd (although she does look good). Add in a bunch of bad British acting and it&#39;s pretty much OVER. Most of the movie ends up taking place in London or somewhere in England, so after the first 20 minutes you lose the outerspace setting and any hope of some real Si-Fi Horror action and suspense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles despite mom&#39;s flighty behavior. Apart from several good sequences, I didn&#39;t quite buy Susan Sarandon as a flake (she&#39;s too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devil-may-care lady), and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent. Natalie Portman fares much better as her kid, and yet there&#39;s a creepy aloofness to her work (and some of her scenes, such as the one where she asks a boy to strip, are misguided and uncomfortable to watch). Certainly not an incompetent piece, &#34;Anywhere But Here&#34; does have moments that work, but it isn&#39;t an embraceable film, nor has it proved to be an important one. ** from ****

First off, anyone looking for meaningful &#34;outcome oriented&#34; cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated, emotive, heartfelt thespians, please leave now. You are wasting your time and life is short, go see the new Brangelina Jolie movie, have a good cry, go out &amp; buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better, and leave us alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t let the door hit you on the way out either. THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN is a grade B minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of Oklahoma by a young, TV friendly cast &amp; crew, and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects, wakes up in a hospital, and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump. The melting man is played by one Alex Rebar, who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film. But once he starts oozin&#39; with Rick Baker&#39;s extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny, viscous blebs of grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points: There are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care, really. It&#39;s a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it -- One great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out. Hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;hero&#34; of the film is played by Burr DeBenning, a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s &amp; 80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the Kevin Spacey prototype; slightly twisted, neurotic, and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused. He appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for TV anthology horror piece called HOUSE OF THE DEAD (or THE ALIEN ZONE) that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in Oklahoma, which is where I suspect this film was made as well. The arid, cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same, and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that Cameron Mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in WITHOUT WARNING ... which also had a sick sense of humor, a TV friendly cast, and some pretty outrageous gore. I definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies, as well as THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS which is of no surprise considering that director Jonathan Demme is a part of MELTING MAN&#39;s cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, as others have pointed out, this is a 1950s B movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects &amp; the inevitable boobs. The movie it probably borrows most of it&#39;s ideas from is PHANTOM FROM SPACE with Peter Graves as an astronaut who also returns to Earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree. One of the things that I actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting man&#39;s motivations: He simply goes on a rampage and the movie&#39;s drama comes from wondering if he&#39;s going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness. The budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen, Rick Baker&#39;s disgusting effects getting the lion&#39;s share of whatever was spent on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sick, disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer. Why can&#39;t people have made more movies like these? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10

This isn&#39;t a movie. It is a collection of unrelated, ill-conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim 10 year old with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor - the one with the greasy hair, dead-pan stare, ipod and nervous tic - probably shot it herself in a creative phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you made it further than the ten minutes I did, don&#39;t bother trying to fit what you saw into the context of the European Artiste mentality praised above. This is a true and complete waste of time, money and film that would have made William One-Shot Beaudine cringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum-packed characters is representative of what now passes for much of humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s next? Six directors shooting social intercourse at the Wal-Mart snack counter?

A virtual carbon copy of The Cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot. I knew the movie was going downhill when I saw the fake campfire flikering lights clearly reflected in a facial close up of one of the actors. The conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever, and added nothing to the film except fewer moments of silence. The acting wasn&#39;t as bad as the typical B movie, and there was some believability in their fear, but as professional cavers, they seem to be too psychologically unstable for their chosen profession. Overall not worth wasting $4.50 to rent.

I really enjoyed the detail that went into the script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Rhys Myers (misspelled) and Jewel were outstanding in their support roles. As was Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire gave as fine a acting job as ever depicted, when he had to amputate his best friend&#39;s arm, knowing he would die without the procedure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attention to detail, with good dialect coaching to catch the Southern accent incredibly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why this movie was swept under the rug by the Hollywood promoters I can only imagine. I have strong suspicions. Which makes it all the more appealing to me. I have given a dozen DVD copies out for presents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely overlooked movie. Rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours, then judge.

This has the absolute worst performance from Robert Duval who sounds just like William Buckley throughout the entire film. His hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest. I&#39;m not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or inadvertent but it&#39;s the only thing I can recall from a truly forgettable film. This picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do. Thank God, Duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent. He is a good character actor but that&#39;s about it. Klaus is so much better. His performance is muted and noteworthy.

OVERALL PERFORMANCE :- At last the long waiting AAG hits the screens. Unfortunately, it couldn&#39;t set progressive fire in the audience. The first best thing to talk about the movie is The idea of remaking the mighty SHOLAY. And Varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie. If he repeated the same Ramghad backdrop, people will again say there is nothing new in this. Different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy. Right from the start of his career with SIVA in Telugu, he had been using the same lighting and kind of background. I seriously dunno this guy Varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis GODFATHER. It&#39;s all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Why would some body use so many Dutch angles and extreme closeup shots!!!!!!! The shot division is lame. Characters couldn&#39;t carry an emotion, performances are not to their mark, Storytelling is worse, Background is really really terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Babban:- Amitabhz been over prioritized to his job. VARMA produced great villains like Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of Hindi Cinema. There&#39;s no comparison of Gabbar with Babban. Babban is a more psycho rather than a villain, still he has a soft corner for his brother ( It&#39;s a gift in this movie). Amitabhz performance is not to his mark. His appearance itself is pathetic. The scar on his nose, symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema. What ever they worked on Babban is not successful. Babban is no comparison with Gabbar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narsimha:- The first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands. If varma did that , it would be like teaching ABCD to a Bachelor degree holder. Itz good he opened the secret early. But the flashback is pathetic. Varma couldn&#39;t use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durga:- The only character with betterment. This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo:- No body bothers or at least considers these character. The utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz. These characters carry nothing to this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RAMGOPALVARMA:- His quality is degrading, diminishing. AAG totally can be treated as a C grade movie. Sholay is a fire of revenge, problem of a town, meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by Dharmendra. AAG never carried an emotion with its characters. Storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters. Don&#39;t compare AAG with sholay, still u will not like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you dare watch this movie. You will be burnt alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG

This movie has Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer all together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the Indians and you can hardly recognize him. This was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time. This movie starts out with Lincoln&#39;s assassination and it also deals with an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home. This movie also deals with Custer&#39;s last stand and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and i usually don&#39;t like Jean Arthur but i liked her here.

Titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. It has its problems (what movies don&#39;t) but still, it&#39;s enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is &#34;wait a minute, you don&#39;t?&#34; I know so many people who don&#39;t like this movie, and I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t see why. &#34;The love story is too cheesy&#34; well, yes but isn&#39;t it enjoyable and moving? All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn&#39;t actually exist. But this is a movie, doesn&#39;t everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. However I think it&#39;s unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, if one is going to complain that they don&#39;t like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I&#39;m sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. It&#39;s like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well deserving of its Oscars, in particular, Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I&#39;ve ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each other&#39;s names throughout the movie. The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it&#39;s an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this movie 10/10, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it&#39;s an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.

Now I did watch this when it first came out on VHS, and all my friends and I thought it was a pretty good movie, but then again, we were teenagers. But honestly, not that good of a movie in retrospect. Sort of a hair metal, Dokken version of Carnival of Souls. But a bad movie does not exactly mean it is unwatchable; however, this one seems to lack the charm a lot of the regular Mst3k fodder usually contains. But if it was on cable, and I was bored and drinking beer--sure, I&#39;d watch it again. But then again, I&#39;ve watched Howling VII about five times now, so maybe you really shouldn&#39;t be listening to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone else think it kind of sad that the director supposedly commented on his own movie? And why did he feel the urge to use caps lock so much?

jeez, this was immensely boring. the leading man (Christian Schoyen) has got to be the worst actor i have ever seen. and another thing, if the character in the movie moved to America when he was ten or something and had been living here for over 20 years, he would speak a lot better English than what he pulls of here. or to say it in my own Language &#34;Skikkelig gebrokkent&#34;. But it is cool to see Norwegian dudes in a movie made in Hollywood. it was just a damn shame they were talentless hacks. The storyline itself is below mediocre. I have a suspicion that Christian Schoyen did this movie just to live the dream, as he clearly does in the film by humping one beautiful babe after another.

My friends and I have watched this so many time I have lost count. This is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind, meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects. This film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;ll laugh as Greg leaps and shuffles around the lab, petting his pet rabbit, while his hunchback shifts from right to left on his back. &#34;Greg, stop clowning!&#34;, scolds Dr. Brandon. You&#39;ll laugh as J.G. Patterson gives hand signals to direct Greg to the other side of the operating table, while his hand is in the shot. And you&#39;ll probably chuckle when you realize that the final woman has none of the features he used to construct her with.

This movie was well done. It covers the difficulties a returning Vietnam veteran has in dealing with the horrors of war. Unfortunately the writers chose to focus on a Vet who had been involved in an act of atrocity. I was in Vietnam and only once heard of such an act by one who witnessed it. The offender was prosecuted and sentenced to many years in Leavenworth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The notion that only vets involved in atrocities had emotional problems is a disservice to all who served. All of the soldiers I knew personally or knew of by word of mouth were honorable soldiers who respected even the enemy and believed they were there to halt the spread of Communism. The biggest problem was coming home to learn that many Americans were opposed to the war. That is what caused many Veterans to feel they had taken part in something less than honorable. Not the manner in which they served.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending depicted the father acting more as a belligerent bully than a loving, caring father. For that I gave it a 7 out of 10. Had the ending allowed for a degree of acceptance I could have rated it a 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most decent men will come home from war with guilt and emotional scars. They need acceptance and understanding to overcome that. I pray that the public is more understanding of our present day Veterans than it was in the the Vietnam era.

&#39;One-Round&#39; Jack Sander is called that because he&#39;s a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience. If they can last one round, they win a prize--a popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago. Jack is in love with the ticket girl, Mabel, though her head is quickly turned when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his chances with Jack. What no one at the fight knows is that Bob is the champ, so he&#39;s able to beat Jack--though it takes him some work. As a result, Bob asks Jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit. Later, Jack improves so much that he, too, becomes a legitimate boxer. Slowly, he works his way up the rankings until he&#39;s nearly ready to take on the Champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, the Champ and Mabel start running around behind Jack&#39;s back--even though by now Mabel has married Jack. So, when the final fight occurs between Jack and Bob, it&#39;s very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will rise justifiable rage against Bob help or hinder his performance? Tune in and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery-suspense films, back in the 1920s, Hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote (he did both for this film). In fact, in many ways this film is more indicative of Hitchcock&#39;s silent style, as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents, THE MANXMAN (also starring Carl Brisson as the wronged husband). So, while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day, it was not a radical departure for this great director--even with its rather formulaic ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while a bit predictable and having Ian Hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly, the film works well. While far from a perfect silent, it&#39;s well worth seeing and packs a nice punch.

This was such a waste of time. Danger: If you watch it you will be tempted to tear your DVD out of the wall and heave it thru the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An amateur production: terrible, repetitive, vacuous dialog; paper-thin plot line; wooden performances; Lucy Lawless was pathetically hackneyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously flawed story, completely unbelievable characters. The two worst concepts in film and t.v. are: (1) the evil twin, (2) amnesia. There are no twins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot &#34;twist&#34;? Outrageously simplistic and obvious - like watching a train coming down the track in the middle of the day on the prairies. It doesn&#39;t even resolve properly. The evil is not punished for the original crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, please, please - don&#39;t watch this even if its free and your only other choice is to go to a synagogue.

This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Parks and returned the world eye again to what little of the &#34;Wild Western Canada&#34; is left. When Archie began to write his stories for the papers; the thought of the day was to tame the wilderness and convert/absorb the First Nation Peoples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film puts forward and asks the question; why would a well-educated, obviously talented Englishman become an Indian?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Archie, as an English boy dreams about becoming something but grasping the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless - no mater what it is. Sounds like a famous puppet story doesn&#39;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In my opinion, I saw Archie become my living image of the &#34;Cigar store Indian&#34; a very wooden character and not real at all - very well done acting on the part of Mr. Brosnan. He also portrayed the wild Indian in the dance scene for the tourist. The fullness and or reality of it weren&#39;t realized till he met and married his wife, Annie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the Englishman&#39;s world stage, not as himself but Grey Owl -an Canadian Native of the wilderness frontier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is the closest Archie get to becoming the noble savage prototype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Mr. Brosnan&#39;s interpretation as well as the directors is both well done. I have watched documentaries on Grey Owl and I think this is a good big screen movie to add to my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoiler - I thought the final scenes with Archie going to meet the Grand Council of Chiefs was a great a great moment in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Very beautiful Canadian lake scenery and real &#34;Grey Owl&#34; locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I know, I know: it&#39;s childish. But I just love this type of movie. A bird that suffered a lot of &#34;mishaps&#34; and still hasn&#39;t lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor. What&#39;s special about this film is the fact that the main character is Paulie -the parrot- and he&#39;s not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor. Furthermore I like the storyline: Paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom. (By the way: Jay Mohr&#39;s voice almost sounds like Joe Pesci&#39;s!). And Cheech Marin of course, the man IS humor to me. Ever since I saw &#34;Up in Smoke&#34; I have appreciated his naive way of performing, making a simple situation a hilarious one.. can&#39;t help myself.

There are just so many things wrong with this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff Bridges weird accent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rita&#39;s ability to crack the password code &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire script &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending - esp the last scene when two coffees are brought to the table for Jeff and Rita and the publisher. J &amp; R laugh and say &#34;We don;t drink coffee anymore&#34;. Well, why did they order it then??? They obviously did. If they didn&#39;t and the waiter brought everyone a coffee by default there would have been three coffees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total Tosh.

TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20&#39;s during the filming of DeMille&#39;s first version of the 10 Commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille&#39;s sets are unearthed in the desert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the worst films I&#39;ve seen in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film? If this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness. If its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons.You will laugh long and hard AT this film, probably more than many other Hollywood &#34;comedies&#34;.

So this was an HBO &#34;Made for TV Movie&#34; eh? Is that an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible acting? Such a shame to see Jim Belushi reduced to a role so repetitive (shot at, survived, lies, beaten up, survives, shot at, lies and so ad infinitum. Call that a script? As for the Brits, embarrassing to see Timothy Dalton&#39;s pathetic (or was he just taking the p***, depends how much he was paid I guess?) attempt at a Southern Sheriff). As for that other Brit, the bleached blond one, what a w***er! There is a trend towards glorifying these &#34;English speaking&#34; (sic) super-violent thugs lately, perhaps thanks to Mr. Madonna&#39;s two movies succeed in entertaining and justify the violence by skillful use of irony and humour, like Pulp Fiction does. However, this movie discredits and devalues the genre. definately one to miss.

Except people apparently buy into this garbage! As shows like &#34;Moral Orel&#34; have shown, even if you tried to make the most outrageous, over-the-top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of, it wouldn&#39;t come close to the hilarity of this show. It&#39;s hard to tell what&#39;s even going on when you&#39;re watching it. Is it a news show? A talk show? Who knows!? They start out by reporting on various international news stories, but at seemingly random points, the news is interrupted by this odd, troll-like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face, mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat Robertson doesn&#39;t even seem like such a bad guy at first glance. He just seems like a senile, yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who has called for an assassination, who has befriended and offered aid to not one, but TWO murderous dictators, who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines, who has SUPPORTED forced abortions in China, and who regularly implies that Caucasians (straight American male Caucasians in particular) are superior to all other races.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this would all be funny, except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later (either that, or enough money to bribe some TV executives who don&#39;t give a damn what they show). The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people, somewhere, must be watching it and hanging onto every word. Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is, people still listen to him. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s funny or scary. I guess a healthy mixture of both.

I thought &#34;What&#39;s New Scooby-Doo&#34; was pretty bad (yes, I&#39;m sorry to say I didn&#39;t like it), since Hanna-Barbera didn&#39;t produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series. When I heard &#34;Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue&#34; was in the works, I thought it could be better. But when I saw a pic of how Scooby and Shaggy were going to appear, I knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. I watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just yet another &#34;Teen Titans&#34; or &#34;Loonatics Unleashed&#34;-wannabe. No longer are Scooby and Shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. Now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo have become more brave, too. Also, since Shaggy IS NOT going to be a vegetarian in this series, Casey Kasem (whom actually IS a vegetarian), the original voice of Shaggy, will NOT voice Shaggy. He will only voice Shaggy if he doesn&#39;t eat meat, and that was just a stupid corporate-done change to update the franchise, as if the Internet jokes weren&#39;t enough. So Scott Menville (whom previously voiced Red Herring on &#34;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&#34;) voices Shaggy here. Believe me, the voice is REALLY BAD! It makes Shaggy sound like a squeaky 10-year-old, and I must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look. However, Kasem DOES voice Shaggy&#39;s Uncle Albert, which is a sort of good thing. Scooby-Doo, on the other hand, does not look that well. He seems to have been designed to look more like the CGI Scooby-Doo from the live-action movies. Also, Scooby&#39;s Frank Welker voice (need I mention Brain the Dog again?) still hasn&#39;t improved. Robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than Scrappy-Doo! He tries to be funny and does &#34;comical&#34; impressions and gives safety tips (&#34;Remember kids, don&#39;t stand under trees during a thunderstorm!&#34;), but it just doesn&#39;t fit into a Scooby-Doo cartoon. Again, the Hanna-Barbera sound effects are rarely used here. However, on one episode, &#34;Lightning Strikes Twice,&#34; they use the &#34;Castle thunder&#34; thunderclaps during it, almost extensively! (Although they DO still use the newly-recorded thunder sound effects, too.) Scooby-Doo hasn&#39;t use &#34;Castle thunder&#34; sound effects since 1991. But my question is, why use &#34;Castle thunder&#34; on &#34;Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue,&#34; while NOT use it on the direct-to-video movies or even on &#34;What&#39;s New Scooby-Doo!&#34; (Two episodes of WNSD used it, and it wasn&#39;t enough, unfortunately.) If WNSD and the DTV movies used it, then they might be better than this crappy cartoon. The day this show premiered, I watched the first episode, and it was SO bad I turned it off after only five minutes! To get my mind off of this poor show, I rented &#34;Scooby-Doo, Pirates Ahoy!&#34; which came out around the same time. And you know what? The &#34;Pirates Ahoy&#34; movie was actually BETTER than &#34;Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue&#34; (and even better than &#34;What&#39;s New, Scooby-Doo!&#34;) And it looks like the new designs that the characters have isn&#39;t permanent to the franchise. The direct-to-video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs, thankfully. But, whether you loved or hated &#34;What&#39;s New Scooby-Doo,&#34; I don&#39;t recommend it. But if you HATE the old series, THEN you&#39;ll love it! (Oh god, I hope the old Scooby-Doo cartoon stay better than this new $#*%!) Anyways, like WNSD, a really bad addition to the Scooby canon.

I suck at gratuitous Boob references, so i&#39;m just going to write a plainly flat (no pun intended) review. I love Elvira, not in a &#34;I&#39;m-going-to-shoot-the-pres-just-to-impress-jodi-foster-fanatical&#34; way, But suffice to say I think she rocks. The movie is played like a 50&#39;s horror film only alot more fun, look for the &#34;Leasurely stroking of the ankle&#34; reference to know what I mean. what relay shines through in the movie is Elvira&#39;s (or should that be cassandras) absolute charm. i first saw this movie at the tender age of 8, and have seen it contless times since.. I realy should get around to buying a copy, the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear. If any other fans of the movie want to e-mail me about it feel free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s another great performance from Edie McClurg (chastedy pariah) an actress who never gets the attention she deserves.

I finally rented this video after searching for it for many months. Initially I only wanted to see it because I&#39;m an out and out Neil Pearson fan (Patrick, boyfriend of Isobel, the lead). However, the movie stands up very well without Neil (although he handles himself very well in this movie, he is overshadowed by the three main female characters). It&#39;s an eerie, intense movie, the sort the Brits do so well - definitely a &#34;chick flick&#34; the house and it&#39;s isolated setting giving the movie an almost &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34; aura. The movie is full of tension and the ending, shocking, yet somehow inevitable. I&#39;m glad I watched it, it was worth the wait

... and I have seen some bad ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing good to say about this movie. The acting is poor by Jennifer Tilly - as to be expected. Daryl Hannah does an OK job, but nothing close to being able to save this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is so weak - though based on a good premise - that the writer resorted to the &#34;stupid heroine trick&#34; to create a contrived suspense. When all Daryl Hannah would have to do is hide, she runs out in front of her pursuer. The hospital scene is absurd. Without exposing too much of what passes for a plot, I think it would be difficult for a bloody petite woman to carry a pregnant from a hospital without being noticed. Lame. Very lame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some time and pick out another flick.

Although Kurt Russell was and is probably the closest person to look like Elvis in show-business, so many things were false in this film. First of all, the makers claimed Elvis opened his famous live shows in &#39;69 after a 9 year hault for films by wearing a white jump-suit made in 1972. Also they claimed he sang &#39;burning love&#39; which he first sung in 1972 and &#39;the wonder of you&#39; which he first recorded in 1970. They also claim that he got his first guitar for christmas when all Elvis fans know he got it for his birthday. I know all movies based on past have something false but these things are so obvious to people who like Elvis.

As a mother of 2 young children who are or should I say have been growing up with the many reincarnations of Scooby I feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of Scooby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If as a family we had not seen any episodes prior to Shaggy and Scooby get a clue we may have enjoyed it as a light weight, nothing special Saturday morning cartoon. But that in essence is the problem it is in it&#39;s current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of the &#34;old&#34; Scooby and gang. I&#39;m sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but I&#39;m sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost. My 6 year old son on seeing the new version was really disgruntled and without any prompting said that it looked really badly animated and why wasn&#39;t it anything like the last series(Where are you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scrappy Doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than this. Let&#39;s hope Get a clue will be apropos with reference to the producers.

I&#39;ve just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A bunch of kids, 14 to 22 put on the DVD of &#34;Titanic&#34; on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal. Only two of them had actually seen it before. But they all had seen the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epic started, they started to get restless, some of them left asking the others -- &#34;call us when the iceberg appears&#34; Over an hour and a half into the movie, only the two girls who had seen the movie before, were still there. They started shouting: iceberg, iceberg. A stampede followed, they all came back to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat open mouthed, emitting Ohs and far outs. So, just like I thought when the movie first burst into the scene. What is this? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it. Dr. Zivagho, for instance, had a similar running time, but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time. In &#34;Titanic&#34; Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the, supposedly, creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship. Look at the historical details, if you can find them. The storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink. The real sinking here is of film standards. All the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends. The film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so, what do I know?

Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre. Still, I did not like this one at all. About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life. Crappy sex scenes to follow. Why are they crappy, for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act. I mean we watch porn for the sex do we not. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to look at. Of course the girls in that one are very cute. Here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things. If you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film. The sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre...I mean there is a snake in one of them people. So for me this movie just fails as it does not excite me at all, but rather turns me off.

I&#39;m not sure why Spike Lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor Stevie Wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess. I also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional Blacks. The abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame. Scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes, play as if some college kid wrote this. I especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up Snipes. The overacting of the leads makes one feel as if Spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about. The final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in. This movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the F-word in casual conversation. I am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker. I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move. He should stick to making documentaries like the Four Little Colored Girls. Shock movies do not an Oscar make.

Johnny Knoxville has gone insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first Jackass he delighted in practical jokes more so than the physical stuff  his opening car rental gag and the later bit involving an air horn on a golf course were more akin to some type of extreme Candid Camera  but in Jackass: Number Two he&#39;s really off his rocker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with a sequence where he is chased through a living room by a bull, or later when he rides a rocket (a stunt which almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion from the side of the rocket), and especially when he stands willfully in front of a defense mechanism and takes a spray of pellets to the stomach, Knoxville is a madman. In the first film Bam Margera and Steve-O  notorious party animals  were the daring ones, but you know it&#39;s pretty bad when you see Knoxville enticing them to do a stunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is essentially a series of stunts pulled off by guys consumed by testosterone, constantly trying to one-up each other. It will eventually end in death for one of the cast members  in Jackass 2 Steve-O nearly loses a leg to a shark, Knoxville (as aforementioned) is nearly impaled with an explosion from a rocket, and so on and so forth. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed owing to the success of 2, and frankly I can&#39;t imagine any stunt out-performing the bull run in the opening scene of this film  that&#39;s incredible footage. It&#39;s almost unbelievable, and I wondered whether it had been faked, but apparently it was 100% genuine. (Which is actually kind of frightening.) And in terms of extremes Jackass 2 far outdoes its predecessor  it also feels more cinematic than the first film, with less of the cheesy titles preceding stunts that were made famous on the original MTV television show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the boys were given too much freedom here, and a good number of the gags are simply lame exercises in crudity  I can enjoy the occasional poop gag, but watching a man relieve himself on a miniature toilet, or see Steve-O take beer up the butt (yes, honestly), gets grating after a while. Even the frat boys in the screening I attended  who were enthusiastic when Wee Man took a playing card up the rear and got zapped by a rigged chair  were disgusted by some of the scenes in this film. It&#39;s not a matter of getting away with as much as possible  it&#39;s a matter of saying, &#34;Is this even entertaining or funny?&#34; Many times, sadly, it really isn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for every lame stunt involving fecal matter and farting on people&#39;s faces, there are some brilliant hidden-camera bits. Wacky director Spike Jonze (&#34;Adaptation&#34;) dresses up as an old woman and hits the streets naked, with sagging breasts and no shame. And my personal favorite skit involved Knoxville as an irresponsible old man, out for lunch with his grandson, letting him drink alcohol and smoke and swear and insult people. That&#39;s classic comedy taken to new extremes with the liberties of an R-rating. It&#39;s a shame they had to ruin all the great stuff  including a final segment involving an elaborate terrorist prank  with poop jokes along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, there&#39;s enough sheer spirit and craziness in this film to merit a viewing, and it&#39;s really taken the concept of extremity in cinema to new heights.

This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any &#39;80s&#39; movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And keeping with the classic 80&#39;s &#34;bad guy vs good guy&#34; movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! When Charlie runs out of ammo for the Heavy Machine gun, he runs back to his crib and takes up arms with his long range high caliber pistol! This pistol can stop a freakin ELEPHANT and Charlie is putting holes the size of hub caps into bad guys with it! And if that is not enough, Charlie is also packing an anti tank grenade launcher, which by the way, is only good if he can get the CREEPS clumped together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting in this movie is &#34;ha ha&#34; great and a lot of off the wall actors (mainly playing CREEPS) appear throughout the movie! The film is loaded with memorable one liners and scenes! Heck, my favorite scene/line is where the CREEP leader confronts Broson in Jail and calmly explains to him: &#34;Tell you what I am going to do ...I&#39;m gonna kill a little old lady ...just for you! ...catch it on the six o&#39;clock news&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this film violent? Heck yes! But, you&#39;ll laugh and cringe all the way through!!!!

The title says it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not a film critic nor will I act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this movie didn&#39;t have a multi-million dollar budget, but the plot was very well done, the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great! It looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie! I voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both, but I imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the DVD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll definitely be checking out other movies produced by Brain Damage Films! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan O&#39;Leary, cast and crew, I thank you!

I&#39;d never heard of this movie, but boy was I surprised when I caught it on TV. Great cast, great acting. Excellent movie! How can a movie with William H Macy, Neve Campbell and Donald Sutherland go wrong? I wonder why I never heard of it before.

John Travolta reprises his role as Chili Palmer, Hollywood gangster, who now turns his eye to the music business. Using his &#34;negotiation skills,&#34; he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and try to get his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I saw this sequel, I had heard that it was a terrible film. However, Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it&#39;s not as good as the original. The movie focuses on the music industry this time around instead of the movie industry. The music business is portrayed very poorly in the movie and they use a bunch of lame stereotypes. I can&#39;t tell if this was the intention or not since Get Shorty did a nice job of spoofing the movie industry. The same can&#39;t be said for the sequel and the attempts just come as lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it&#39;s nice to see him in a different type of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I was expecting more from her. John Travolta returns as Chili and he does an okay job. His performance is kind of dull though. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and she&#39;s also not that good of a singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance though he isn&#39;t in the film for very long. There are also a bunch of cameos including Steven Tyler and James Wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;F. Gary Gray directs and he does a poor job. He just doesn&#39;t handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. Also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots. The film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn&#39;t. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes. Sometimes, the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny. Compared to the original, the sequel doesn&#39;t measure up well. However, Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rental and that&#39;s it. Rating 6/10

THE MAN IN THE MOON is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950&#39;s. The main story follows a 14-year old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who develops a crush on a 17-year old neighbor (Jason London) who ends up falling for her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy alters this family&#39;s dynamics forever. The 1950&#39;s are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately. Witherspoon already begins to show the Oscar-winning talent she would develop in this early role and London makes a charming leading man. Warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well. Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper who play the girls&#39; parents and Gail Strickland, who plays London&#39;s mom. I was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase &#34;family ties.&#34;

It&#39;s remarkable that for &#39;Young Mr. Lincoln&#39;s&#39; supporting players Ford cast lesser known, other-than-star actors. This not only heightens his film&#39;s focus on the central character of Lincoln, but it also affords the audience a refreshing insight into Lincoln as a man of his place and time, a man embroiled, as each one of us inexorably is, in the issues and sentiments of his time and seeking his way to resolving them. It&#39;s not so much through Fonda&#39;s Lincoln&#39;s words and actions but in the faces, the reactions of the supporting players that Ford tells the story of the formation of the young Lincoln&#39;s worldview, sense of place in society and polity, and of how the people responded to Mr. Lincoln&#39;s words and deeds and placed their trust in this man whom they deemed to have earned their respect and heeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try: instead of focusing on Henry Fonda, next time you view &#39;Young Mr. Lincoln&#39; shift your focus to the supporting characters - you will, I expect, be handsomely rewarded with a more profound appreciation of both Lincoln and Ford. I like to suspect that Ford&#39;s storytelling through the supporting characters&#39; reactions to Fonda&#39;s Lincoln may have appealed to David Lean when he directed Omar Sharif in &#39;Doctor Zhivago&#39;, in which it&#39;s the supporting characters&#39; reactions to Zhivago that actually tell about Zhivago.

I knew next to nothing about this movie until I chanced to rent it. It was a very pleasant surprise. The cast is excellent including Matthau whom I do not normally care for. He makes a credible romantic lead. Hawn is a sweet kook and Bergman is touching as a woman coming out of her shell.

Chaplin stars in a dual role as a jewish barber who, with amnesia, is mistaken for the dictator Adenoid Hynkel, (i.e Hitler) A movie made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and was in no way won by the allies..it was banned in Germany by Hitler and was a risk in a way for Chaplin because if the war was lost, he surely wouldve been sent away to be &#34;reeducated&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A funny satire with the classic scene of Hitler tossing around a giant balloon of the world..good fun but with a message..a little preachy in the end. This was the last movie with Chaplin&#39;s trademark little mustache. on a scale of one to ten..9

Don&#39;t really know where to start with one of the worst films I have had the displeasure to watch in a very long time. From the setting which was quite obviously and very clear to anyone who has visited London for even 1 day will agree...was not London. To the much unexplained way how Snipe&#39;s character managed to escape the country back to the US without a single problem. Then he convinces the girl and grandmother to visit him in America, how on earth did Grandma agree to that...he&#39;s an assassin! Well that&#39;s the ending how about during the film, well unfortunately that didn&#39;t fare much better. We have British cops driving an amazing range of cars, I&#39;m sure it was an eighties Vauxhall Belmont which chased the taxi after the assignation, but a modern Subaru Imprezza escorting the prison van in a few scenes prior. SO19 or whoever the gun toting arm of the Met they were trying to portray was happily running around the streets with their guns out chasing after Snipe&#39;s along with the CIA. There were children walking around, but the police were still stating they had a clear shot to shoot him, does this happen in London? No it doesn&#39;t, I live there. We also have the very implausible travel from central London to the airport (let&#39;s say Heathrow for arguments sake) within 5 minutes of receiving a call. We also have terrible American accents, a young girl who&#39;s posher than the Queen, but lives in Elephant &amp; Castle. What does it say for British police when helicopters and a number of officers at Snipe&#39;s location can&#39;t find Snipe&#39;s and he manages to evade capture by hiding behind some stairs? The train station was obviously not even on UK soil and the fight scene sound effects were terrible. The plot was also extremely poor, boring and been written and filmed a lot better a thousand times before. But there were a few notable actors cast in this film, what were they thinking and please don&#39;t let that sway you to watch this film! This film didn&#39;t seem to know what it wanted to be, if you are going to concentrate on the dramatic aspects from the aftermath of an assignation then you need a strong rigid plot with plausible scenery and setting, this is something the viewer has time to take in and appreciate and if you do it wrong then you notice it. If you want an all out action film (which this is not) then continuity and scenery can be put to the side.

I think this movie lacks so much of substance, it is even not worth a discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first, the package is really disgusting. Especially the stereotype filming and photographing. Surely, Joe Dante&#39;s cinematic stile was appropriate and interesting in &#34;Gremlins&#34; and &#34;Small Soldiers&#34;, I mean the imaginative and visual pretty story telling of a Spielberg-wunderkind (I really loved these movies), but in &#34;Homecoming&#34; it was a completely failure. Attacks of toy soldiers and hairy creatures is simply not comparable with zombie-invasions (dead, stinky, rotten beings trying to kill the living - without any logical reason, just because they hate them). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zombie flicks are characteristic in plain, direct, unconventional and brutal cinematography. Nothing to be seen in Joe Dante&#39;s debut. Another point is the annoying content: really stupid dialogs between the two main characters, a gruesome exploitation of the &#34;elder brother dies and leaves the younger traumatized&#34; and bad acting. And, by the way &#34;Homecoming&#34; is neither scary, nor gory - and even less entertaining. You see, it is even not a horror movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zombie movies in the decade of their birth - it the end of 60s/ start of the 70s - used to be revolutionary, provocative (espicially through its gruesome, explicit content) and of subtle social critic. THE ORIGINAL Zombie film was actually a midnight-movie named &#34;Night of the Living Dead&#34; (1968). This one was a low budget movie that covered so many controversial themes, it&#39;s hard to name them all: a visual style of Hitchcock/Raimi, the American lifestyle of the 70s, political aloofness, the upcoming breakthrough of the human rights of black people and the even more upcoming racism as a result on the side of the conservative Americans (remember the shooting of the black main character in the end of the movie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in the creativity of midnight movies and want to learn more about the most important ones, I recommend you &#34;Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream &#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So steer clear of &#34;Homecoming&#34; and even so of Romero&#39;s &#34;Land of the Dead&#34;.

There is nothing good to say about this movie. Read Revolution For the Hell of It or any of his other writings. Abbie was often dismissed as the clown-prince of the &#39;60&#39;s, but he was a man of ideas who used his cleverness, his sense of humor and pop culture, and his flamboyant personality to get attention to his ideas. The media too often concentrated on the man, not the ideas, and that&#39;s the problem with this movie, too. Later in his life he did suffer from depression. But this flick is like a National Enquirer version of Abbie. He deserves better. If you don&#39;t know Abbie or his times, this movie won&#39;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This film lies. I give it a zero. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Stars: Hayden Pantierre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been so many movies that have this exact same plot, and this one is just a poor rehashing of it. Populer white girl moves to ethnic school, doesn&#39;t fit in, soon becomes accepted. Originality is nonexistent in this, and neither are the laughs. It uses so many old poorly executed jokes it&#39;s annoying. I don&#39;t know why they think it&#39;s a good idea to make made for video sequels to mediocre films, but it isn&#39;t. With that said, the positives in this are that all the people in it are fairly competent actors and actresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating: * out of ****. PG-13 for Language and Sexual Humor.

Here&#39;s example number 87,358 of Hollywood&#39;s anti-Biblical bias, so typical of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early on, Ray Liotta&#39;s wife has did and women are being interviewed for the position of housekeeper. The first interviewee is an old-fashioned-looking (dress, mannerisms, speech) who immediately lays down here strict rules, stating that &#34;there will be two hours of Bible study ever day.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is said, of course, to make it sound like reading the Bible is the worse punishment you could ever inflict on someone, especially a kid. Once again, the Bible is equated with stuffy, mean-spirited people. That woman, of course, is dismissed immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, the liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg - who else?) is the one who is hired and, voilà, saves the day! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yawn.

I love this movie so much. It always makes me cry. If you appreciate Drew Barrymore half as much as I do, you&#39;ll love this movie. It&#39;s got all the essentials I look for in a movie. It has good actors, good characters, good humor...a lot of heart-warming moments too. The flash-back moments when we see Josie in high school make me cry though. Every single time. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll like this one, don&#39;t judge based on the fact that it looks like a teen movie, even though it is, in a way, a teen movie. Sure, if you&#39;re a guy, and all you watch are hardcore special effect movies only in the top 250 movies of all time, then this isn&#39;t for you. But if you like romantic comedies you will not forget after seeing it, pick it up at a video store and enjoy: Drew Barrymore is great in this one!

The credits come from the Sandy Frank stitching job that was made to turn this movie into Cave Dwellers for re-release. Now that that&#39;s cleared up...oh! Excruciating, eye-gouging pain. Blade Master leaps shamelessly on the sword &amp; sorcery bandwagon started by the Conan flicks...except the bandwagon never left the garage anyway. As such, this Italian flick is a dud trying to rip-off a box office dud, with predictable results. However, this would give too little credit to the director and writers, who make no effort whatsoever to maintain a coherent plot, continuity, any semblance of era-accurate continuity. Miles O&#39;Keefe is no leading man, now or forever (Tarzan The Ape Man proved that, if Ator didn&#39;t). Just an unlikeable picture and a chore to watch.

i just saw this movie on TV..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#39;ve lost my dad when i was young and this movie surely did touch me..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can feel the lost that the little girl Desi felt..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the feeling of wanting to see her father again..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wanting to talk to him..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or at least given the chance to say goodbye..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and i&#39;m so touched with the letter that was wrote back to her..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;saying that her father read her letter, and sent it back to someone to reply her and buy her a present because there isn&#39;t a shop in heaven..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it just lets me feel that miracles do exist..

This is listed as a documentary, it&#39;s not, it&#39;s filmed sort of like a documentary but that I suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming. This has just been released in the UK on DVD as an &#34;American Pie style comedy&#34; it&#39;s not that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to Mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid. Throw is a couple of dwarfs, also on the same sort of quest and you have a non-hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the 18 Rating this has very little nudity, and practically zero sex scenes, mainly I guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like crude Jackass behaviour without the humour, then this may be your thing, if you have any brain cells left then I would probably avoid this!

Reading the other two comments, I had to wonder if I had seen the same movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps life is drastically different in Australia, but, wow - call it sci-fi or fantasy, but people just don&#39;t act like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#39;t pass up this review without commenting on it myself.. it gets better after the first half hour, but I doubt most could make it that far..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yikes.

Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood worst overrated movies ever. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers making period related movie gives a rubbish movie. The songs were boring and ain&#39;t the kind of song you want to listen to in your car, full volume. Sunny Deol is famous for making daft movies, where he beats up a 100 bad guys on his own. He even kicks a metal jail door (Indian) and kicks a moving car far away (Teesri Aankh). I can give another 50 examples of disgraceful action by Sunny Deol. But I&#39;m sure most people know this already. Sunny gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same type of role. A guy claiming to be fighting for his countries piece, by using violence. Amisha Patel is hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that i would love to bone. But even she couldn&#39;t save the film from being a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does, in this movie she doesn&#39;t. Maybe cos she was playing a Muslim, but she doesn&#39;t act like one in the movie. Overall, this is a poor show all the way, I&#39;m sure it will appeal to some people, who love seeing the Bollywood actor beat up 100 guys. Give me a break.

Okay, maybe this movie not a revolution. But it a very good piece of entertainment, and it&#39;s Liv Tyler&#39;s variation of Alicia Silverstone&#39;s &#34;Clueless&#34; or Cameron Diaz&#39; &#34;There&#39;s something about Mary&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liv plays a femme fatale, which just wants to have an own house and all kinds of material comfort in it. And well she does everything to get just that... even crimes. Many crimes. And she drops every boyfriend which doesn&#39;t cooperate to get these things. Additionally, she actually doesn&#39;t mind to have some additional lovers beside her current boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is even funnier to watch if one knows that Liv is actually of zodiac sign cancer - and cancer are reported to be very domestic. So the character Liv played here is actually a parody of a cancer !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was alone in cinema when I watched this one. That was quite comfortable because I could laugh as loud as I wished all the time - but it also felt strange, as if nobody was actually interested in this movie ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself liked it very much. The acting was between very good to excellent, especially the main actors where brilliant. There where enough jokes, many of the black kind, and good dialogues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a trash movie, and it is full of black humor. If you like this kind of movies, try this one !

I want to say that I went to this movie with my expectations way too high. I thought it was going to be funny because it&#39;s the sequel to Bruce Almighty which was really funny and it stars Steve Carell who is an excellent comedic actor but boy, did it sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is advertised as a sequel but it really has nothing to do with the original since the only people reprising their roles are Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell but Steve&#39;s character is completely different, he is no longer the jerk he was in the first one here he is a nice guy. The story is different and the actors are different and it&#39;s not funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the actors involved(Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Ed Helms and even Jon Stewart in a very crappy cameo) have talent but none of them seems to use it and it looks that there in the movie just for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the plot is obviously shaped after Noah&#39;s story but there are so many wrong things with it, I don&#39;t know where to start. I guess the big problem is that in the everyone around Evan thinks that he is crazy despite all the things that are happening to him, he grows a huge white beard in two days, he gets help from animals from all around the world, he builds a giant arc in a few weeks, in real life people wouldn&#39;t be mocking these guy after that, they would be saying he is the new Noah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the special effects are good but what the hell is the greatest movie flood ever filmed doing in Evan Almighty? Did they really had to waste such good special effects as filler for this crappy movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Carrey seems to be a smart guy since he has stayed away of three of the worst sequels ever made, Son of the Mask, Dumb and Dumbered and now Evan Almighty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a giant disappointment and Tom Shyadac should be ashamed of himself.

I originally saw this very dark comedy around 2000 or so on cable TV. What a surprise and delight! Everyone is covertly armed in this movie! Dreyfuss plays the &#34;mental&#34; don (remember the New York don who was supposed to be schizophrenic? Art imitates life or vice-versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are at their most beautiful and NOT to be toyed with! Thus proving that beauty and toughness DO go together! Then there is the great &#34;bullshit&#34; scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) where they verbally play off the world &#34;bullshit.&#34; This film is both subtle and bald. For all the shooting, it can be a very quiet film. And, you have the opportunity to see several actors in their final or near final roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. It is not a film for everyone. But, if you like a film that has a lot of word play and keeps moving without blowing up everything in sight, this is the film for you. Roger Ebert dumps on this film. He&#39;s flat wrong. THIS is a fine, fine film! Maybe just not one for Ebert. I consider it as a 10 because of how well it is done and how funny the script can be, while not really being a straight comedy kind of film. I like it so well that I bought it on DVD because it just doesn&#39;t get shown very much on cable TV. Now, it&#39;s all mine!

Wonderfully put together..I wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost...there should be a part two..a real one. It was great..the film wasn&#39;t long enough..I would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up!! this is so important to the community period..well if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this sort...I am really tired of hearing from naive writers how AIDS and Men go together when they don&#39;t; actually its the hetero&#39;s that we need to look into..this film didn&#39;t even bother to mention HIV or AIDS and I was so glad for that..I really appreciated the break downs and definitions too. Thank you s much for allowing this film to exist.

I thought watching employment videos on corporate compliance was tedious. This movie went nowhere fast. What could have been a somewhat cheesy half hour twilight zone episode turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people parking their cars, a picture of some dude&#39;s swimming pool (he really needs to answer his phone by the way) a dot matrix printer doing its job, and Heuy and Louey sitting in a yellow lighted control room repeating &#34;T minus 10 and counting&#34; as if something exciting is going to happen. It doesn&#39;t so don&#39;t get your hopes up. The best thing about this movie is to see James Best and Gerald McC, in something other than there famous TV personalities, and that is stretching to find anything good. And do NOT get me started on the music which was totally composed of a Tympani, some large marine mammals, and microphone feedback. This movie is as close as I have given a one yet, but it gets the 2 because I actually was able to finish this insomnia cure, and didn&#39;t have to leave in the middle. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Kevin Tenney&#39;s &#34;Night of the Demons&#34; is an enjoyable horror film that reminds me a little bit &#34;The Evil Dead&#34;.On Hallowen night,a group of teens throws a party in Hull House,an abandoned funeral home on the outskirts of town.Lead by Angela,they perform a seance-like ceremony and accidentally awaken the evil spirits that inhabit the place.One by one,the uninvited evil force possesses the teens,turning them into bloodthirsty demons.&#34;Night of the Demons&#34; is a perfect horror film.It is scary,gory and pretty atmospheric.The characters are well-developed and the gore by Steve Johnson is pretty good.There is a gruesome impaling,a tongue being bitten off,fingers shoved into eye-sockets,etc.The scene,where Suzanne(Linnea Quigley)shoves a tube of lipstick through her nipple is a hoot.Give this one a look.Followed by two sequels.

Kurt Thomas in one of the series of gymnast olympic stars turned movie stars movies that mercifully only includes one other..Mitch Gaylord in American Anthem...at least that one had Janet Jones..this one has...um... a gymnast using his martial arts and his gymnastic skills to save a european country from dictatorship..sure it could happen.. on a scale of one to ten.. a 0

Who likes awful &#34;comedy&#34; shows like Little Mosque on the Prairie? The only two kinds of people I can think of who watch this are: One, Muslims and self-proclaimed Liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about Muslims that it doesn&#39;t even matter if the show is good or funny at all (which it is not). Two, old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable, badly written, stale jokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CBC needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is. If they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen, their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left. I&#39;d be curious who even writes for this show? Do you think it&#39;s actually Muslims, or hip, funny young people? No, I bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you look at the CBC comedy shows there are, Air Farce was only finally just taken off the air (thank goodness!) but we still have lame ducks like This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer that we are paying for, not to mention this poor excuse for &#34;comedy&#34; Little Mosque on the Prairie. It is supposed to be offencive and funny? Only the CBC would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny. Shame on the CBC for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching.

I went to see this 3 nights ago here in Cork, Ireland. It was the world premiere of it, in the tiny cinema in the Triskel Arts Centre as part of the Cork Film Festival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found &#34;Strange Fruit&#34; to be an excellent movie. It is a bit rough around the edges, but for a low-budget movie that is to be expected! In general the acting (particularly from the main lead Kent Faulcon) is wonderful, the cinematography and direction excellent, and the script hugely entertaining and thought-provoking, with some nice set-ups and witty dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending was a bit sudden, with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end ... but perhaps that&#39;s what the filmmakers were going for? It certainly did make the movie more unsettling. I did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen: it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will, as in real-life sometimes these things are never settled. This was a good choice, to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taut and suspenseful throughout, &#34;Strange Fruit&#34; is a hugely ambitious debut and I have high hopes for what the writer/director Kyle Schickner will unleash next. He - and his colleagues - are a talent worth watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope &#34;Strange Fruit&#34; gets a wider release soon, as more people deserve to see this movie, an above-average thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in America&#39;s Deep South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended: 7/10

This film is cringingly bad. You can tell that all the actors are embarrassed to be associated with such a truly terrible movie. There are obvious budget constraints but with a little thought and attention to detail the movie could have been so much better. For example: check out the scene where Mickey first goes to the mortuary and is talking to his friend the pathologist whilst the murdered taxi driver is lying on the slab. You can actually see the corpse breathing! What, couldn&#39;t they afford to hire a half-decent extra that could hold his breath for a 2 minute scene?!

I know sometimes its really really corny... But the acting is amazing and Melissa Joan Hart is as cute as a button. I love this show a lot, and I&#39;m almost embarrassed that I do b/c the show has a rep. for being really corny, but it makes me feel good. My only problem is that sometimes it can be pretty low budget - sometimes actors change and you just have to deal with it... Like Sabrina&#39;s father is 2 different guys throughout the course of the movie... I mean, couldn&#39;t they just say he was an uncle or something? Still, I can&#39;t help but loving this show. Harvey and Sabrina make a really cute couple and Salem is absolutely hilarious. I definitely recommend it if your looking for some light and funny entertainment... My favorite episode is &#34;Pancake Madness&#34;... a HILARIOUS episode. The best season is probably 3... I&#39;m not really a fan of some of the seventh season twists... Once you get to college, Morgan joins the group and her dialog is painful and very poorly acted... Plus she is ugly, so the jokes about how she is only surviving off her good looks were lost on me... But I think it was set up to have a really good eighth season and I was really sad to see one of my favorite shows canceled!

It&#39;s refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily just like almost every other American movie, and then be surprised when that doesn&#39;t happen. I like a happy ending as much as the next guy, but sometimes it&#39;s better to portray things in a more realistic manner, and I thought Brokedown Palace did this very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending, with one friend basically sacrificing herself for the other, thus redeeming her earlier poor behavior which got them into the situation in the first place, was very moving. I almost rather would have done without the last line, which proved that she didn&#39;t actually do the deed she confessed to, because that would have made the movie more about the friendship between the two girls, and less about the crime. Whether she did it or not wasn&#39;t that important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story itself bordered on the cliché, but the actresses kept my attention with their excellent performances. Very realistic, very captivating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 out of 10.

After watching Awake,I led to a conclusion:director and screenwriter Joby Harold made Awake with the intention of laughing at the spectator,for the simple fact the movie is full of ridiculous elements.Awake has a lot of plot holes and it is full of absurd and ridiculous elements(for example,the hospital uniform the spirit of the main character uses...did the ghost of a doctor leave it in the floor ?).The concept behind this movie is slightly ingenious but all the plot holes and the absurd things make of this a stupid and crappy film.With the exception of the great Lena Olin,all the actors bring bad performances.Hayden Christensen has zero expressions and the same applies for Jessica Alba.The extraordinary actor Terrence Howard is enormously wasted on his role.Awake makes a laugh of the spectator.It&#39;s so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it&#39;s impossible to take it seriously.My recommendation is:skip this crappy movie.

This is a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex who she loved so much was probably dead, but really his scientist dad had just put a spell on him to turn him into this really cute shark-guy. Kind of like in Beauty and the Beast. It could probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe some singing candlesticks, but there are some pretty gross plants instead. They make this one girl really itchy, so she lets herself get eaten by the shark-guy instead of scratching through the whole movie. The scientist guy is a good dad who tries to reunite his fishy shark son with the woman he was engaged to, he even arranges for them to have private time for s-e-x, but the woman in this is a really shallow snob and thinks the shark-guy is an ugly, icky monster and wants nothing to do with him. She gave up on love! Just because he was a shark! I thought it was pretty sad how all she had to do was kiss him and he&#39;d turn back to normal and they&#39;d live happily ever after, but it&#39;s not that kind of movie.

This is a true &#34;feel-good&#34; movie, full of genuine sweetness and admirable people. Although the premise requires a significant suspension of disbelief, it is worth the trouble to do so. The director, writers, and actors truly convey what it feels like to be in love.

Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I stumbled upon this movie version in the late 90&#39;s I was ecstatic! This is the best and most complete version of the book on film! This version is a little long to sit through in one sitting but well worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing as Rochester. I was glad that they cast a normal looking actress (Zelah Clark) as Jane and not a glamorous person. I love the sets and the location. For anyone who is a true Jane Eyre fan, this is the version to watch!!! For those of you who are interested, I just found this version on DVD. I have watched my VHS copy almost to breaking so I was thrilled to find it on DVD.

&#34;So there&#39;s this bride, you see, and she gets crushed to death by this statue that falls on her on the day of her wedding. Then, get this, a year later, her former fiancé falls in love with a beautiful psychic and then, that beautiful psychic gets haunted by the ghost of the disgruntled dead bride who wants to keep her from stealing her boyfriendhe heit&#39;ll be hilarious!.&#34; Polite chuckling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, I like to envision, is how Jeff Lowell, the man who dreamed up &#34;Over Her Dead Body,&#34; presented his concept to the studio execs over there at New Line Cinema. The big mystery is how those very same corporate bigwigs could then turn right around and green light the project, allowing Lowell to direct the film as well as write the screenplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For if you think that no movie could ever possibly be as bad as this original premise sounds, then clearly you have another think coming. The only way in which it might have worked is if the writer had simply gone crazy with it and turned it into a no-holds-barred satirical farce. Instead, wanting to ensure that he delivered a fuzzy, inoffensive and warmhearted romantic comedy, Lowell engages in boring half-measures every step of the way, tamping down the absurdity in favor of drab conventionality. Indeed, &#34;Over Her Dead Body&#34; is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it&#39;s hard to know where exactly Lowell thought he was going with it. Virtually every set-up, joke and sight gag in the film is flat-footed and poorly executed, with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their predicament. How else to explain the halfhearted, lifeless performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose not to blame the actors, some of whom have proved their talents in better vehicles in the past (that is particularly the case with Rudd). But Lowell and those studio execs sure have some &#39;splainin&#39; to do.

Michael Winner is probably best known for his revenge-themed films, such as &#34;Death Wish&#34; and &#34;Chato&#39;s Land&#34;, but he is equally gifted as a director of occult Horror cinema, as &#34;The Sentinel&#34; of 1977 proves. &#34;The Sentinel&#34;, which is based on a novel by John Konvitz, who also wrote the screenplay, is a clever and immensely creepy religious chiller that no lover of occult Horror should consider missing. The film is obviously inspired by successful occult classics such as &#34;Rosemary&#39;s Baby&#34;, &#34;The Exorcist&#34; or &#34;The Omen&#34;, but, as far as I am concerned, it is also easily as unsettling as these more widely acclaimed films, and probably even creepier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allison Parker (Christina Raines) is a beautiful young New York model. Traumatized by events in her her past and not yet willing to marry her lawyer boyfriend (Chris Sarandon), Allison is in search for an apartment, and finds a big, incredibly nice one, which is also affordable, in an old mansion in Brooklyn. The new apartment, however, comes along with a bunch of very strange other tenants. And the sinister new neighbors soon become more than a little bothersome to Alice... This may not be an adequate plot synopsis, but I would hate to spoil any of this film&#39;s great moments, so I will not give any further plot description. What I will say, however, is that &#34;The Sentinel&#34; is a very creepy and effective film that profits from a great cast as well as an often bizarre and constantly uncanny atmosphere. The fact that director Michael Winner and writer John Konnvitz also acted as producers here certainly had its influence on the outcome. The film is imaginatively photographed, and the eerie old Brooklyn mansion is a fantastic setting for this kind of film. As mentioned above, the atmosphere is obscure and creepy, and the film also includes several shock-moments and genuine scares. The film features many sinister and eccentric characters, and the cast is superb. Beautiful Christina Raines is great in her role of Allison Parker, lovable and yet on the cusp to losing her mind. Chris Sarandon is also very good as her boyfriend, a successful lawyer, and the supporting cast includes many big names, such as Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum, Jerry Orbach, Beverly D&#39;Angelo and Tom Berenger, before becoming really famous. The cast also includes stars like Ava Gardner, Horror icon John Carradine, Burgess Meredith, and, my personal favorite, the great Eli Wallach as a cynical homicide detective. I&#39;ve been a great fan of director Michael Winner for a long time, mostly for films like &#34;Death Wish&#34; and &#34;Chato&#39;s Land&#34;. &#34;The Sentinel&#34; is yet another great film in Winner&#39;s repertoire, and also the proof that the man is not only a master of hard-boiled revenge-cinema, but also of atmospheric occult Horror. All in all, &#34;The Sentinel&#34; is a creepy, intelligent, and amazingly bizarre occult chiller that is highly recommended to all Horror fans!

Jessica Bohl plays Daphne, the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school. Daphne&#39;s neighbor is Buddy (Richard Brundage), a depressed middle-aged man still angry over loosing his wife. Daphne is attracted to world of prostitution because it promises to cure her of barely legal boredom and loneliness. Once Buddy strips Daphne of her secret, he hires her to help him accept the loss of his wife. The entire film takes place at the Hotel Duncan, yet details of each character&#39;s history are exposed through dialogue and flashbacks. Their appointment climaxes with the story&#39;s concluding twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance. Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film&#39;s dialogue is natural, real to life. The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate. Daphne is intelligent, yet clearly still an eighteen year old. Buddy may be middle-aged, but still not the hackneyed naïve type normally depicted in film. Daphne and Buddy&#39;s conversation primarily deals with their despair and frustration with life, but is still comical at the right times. Although the general mood is very relaxed, the dialogue has its own vivacity, forcing the audience to become empathetic toward the character&#39;s conditions and uncomfortable at their straightforward vulgarities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film. Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters. Even existing independently from the film, the compilation truly expresses You Are Alone&#39;s central theme-- loneliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You Are Alone is a less conventional piece that deals with of notions typically not spoken. Definitely worth seeing it&#39;s the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.

When I first saw this film, I thought it should have come from the children&#39;s section - It&#39;s very fun and at times humorous, and is actually quite a good story, but it severely lacks the &#34;romantic chemistry&#34; that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are capable of delivering. I must note that Walter Matthau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein, and his performance is extraordinary, but that&#39;s the sole exception. This film appears a bit forced, the directing lacks substance, and oh yeah...the music is ridiculously awful, it didn&#39;t put me in a very good mood. But if you are not expecting a smart, well-crafted comedy/romance tale, then this certainly can be entertaining, like I said..it should be in the children&#39;s section. Einstein and his buddies are a good relief from Tim Robbins&#39; boring, almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryan&#39;s heart. A very conflicting film, but as long as it&#39;s not taken seriously this can be an alright movie.

It&#39;s a bit easy. That&#39;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but that&#39;s forgiveable. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are magnificant. Everything from the speaking to the SFX are pleasant and realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it&#39;s the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times.

After seeing this film I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound-track or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty. For at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background 20&#39;s music and the scratchiness of the sound-track. I was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so - it was the Director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film. The music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film. These days, directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film (which you can find out for yourself elsewhere) the sound-track distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss. You will only hear the distorted scratchiness of the sound-track and certainly not a cat&#39;s meow.

Billed as Takashi Miike&#39;s &#34;first family film&#34; - by people who haven&#39;t seen Zebraman, presumably. YOKAI DAISENSO takes things even further in the direction of family-friendliness, diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale. A young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware. The film is evidently bigger budget than anything else Miike has done, with lots of CGI to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures (the YOKAI). Perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors, but I think it&#39;s probably just that he wanted to do something different. He&#39;s really never been a one-trick pony, but often gets accused of it - perhaps YOKAI is designed to silence those critics. Regardless, it&#39;s a great project for Miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s a very cartoonish feel to the production, evoking thoughts of Miyazaki in places. The Yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on Japanese folk tales, which certainly influenced Miyazaki as well (particularly SPIRITED AWAY). It must remembered that Miike has nothing like the budget of a Harry Potter film to work with, so the special effects aren&#39;t going to be seamless Hollywood style work - some blue-screening is especially obvious. Some of the special effects are great though, with some very well animated creatures (a mix of CG, stop-motion and puppetry). I think the little sock-puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was *meant* to look really cheap, and is all the cuter for it :) The young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job - it&#39;s so hard to find a pre-teen who actually understands the concept of acting, but 9 year old Ryunosuke Kamiki is a genuine talent (I see he did voices in the last 2 Miyazaki films!). Chiaki Kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece, though Mai Takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixie-eared River Princess - yum yum! Those looking for another violent, perverted gangster film aren&#39;t going to find what they&#39;re looking for in YOKAI, but if you&#39;re a fan of Miike because of his imagination and wit, there&#39;s plenty to satisfy here. And it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you&#39;ve got :)

For his last film, John Huston directed his daughter, Anjelica, in this adaptation of the story from James Joyce&#39;s &#34;Dubliners&#34;, and he gave us one of his finest achievements to remember him by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyce is about as impossible to film as anyone, but &#34;The Dead&#34; at least presents a traditional narrative to work with. Much (indeed, almost all) of the important information in the story lies in the spaces between the lines, in characters&#39; thoughts and expressions -- there are big moments, but they&#39;re cerebral -- they&#39;re not the stuff of which movies are made. But somehow, Huston gets it right, and he manages a nearly flawless adaptation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anjelica is magnificent, and the movie is haunting and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A

In a way, Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal : being seen by thousands. But it fails at making them laugh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Les Visiteurs has had its success, because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel : forget about Zemeckis&#39;s Back to the future, here comes the old France, the middle-age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life. Full of pride, funny thanks to the ancient words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor. Then comes the sequel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it&#39;s no use being a movie expert to realize that the Corridors of Time has been made for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs, and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought. Explanation : it&#39;s no use trying to get back the jewelry Jacquouille has stolen ; don&#39;t you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode ? Where do you think he found the money ? Selling the jewelry... And that&#39;s only one of many holes Poiré tries to avoid... and fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s have a look at the characters : Montmirail doesn&#39;t change, he&#39;s just a little more boring. Regarding Frenegonde... that&#39;s another story : Valérie Lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so pitiful I nearly felt pain for her. And Poiré doesn&#39;t realize that a cast of humorists isn&#39;t enough to make a good comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget about the time travels, about the digital effects, concentrate on the story and you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main interest of this film is the landscapes. A movie for youngsters, let&#39;s say up to 13 years old.

A group of friends come face-to-face with a family of hideous cannibals whilst camping in the beautiful German countryside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#39;mutant cannibal family&#39; concept is almost as old as the hills that the inbred freaks often call home, so any director attempting to breath new life into the genre needs to come up with something pretty darn special in order to impress. With Barricade, Timo Rose tries to give the well-worn routine a Teutonic twist, by transplanting the action to The Black Forest and giving it the German low-budget splatter treatment. The result is a very bloody, but totally unoriginal effort that is made almost unwatchable thanks to some dreadful directorial decisionsin particular, the non-stop use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had Timo Rose not opted to utilise every naff trick his editing software offered him, then Barricade might have been a reasonably entertaining gore-fest: his inexperienced cast do reasonably well; the bloody effects are suitably stomach churning; and there are one or two scares and even some well conceived creepy moments. All of this, however, is completely ruined by the awful camera-work, choppy editing, and overwhelming barrage of visual gimmickry used to give the film the distressed look that is so inexplicably popular with today&#39;s film-makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Barricade 3 out of 10 purely for the outlandish gore, which includes a nifty scene where a guy is forced to drink acid, loads of nasty wounds caused by a variety of sharp implements, and some pretty decent shotgun damage.

&#34;The Beguiled&#34; is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood films, and a departure from his typical early roles. Directed by Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood collaborated on several films, it was made a year before Eastwood&#39;s directorial debut with &#34;Play Misty For Me&#34;. An alternate title considered for the film was &#34;Pussy-Footing Down At The Old Plantation&#34;, which thankfully was not used, otherwise I am sure raunchy jokes about the fact that it takes place at a girls&#39; school would be difficult to avoid. I first saw this movie in one of my college film classes in the mid-1970&#39;s, and was immediately taken with it. I only had an old battered VHS tape of it until I recently purchased the widescreen DVD, which also includes the hilarious, awful trailer that makes the film come across as a &#34;Peyton Place&#34; soap opera, and conveys none of the creepiness of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting notes: Eastwood and Siegel had to battle with Universal Pictures to keep the original ending, and they won out; and, the film was billed as a standard Eastwood western, which it certainly is not. It is a Gothic tale of deception and horror set in the time of the Civil War, with an underlying tone of eroticism and sexual tension running throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not putting any spoilers in this review, and if you want to see the film as it should be seen, then be careful of looking it up on the internet, as spoiler reviews of it do abound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clint Eastwood portrays John McBurney, a Union soldier who is shot on Confederate ground and discovered by a young girl from a nearby girls&#39; school. She rescues him and takes him back to the school, but instead of notifying the local patrol of his presence so that he will be taken to prison, the headmistress, Miss Martha (Geraldine Page), her assistant Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), their black servant Hallie (Mae Mercer), and the mostly teenage girls take him in, heal him, and fall under his spell. The film sets its tone of creepiness and Gothic horror right from the titles, as it shows real battleground shots from the war, while Eastwood&#39;s voice is heard quietly singing a funereal song of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening scene of his encounter with the little girl who saves him sets the tone of his character, and the tone of the entire movie. To say any more than that would spoil the surprises in that first scene. To say much more about the film itself might ruin it for anyone who hasn&#39;t seen it...if you are into creepy, Gothic tales, find it and rent it. Eastwood is excellent in the film, and it is interesting to see him in an early role, or any role, where he portrays a character that is for the most part very unsympathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geraldine Page had a plum role in the film as the headmistress, and I cannot imagine another actress of the time being as good in the role; a long shot could have been Piper Laurie, but I don&#39;t think Laurie could have embodied the role in the same manner as Geraldine Page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Hartman (whose wonderful performance in the film &#34;A Patch of Blue&#34; as a blind girl who falls in love with Sidney Poiter&#39;s character is another high point in her short career) is at her prime here, delicate and masterful at the same time. Unfortunately, her delicacy on film was also a part of her real life; she committed suicide at age 45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I end this review with this observation: one manipulative, lying Yankee man is no match for a houseful of deceptive and libidinous Southern belles.

I just saw this film at the 2001 Toronto international film festival. The working title there was &#39;Dog Days&#39;. The audience reaction was mixed. Some people found the graphic sex and realistic violence to be too much for them. Others seemed to genuinely appreciate how good this film was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film isn&#39;t for the faint of heart. It&#39;s like &#39;Happiness&#39; with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. There&#39;s animal poisoning, a strip-tease from a senior citizen, an orgy&#39;esque&#39; bathouse in a shopping centre, anal candle penetration, and the molestation of the mentally incompetent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of this sounds like too much to handle then this film isn&#39;t for you. This film shows humanity at its most desperate and pathetic. The banality of our existence is shoved in our face with utmost glee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Seidl has no interest in redeeming humanity here. And why should he? This film features excellent performances from all involved, is always interesting, and is probably the most intelligent social statement to be made on film in awhile.

Nothing&#39;s more enjoyable for me than a who-dun-it or suspense tale that keeps you guessing throughout as to how the whole thing will end. And that&#39;s precisely what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on a chilling play by Ira Levin (&#34;Rosemary&#39;s Baby&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in it, MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE get to do the kind of stunt that Caine and Laurence Olivier pulled off in SLEUTH--with just about as much skill and as many puzzles as ever existed in that extraordinarily clever play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But because it&#39;s meant to scare you, surprise you, and keep you guessing as to the outcome, it&#39;s difficult to write a review about the plot. Let&#39;s just say that what we know in the beginning is all you have to know about the film for the present. MICHAEL CAINE is an insanely jealous playwright whose latest play has failed miserably. When a young aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends him the manuscript of his play, Caine realizes that passing it off as his own would solve all his problems and get his reputation back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From that point on, it&#39;s a matter of fun and games for the audience as Ira Levin&#39;s story unwinds, managing to trump Agatha Christie for the number of twists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caine and Reeve play off each other brilliantly, each bringing a certain dynamic tension to the tale as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that laces drama with humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summing up: Well worth seeing--but not everyone is pleased with the ending.

With Iphigenia, Mikhali Cacoyannis is perhaps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient Greek theatre to the screen. His own screenplay, an adaptation of Euripides&#39; tragedy, was far from easy, compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed. The story has been very carefully deconstructed from Euripides&#39; version and placed in a logical, strictly chronological framework, better conforming to the modern methods of cinematic story-telling. Cacoyannis also added some characters to his film that do not appear in Euripides&#39; tragedy: Odysseus, Calchas, and the army. This was done in order to make some of Euripides&#39; points regarding war, the Church, and Government clearer. Finally, Cacoyannis&#39; Iphigenia ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to Euripides&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film was shot on location at Aulis. The director of photography, Giorgos Arvanitis, shows us a rugged but beautiful Greece, where since the Homeric days time seems to have stood still. He takes advantage of the bodies, the arid land, the ruins, the intense light and the darkness. The harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters. The camera uses the whole gamut of available shots, from the very long, reinforcing the vastness and desolation of the landscape, as well as the human scale involved, to the extreme close-ups, dissecting and probing deep into the soul of the tormented characters. In particular, the film&#39;s opening, with a bold, accelerating tracking shot along a line of beached boats, followed by an aerial view of the many thousands of soldiers lying listlessly on the beach, is a very effective means of communicating Agamemnon&#39;s awesome political and military responsibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No word but &#34;sublime&#34; can describe the stunning performances of Costa Kazakos (Agamemnon), Irene Papas (Clytemnestra), and Tatiana Papamoschou (Iphigenia). Kazakos and Papas embody the sublimity of the classical Greece tragedy. Kazakos&#39; character is extremely down-to-earth, and his powerful look into the camera, more than his words, reveals the unbelievable torment tearing his soul. Irene Papas is the modern quintessence of classic Greek plays. In Iphigenia, she is terrible in her anguish, and even more so for what we know will be her vengeance. Tatiana Papamoskou, in her first role on the screen, is outstanding in her portray of the innocent Iphigenia, which contrasts with Kazakos&#39; austere depiction of her father, Agamemnon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cacoyannis is faithful to Euripides in his representation of the other characters: Odysseus is a sly, scheming politician, Achilles, a vain, narcissistic warrior, Menalaus is self centered, obsessed with his honor, eager to be avenged, and to have his wife and property restored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The costumes and sets are realistic: no Hollywood there. Agamemnon&#39;s quarters resembles a barn, he dresses, as do the others, in utilitarian, hand-woven, simple garb. Clytemnestra&#39;s royal caravan is made up of rough-hewn wooden carts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music is by the prolific contemporary music composer Mikis Theodorakis. Theodorakis&#39; score intensifies the dramatic and cinematographic unfolding, reflects on the psychological aspect of the tragedy, and accentuates its dimensions and actuality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film and the story it narrates offer considerable insight into the lost world of ancient Greek thought that was the crucible for so much of our modern civilization. It teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures. Euripides questions the value of war and patriotism when measured against the simple virtues of family and love, and reflects on woman&#39;s vulnerable position in a world of manly violence. In his adaptation of Euripides&#39; tragedy, Cacoyannis revisits all of these themes in a modern, clear, and dramatic fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The relationships governing the political machinations are clearly demonstrated: war corrupts and destroys the human soul to such an extent that neither the individual nor the group can function normally any longer. With the possible exception of Menelaus, whose honor has been tarnished by his own wife&#39;s elopement with her lover, everyone else has his own private motivation for going to war with Troy, which has nothing to do with Helen: the thirst for power (Agamemnon), greed (the army, Odysseus), or glory (Achilles). And so in a real sense, Helen became the WMD of the Trojan War. The war, stripped of all Homeric glamor and religious sanctioning, was just an imperialist venture, spurred primarily by the desire for material gain, all else being a convenient pretext.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another conflict raised in the film is that between the Church and the State. Calchas, who represents the Church, feeling the challenge to his priestly authority and wishing to destroy Agamemnon for the insult to the Goddess he serves, tells him to sacrifice his daughter. In consenting to the sacrifice, the King comes closer to his moral undoing, but in refusing, loses his power over the masses (his army), who are brainwashed by religion. Of course, for Agamemnon, it&#39;s a game. The King must go along with the charade whether he honestly believes in the Gods or not, until he realizes, too late, that he has ensnared himself into committing a despicable filicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a sacrifice or a murder, and how can we tell the difference between the two? By focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrifice--and, worst of all, the sacrifice of one&#39;s own child--Euripides/Cacoyannis creates a drama that is at once deeply political and agonizingly personal. It touches on a most complex and delicate ethical problem facing any society: the dire conflict between the needs of the individual versus those of the society. In the case of Iphigenia, however, as in the Biblical tale of Abraham and Isaac, the father is asked to kill his own child, by his own hand. What sort of God would insist on such payment? Can it be just or moral, even if divinely inspired? Finally, does the daughter&#39;s sacrificial death differ from the deaths of all the sons and daughters who are being sent to war? These are many deep questions raised by a two-hour film.

First of all, let me say this film isn&#39;t for everyone. It has a very strange subject matter. A spinster living alone and living a boring life discovers a young man in a park just across the street from her townhouse. She notices him sitting out in the rain and invites him in to dry off &amp; warm up. The man does not speak and the woman assumes he is deaf mute. Still, she is fascinated with him and sexually interested in him. He finds her odd and continues his silence although we find out later that he isn&#39;t mute at all and that he reports to his sister everything that is going on between him &amp; the woman. I won&#39;t give away the rest of the plot. If you can find this film watch it. You cannot take your eyes off of it. What makes it so interesting? Well, it is totally unique. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it and watching these two together is very uncomfortable. Especially when you find out what this bland, boring, obsessive spinster is capable of. You won&#39;t forget it soon.

The highlight of this movie for me was without doubt Tom Hanks. As Mike Sullivan, he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional (for him) role. Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you like, admire and root for. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It&#39;s true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble - his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son. Even so, he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings. So Hanks took a role I wouldn&#39;t have expected him in, and he pulled it off well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanks&#39; good performance aside, though, I certainly couldn&#39;t call this an enjoyable movie. After an opening that I would best describe as enigmatic (it wasn&#39;t entirely clear to me for a while where this was going) it turns into a very sombre movie, about the complicated relationships Sullivan has developed as a gangster - largely raised by Rooney (Paul Newman), who&#39;s a sort of mob boss, and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them &#34;clean&#34; so to speak; isolated from his business. After the older son witnesses a murder, the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet, gets the wrong son (and the mother), and leaves Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. It becomes a weird sort of father/son bonding movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it ends on a somewhat hopeful note (at least in the overall context of the story) it&#39;s really very dark throughout, that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall. I have to confess that while I appreciated Hanks&#39; performance, the movie as a whole just didn&#39;t pull me in. 4/10

I thought this was a very good movie. It would have been nice to have seen a little more into the movie about the 2 sisters knowing about each liking the same boy before he was killed off. I&#39;m sure if the movie had been done this way there would have been a very different ending, that&#39;s why this made this move such a good movie. It shows that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings that you can always get thru it and that if it&#39;s 2 sisters dealing with a boy, (the same boy) that working thru the pain and hurt makes things to seem better and easier to work out between the 2 of them. It&#39;s nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone&#39;s life that you can still get thru it become even closer after its over. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I still do now when it comes on. I seem to find myself watching it every time it comes on. It would have been nice if there would have been a part 2 for this movie, maybe having the older sister to come up and have his baby, this would really have made a great finish to the story since he died, this way it would keep him alive even though he&#39;s dead.

Great adaptation of the Christie novel. Surprising attention to authentic period details for the time (Many films of the mid-1970s-early 80s that try to do 1920s-early 30s look far too mid-70s-early 80s for my liking, so expected the worst here, and was gladly proved wrong)The costumes and sets are very well done. I liked this production very much  largely due to the adorable Francesca Annis&#39; portrayal of a carefree bright young Lady &#34;Frankie&#34; and James Warwick&#39;s charming Bobbie. The pair would go on to portray Christie&#39;s Tommy &amp; Tuppence, which is funny as some contemporary book critics compared Frankie and Bobby to her earlier characters of Tommy &amp; Tuppence. The supporting characters were equally well done  the over the top Mrs. Rivington (acted by Miss Marple-to-be Joan H.) and &#34;Badger&#34; is played perfectly as the post WWI, &#34;Bertie Wooster type.&#34;

Well, of course the critics hated it. This isn&#39;t a movie that&#39;s going for the big-time critical acclaim. But the fact is that it&#39;s really very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, if you don&#39;t like that Chris Farley brand of physical comedy, or the exceedingly dry wit of David Spade, you&#39;re not going to like it. But for the rest of us, the movie has many hilarious, and for that matter quotable, sequences, and the plot isn&#39;t half as dumb as that of &#34;Black Sheep.&#34; The parts that aren&#39;t meant to be humorous are actually done well, not what you&#39;d expect from a movie of this ilk, and the acting is really pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Tommy Boy&#34; is without question Chris Farley&#39;s best movie. I give it an A and suggest you give it a view.

First I have to say that I really love Udo Kier and have always had respect for Armand Assante but nothing could save this train wreck of a movie. Udo does not even appear till much later in the movie and the acting from Everyone is just terrible. The script is all over the place, the dialog is wooden, the &#34;action&#34; is laughable and the plot could be summed up on a dirty cocktail napkin. I really wanted to find something redeeming in this movie but found myself holding my hands over my eyes, shaking my head and repeating over and over to myself, &#34;Oh Udo.....why???....Why?????..&#34;. If you are a fan of Udo or Armand, please don&#39;t watch this movie. It will only make you sad for them.

First off, let&#39;s start with the negative points: 1) There are HUGE, gaping wholes in the story line and questions that are raised that will get no where near being answered; 2) The movie is not for all people, so impolite viewers will get restless and start yapping during the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point two above is important because the movie is very quiet. In an older type theater (like the one I went to), you can hear the reel going through the projector at times. I loved that. The movie does not keep you busy with music, nor effects: it lets you reflect upon what is happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lack of rhythm that generates an atmosphere that is fascinating an utterly enjoyable. The same kind of atmosphere generated by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it to fans of cinema, as the cinematographic work is amazing. Those that base their appreciation of a movie solely on the story will be utterly disappointed. It&#39;s the kind of story that you have to make up the links in your mind afterwards. (My version of it is pretty darn cool, but probably quite off-track!) If you do go catch the movie, there is one very cool part: when the two cops are talking to each other on their cell phones. An ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. Hats off to the person that thought of doing this.

A great film in its genre, the direction, acting, most especially the casting of the film makes it even more powerful. A must see.

The premise for Circle of Two is an intriguing one. A forbidden love between a sixty year old painter Ashleigh (Richard Burton) and a fifteen year old girl Sarah Norton (Tatum O&#39;Neill); and the question of whether such a relationship is acceptable given society&#39;s standards. The problem with Circle of Two, however, is that it fails to live up to its promise. Director Jules Dassin and Hedley should have put more thought into the screenplay. When I watched this film, I expected to learn something new about love and sexuality. Instead, I got boring dialogue, a pointless lecture on art, outings where Sarah seemed to have more fun away from Ashleigh, and a closing scene so artificial that its emotional impact was lost. This script makes good actors look bad. So one can imagine how the film&#39;s problems were compounded even further with the largely amateurish cast that Jules Dassin assembled. Tatum O&#39;Neill was not in her element. I did not believe for a second that her character Sarah was in love with Ashleigh. Her performance seemed superficial, like a contestant at a beauty pageant. It was as though she forced herself to be happy, when the script required her to be happy, and to be sad, when the script asked her to be sad. The only scene I liked with her in was at the very end when she said nothing at all. That was probably the closest Tatum&#39;s Sarah Norton ever came to being real. But Tatum was not the only one at fault. Richard Burton&#39;s Ashleigh lacked the charm, the charisma and the complexity to attract even women of his own age, let alone a fifteen year old. The rest of the cast was also dismal. Even their arguing was unconvincing, because they waited to take turns. Who does that? Michael Wincott as the jealous ex-boyfriend Paul was probably the best thing in this film, but his role was small. To be fair to the actors, Dassin&#39;s direction let everyone down; but it is also true that a great movie goes beyond the script. Kubrick&#39;s Lolita did that with James Mason and Sue Lyon; Konchalovsky&#39;s Runaway Train went beyond the script with Jon Voight and Eric Roberts playing convicts. The directors of these films also knew how to use music to dramatize their films and reveal something about the characters in them. In spite of its own score (a combination of Antonio Vivaldi, Carl Off and Bernard Hoffer), Circle of Two never succeeds in doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the idea of a forbidden love story between an elder painter and a teenage girl is a good one, but its execution in Circle of Two is terrible. In many ways, it is a shame that a controversial, Lolita-type story  which most film directors for understandable reasons would prefer to avoid  did not have receive more intelligent treatment; that a script which actors would have gladly rehearsed was not written; that actors, who were committed to their part or had the talent to make their characters real, could not be found; and that the director Jules Dassin (who did so much better with films like Rififi and Topkapi) did not have to will to put his foot down and say, &#34;Before we do any filming, we must rethink the love story and revamp the script.&#34; The only silver lining is that one day an intelligent film about an elder painter and a teenager girl falling in love may one day be made. If such a film ever appears, this it will be surely spark controversy, debate and questions for many years to come.

Isn&#39;t it depressing how the most violent cartoon on Cartoon Network is aimed at girls? While I&#39;m not watching soldiers getting shot and blown up on Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, it would be nice if there was a cartoon or at least something on TV I could watch to satisfy my violent urges. And something that I would not get made fun of for watching. I did see some episodes (I should really be shot for this) and had to sit through the movie (now, where do I find a gun?), and it is quite clear that this lost its spark after the first few episodes. If you like seeing 500-foot monsters that can destroy huge cities in seconds getting slaughtered by toddlers about one foot tall, this is a must-see. But it does get very boring after a while, and with a show like this, even original ideas become chiefly dull. The movie just felt like one overlong episode (I can&#39;t remember any of it), and the villain should have been far more intimidating than a green monkey. This show is a laughing stock. It churns out the same basic premise episode after episode after episode, and though it may try to have some mystery and intrigue once in a while, the ending will always be the same - &#34;The Powerpuff Girls save the day!&#34; All is good and nice, but all is very, very repetitive... I give it 3 out of 10 for being the only danged cartoon on CN to revolve around violence, although it is aimed at girls, so I won&#39;t be tuning in for it ever. I&#39;ve established myself as a fan of war and violence films and I won&#39;t have that reputation destroyed... 3/10

Pot-seeking pre-teen Joshua Miller (as Tim) throws his sister&#39;s doll into the river while Daniel Roebuck (as Samson) howls and smokes a cigarette, after killing Danyi Deats (as Jamie). The doll washes away, but the naked young woman stays by the &#34;River&#39;s Edge&#34;, for any passerby to see. Viewing the dead body are a group of twenty-something teenagers, mostly classmates of the naked corpse. Stoners Keanu Reeves (as Matt) and Crispin Glover (as Layne) are found most camera-worthy. The friends wonder what to do about their guilty, beer-guzzling killer friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veteran-in-the-cast Dennis Hopper (as Feck) keeps the youngsters&#39; heads fed. Mr. Hopper once killed a woman. He lives with one of those life-sized sex dolls, with a mouth apparently ready for action. Ione Skye Leitch (as Clarissa) is a more living doll, and she is waiting for Reeves to kiss her. Their copulation is notably cross-cut with a flashback to the opening strangulation. An actual teenager, in her first feature role, Ms. Leitch is the daughter of sixties-singer Donovan. Make other quirky connections on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read a lot into the movie, or not, depending on your mood. Some of the characters&#39; backgrounds may be a little too subtle. Most obviously, the killer teen was teased; note his weight, attitude, and &#34;toilet&#34;-connected nickname. Some of the characters&#39; relationships and motivations are too vaguely defined, but the cast certainly keeps the material interesting; and, director Tim Hunter, photographer Frederick Elmes, and writer Neal Jimenez are obviously skilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******* River&#39;s Edge (8/27/86) Tim Hunter ~ Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover, Dennis Hopper, Joshua Miller

some would argue this is better mainly because of the acting; but it is indeed far worse for reasons that outweigh the improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the source from which all the problems stem; the story. aside from one of them people being shot point blank, with a shotgun, in the chest and surviving for hours without medical attention, there is a bigger problem. Nic, the gangsta with the golden heart is willing to do anything for the friend he just met that day; and that includes asking an evil spirit for help. Ce-Ce, who comes out of nowhere with a past in voodoo, is willing to summon Killjoy, so long as Nic can &#34;hook her up.&#34; the acting, while improved, is still horrid. these people couldn&#39;t convey emotion out of a paper bag. the script doesn&#39;t help them either. stupid lines, and i can only assume no direction from the director. this script was read like Shakespeare in high school with a teacher whipping them as they went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;while this movie (if you can call it that at its 80 min. run time (thankfully)) is perhaps even funnier than the first because of all these things, it is definitely more painful to watch. 1/10.

I&#39;ve bought, &#34; The Feast of All Saints,&#34; and it&#39;s not truly a horrible movie, but a lot of things could have been better. It had a lot of historical value, played out by very talented actress/actors, and it&#39;s not an everyday occurrence that actors can play out such a role and have it be somewhat believable. There were some parts that were a little mediocre and confusing, but I wouldn&#39;t say that the entire movie was horrible. Once you think about that, capturing 1800&#39;s New Orleans, and making something out of it, it pretty hard, and much harder to get actors who can strongly signify those parts. But the only big problem I had with the movie was that most of the actors who did play the free people of color, were mostly light skinned Africans, not very universal in casting others who weren&#39;t light skinned; one of the old Creole stereotypes that still exists. Whomever did the casting could have picked a wider variety when it came to hue, despite many Creoles are color conscious.Rather picking actors that looked near white in a sense, could have been more thought out.The actors did a great job, the script could have better written, and overall I found the performances were very believable.

I was probably one of the few Australians not watching the tennis when this series aired. I have to say when William McInnes first appeared I though, that is one crappy actor! But as the series continued he toned down his performance and I totally loved him. He was such a rotten guy but he did make me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting to see Speers play a nice, quiet man and even more interesting to watch Tom Longs&#39; rippling muscles! Sigh... Seriously, Long&#39;s performance was a total shock and really brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was good also in a small role, and the leading actress put in an entertaining performance. I&#39;d recommend this programme if you enjoy stories with a twist and watching Tom Long walk around with no shirt on...

A multi-millionaire marries a female doctor. He hasn&#39;t worked in a day and she is devoted to her profession. He sees her off each day. Something has got to give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our hero, Henry Fonda, finally decides to do something with his life. He becomes a salesman in a department store but is soon fired as poorer people need the job. In the meantime, Dr. Helen Hunt, (Barbara Stanwyck) has given up her practice? What&#39;s there to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirk (Fonda) buys a bankrupt hospital and the two shall now be happy aiding others while they eke out an existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s with the writing here? When annoyed with her husband, Dr. Hunt says, &#34;You&#39;ve been acting like gestapo.&#34; This is supposed to be a comedy. Hogwash. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very boring, tedious film. Very little going on here.

&#34;Landscape after a battle&#34; opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather funny movements accompanied by Vivaldis Four Seasons. A touching opening. But we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob, and when they (also treated humouristic) burry a man alive, the protagonist stops for a moment, but is soon more engaged in finding books from the turndowned camp than caring about his neighbour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the film is set in an American camp from where the prisoners are not released, in some kind of semi freedom, semi camp. A perfect set for a study of war criminality, American camps, Polish nationalism, Catholisism, grief and human misery in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Film makes an important turn. In comes women, and with them film changes light, colour and temper. At the same time it turns out that these prisoners were slaves in Holocaust. I think a main underlying political theme of the film must mankind&#39;s treatments of Jews under and after the world war, and not only the Nazi exterminations, but mankind letting it happen - and even forcing them out of Europe after the war. On an emotional level the film is about grief and the problem with letting grief come, how environment makes grief difficult, and how difficult it can be to share grief for people with different experiences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the film is a carpet of underlying contradictions,humour, irony and sudden beauty. A couple of times during the film a gypsy prisoner plays on an harp, an emotional tune brutally rejected (filmatically speaking) by the protagonist. That example picks up an important essence of the film&#39;s style and theme. When it comes to humour its very comic how the protagonist constantly looses and finds back his glasses, in crowds, in hay stacks etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not hard to understand Spielberg&#39;s respect of Wajda when you see this film. The great treatment of light can be compared with Spielberg on his best. The Grunwald intermezzo speaks for itself. Narrativly it only brings the film out of the camp, but filmatically it brings the film to dream and eternity with profound beauty. Anyhow, there is also another scene I can&#39;t let go without comment. Its the Christian Supper. Undoubtly ironical, but simultaneously deeply religious we see the transsubstantiation moment, everybody falling on their knees, while the protagonist is saved from isolation by the priest to serve as a comic altar boy. His bells are mocking the scene, but also gives it emotion and love. When Nina gets her bread, sun light falls upon her and bells ring spheric, its the peak moment of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main actors are excellent in their roles. Olbrychski as the perfect Wajda protagonist - the doubting reflecting mind, unable to put all the aspects of his mind and emotion into life. Beautiful Celinska is with great body acting debuting in a character unable to express all her inner in her proud movements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who try to describe everything, often are unable to take nothing in consideration. This is what Wajda manages. His films are either very moving, deep or beautifully shot, but pays attention to life&#39;s and society&#39;s particularity. A moment of joy for one, is the moment of irony for a second, the moment of grief for the third, a moment of nothing for the fourth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is at least two reasons to pay attention to Wajdas films of this period. First is the remarkable free expression of deep political impact. This country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. Second is the development of a filmatic and narrative language that Kusturica has rose to grandeur.

Who ever put that review as &#39;of bad taste&#39; is not all quite there... its so funny, genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series...all is as good as Morris&#39; standards. if you think that it is &#39;awful&#39;, &#39;distasteful&#39; or &#39;sick&#39; then i can only think of one thing to say to you: &#34;go to hell.&#34; thanks. it had to be said! i think that the way that so many people complaining was a complete joke...i would like to make a shout out to all the people that actually did that: &#34;haven&#39;t you got anything better to do with your time? what are you trying to prove?&#34; thanks for reading my heart-filled review on the matter...cheers

I only saw the first part of this and concluded that I wouldn&#39;t miss anything if I didn&#39;t watch the second episode. The cinematography was OK, but apart from this, the plot was just as commonorgarden and run-of-the-mill as any other war story. The actors and actresses play their characters without any passion, and the make up is really bad (Heiner Lauterbach with his white hair and Kai Wiesinger respectively, as if some dyed white hair could give them more dignity and common sense). I mean if you&#39;ve watched more than two or three movies about WWII (as most of us have) then you&#39;d only go to the trouble of seeing a third or fourth one if it promises some new insights or twists in the plot. But Roland Suso Richter seems to afraid of doing so, you can almost smell his fear of not living up to the bourgeois and jejune expectations of the conservative ZDF TV channel while watching this movie. Millions of Euros were spent to perpetuate boring and unimaginative German film-making. These millions of dollars could have been spent to make three or four independent movies, but no, let&#39;s give to some director who&#39;ll make a film that tells people that war can be explained by rational means. My advice: Read Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut instead. They&#39;ll tell you what war is like! Or give me one million Euros and I make a better film than this load of BS! And another thing: Why is it that German movies only get to be nominated for the Oscars when the movie deals with WWII or the Holocaust? Probably because that is the only thing German film-making is good at. And that should get us thinking, shouldn&#39;t it?

This movie completely ran laps around the original Dolemite. It had everything that makes a movie great..except for real actors. (Ernie Hudson couldn&#39;t do it alone and you KNOW that! LOL) I admit that I have killed my first video tape of this movie and I plan to buy the DVD version again as soon as possible! This movie has so many catchy lines it&#39;s pitiful! I am embarrassed to say that I know the theme song backwards and forwards! I love Jimmy Lynch&#39;s character to death, and he should have won the Best Supporting Actor Award in Blaxploitation, but the Oscars were NEVER ready for this! This is a random film consisting of Crooked Cops, Breasts, Chases, Bad Editing, and of course martial arts. (Being that it&#39;s the 70&#39;s and I can say everyone knew some kind of martial arts). I think this movie should be restored and shown one night in the midst of a marathon in local theaters!

Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. The animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie; mostly at the concept. After that, the joke wore thin. As a 15-20 minute animated short, Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead, this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weathers, voiced by Ludicrous, does have several crude and funny one-liners. Unfortunately, that is all the boy&#39;s pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story. Eventually, I grew as bored with his remarks as I did the rest of this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of South Park, and other animation aimed at adults. I also play several online pimp games, so I am partial to stories about pimps. The transition from little boy to lil pimp was brilliant; but after that, both the story and dialog became redundant and predictable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this movie a five. It is worth watching for the great concept and voice acting. Just do not expect much else or you will be quite disappointed.

Yeah this films is tops. Cant recommend it more. Gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never dull. Great access. A film made with passion and interest in the subject matter. Some of the performances and just amazing. If you only find this film on VHS it is still very worth watching. Great. 10 out of 10. I got to see part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what I was watching. The interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who are like heavy- weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto. The filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement. Cool. Track it down.

I really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. It&#39;s basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but it fails miserably. It consistently feels like it was written and acted by high-school kids for some school project, and that&#39;s also the level the humor seems to be aimed at. There is no subtlety and, more damningly for a mockumentary, it never once feels like a documentary. And while the lines aren&#39;t funny in the first place, an attempt at dead-pan delivery would have helped -- certainly, anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d recommend this to people who like &#34;comedies&#34; in the vein of &#34;Big Momma&#39;s House&#34; or &#34;Norbit&#34;; people who think that words like &#34;butt&#34; are inherently hysterically funny. Other people should stay away and not waste their time.

This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans chaired by a no-nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth. But the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market place and the political system demands that he conform, rendering him no different than his predecessors. Interesting, off-beat movie.

Huge, waddling, grimacing tree trunk menaces fake &#34;natives&#34; on a &#34;Pacific Atoll&#34; (looking suspiciously like Southern CA...), reaking havok and revenge. Unlike the silly stumps in &#34;Navy VS The Night Monsters&#34;, the Tabonga is actually a full-grown man-tree. Well, grown in 2 days: moost have od&#39;ed on those Miracle Grow spikes...Anycow, it comes not from Hell, but from the grave of a fake native, Kimo(Greg Palmer, &#34;The Zombies of Mora Tau&#34;), murdered by the native elders for hanging out with those awful American scientists. The scientists include Dr. William Arnold (Tod Andrews, &#34;Hang &#39;em High&#34;, &#34;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&#34;) and Professor Clark(John McNamara,&#34;War of the Colossal Beast&#34;). Rounding out the cast is Linda Watkins(&#34;The Parent Trap&#34;) as the obnoxious Mrs. Kilgore, the obvious comic relief spurting out an obvious fake &#34;cockney&#34; accent. A stellar cast indeed!! Anycow, because his doughy, vacant wife, Korey, played amateurishly by Suzanne Ridgeway(&#34;Love&#39;s A-Poppin&#39;&#34;), helps set him up, Kimo declares his revenge on her and all of the elders. Then, the dopey American scientists uproot the tree, bring it back to life &#34;in the name of science&#34;, &amp; allows it to SLOWLY amble about the island, killing off everyone who has done him wrong. Of course, we all know that evil monsters carry off fair maidens, so the Tabonga grabs plucky female scientist Dr. Terry Mason(Tina Carver, &#34;Hell on Frisco Bay&#34;) &amp; waddles off with her. Vine-ally, a good shot with a Remmington hits a knife lodged in the Tabonga, and it falls over dead into the quicksand. This laughably foolish cowncept is one of the all-time cheesy howlers. The Tabonga is arguably the slowest monster in moovie history, right up there with the clanky, over-built robot from &#34;Robot Monster vs the Aztec Mummy&#34; and the perversly slow carpet monster from &#34;Creeping Terror&#34;. Try not to laugh as you watch the Tabonga toss fake natives down hills &amp; into quicksand, dodge spears, and lumber slowly about the &#34;island&#34;. Shady writing, wooden performances, and sappy direction all point that this pulpy fertilizer has far mooore bark than bite. This tepid pile of wood chips was the last hurrah from long-time editor-turned-director Dan Milner, who quickly vanished into well-deserved obscurity following this film. You herd it through the grapevine from the MooCow first: &#34;From Hell it Came&#34; is a compost classic!! :

This is possibly the worst of the cockney gangster genre that has blighted the British film industry since Mockney Guy Ritchie unleashed Lock stock and two badly acted barrels. This &#34;True Life&#34; story of Carlton Leach (who?) has everything that is wrong with this genre, a truly awful script that consists of people screeching &#34;Cant&#34;, &#34;Fahcking Cant&#34; and &#34;I&#39;ll kill ya, ya fahcking cant&#34; ad nauseum. The acting is uniformly dreadful with the two most recognisable cast members being two former soap stars quite visably out of their depth. For some reason the film assumes we have heard of these people and i can assure you anybody north of Essex hasn&#39;t, and that we should be interested in some low lifes story. Why? This isn&#39;t Goodfellas despite the blurb on the DVD cover. The story centres around a football hooligan turned bouncer turned gangster who&#39;s friends end up getting shot. Boo hoo. The fact that these people are totally unsympathetic is the only minor plus for this film. In all of the action scenes it seems that the camera was tied to a piece of string and whirled around while people pretended to fight and the story of somebody most people have never heard of and nothing really interesting happens too is a complete waste of time. People talk about how violent the film is as though it&#39;s the sign of a great film and, although many great films have violence in them, this is just an excuse for the FX man to show what he can do. Overall this film is a reminder of why the British film industry is defunct and the sooner we stop funding these pathetic abortions the better.

There is nothing wrong with showing an old man falling in love with a young girl. Lolita did it. American Beauty did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But. They did it subtly. They did not make it so apparent from the start that the director is gearing them up to make them fall in love with each other. Not as naturally as two people would (Age no bar) but forcing them to be around each other as if they were SUPPOSED to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, there should have been chemistry. It would have solved the biggest problem. People with reservations against the subject would also have been engrossed and perhaps convinced. It would have become the perfect love story, no matter the impracticality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it difficult to believe Jia&#39;s character at times. What I found more difficult to understand, is why Vijay - a photographer and an artist, who seems serious - would have had an interest in a girl so frivolous. Unless he himself has some frivolousness hidden in himself, which did not come out at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of use of Dutch angles or angles in which the frame is tilted. It is generally used to show something unnatural or something that might lead to something that is not right. So RGV is himself calling the relationship unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The camera angles, background score, editing, and even the juxtaposition of shots and symbology emphasises and overemphasises their relationship. Is the Indian audience so dumb that we need to be told something in 10 different ways for us to understand? Especially when the two of them were dancing together... it was apparent what was happening. What was the need of slowing the scene down with dramatic background music? I feel the subject was very well chosen. But Verma should not have made the film with the fact in mind constantly that this is a controversial subject. If it is, then handle it delicately, why don&#39;t you?

I was the Production Accountant on this movie, and I also got to do some voice-over work on it, so I&#39;m not entirely unbiased, but if it were awful, I would say so. I thought it was a fun film, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, by any means, but there were plenty of laughs along the way. The Bible states that laughter does good like a medicine, so watching this movie could be good for your health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many of the actors in this picture hadn&#39;t yet reached their peak at the time we made this film. Susan Sarandon, of course, is one who has since gone on to much greater fame. Melanie Mayron was seen on TV on a weekly basis as a photographer in the &#34;Thirty-Something&#34; TV drama series. Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, still haunting people&#39;s dreams. One of my personal favorite actors on this show was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comedic actor, and a truly nice, sincere person. We all had fun working on this show, and I think that fun comes through.

White man + progress + industrialization = BAD. First nations + nature + animals = GOOD. Simple formula. Actually, in past days the same kind of propaganda was used to defend the status quo; now it is used to attack it. However, that being said, I think the movie does succeed in overcoming hackneyed politicization because it plays to the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone. You may not be onside with the movie&#39;s rubbishy revisionism of how the West was won, er lost. But anyone can feel a sense of longing for the days when horses could run free on the Western plains. (The movie also conveniently sidesteps the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there). Anyway, I liked it. The quality of the animation - especially the opening shot - is incredible.

I have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in Russia. In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - &#34;50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk&#34;, but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could, so I declined to take this speaking part on. I was slightly starstruck as this was my first Film experience....and who knows... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as &#34;I&#39;ll be Back&#34; and &#34;Quite Frankly My Dear, I Don&#39;t Give a Damn&#34;. Had I spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as &#39;Heavy 1&#39; instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As time goes on, I am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I spent a whole day on the set, in South Wales hot-spot Barry Island, no one could tell me what the actual storyline was. The caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been worse if I&#39;d ended up naked in this most dreadful of films....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still.....On the positive side....I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was, as &#34;Notting Hill&#34; was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be Welsh. Made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed up that I realised I was in a quality production........

The film is a remake of a 1956 BBC serial called&#39;My Friend Charles&#39;,&amp; as such gallops thru the material in a relatively short time.I found it fast moving,enjoyable &amp; unpretentious.Did anyone else notice the scenes,towards the end,where John Mills was being gassed?-the producers obviously decided to omit the scenes-maybe censorship?,but notice when he&#39;s sat by the window of the flat,deep breathing closely followed by similar scenes with the car window open. The Francis Durbridge serials all seemed to inhabit the same universe,that of unexplained happenings,people being not what they seem &amp; the villain being someone close to the hero/victim.A predictable universe in some ways,but one with its own rules &amp; regulations.

I&#39;ve seen about a half dozen of the low budget poverty row B westerns that Ken Maynard made in the 1930s, and I am consistently amazed at how poor an actor he was. How did he ever get to be a leading cowboy actor? They say that he could ride pretty well back in the silents, but he doesn&#39;t do anything particularly impressive in these later sound films. Still, maybe he got the leads because he was big and could ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phantom Rancher isn&#39;t as bad as some of the other Ken Maynard films I&#39;ve seen, but it still isn&#39;t much. Some of the other characters refer to him a couple of times as a &#34;young fella,&#34; where it appears to me that he&#39;s just as old as the other older actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if that&#39;s not silly enough, there&#39;s a rather significant script problem in this film. At one point, one of the characters makes a remark about how the phantom had prevented the poisoning of a well, something that hadn&#39;t happened yet. Just a couple of minutes later, we then see that particular scene. No, it wasn&#39;t a flashback. At first I thought perhaps that when Treeline Films was doing the DVD transfer, they might have reversed two of the reels. But in those days film reels contained approximately 11 minutes of film, and the whole reversal only took about 3 or 4 minutes tops. Everything else was in a logical order. So, it looks like that was a genuine continuity problem in the original film. Maybe that&#39;s one reason why Colony Pictures didn&#39;t last very long.

In a recent biography of Alec Guinness I couldn&#39;t find too much about To Paris With Love. I&#39;m sure Guinness did the film to get a free trip to Paris out of it. The film has no other reason for existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris of course is nicely photographed with that wonderful opening of Guinness and his son driving down the Champs Elysee with the Arc De Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately it goes downhill from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is just no chemistry at all between Guinness and the young girl who he has a brief fling with in Paris. According to the recent biography of Guinness by Piers Paul Read, Guinness positively disliked the girl, found her conduct unprofessional. As to what Odile Vernois thought of her co-star, no record is available. They have as much chemistry as two neutered cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guinness does have a good moment in the film which was straight from one of his Ealing comedies as he climbs a tree trying to retrieve a badminton shuttlecock. But I wouldn&#39;t wait through the film for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least Alec got a trip to Paris out of the deal.

This film is an entertaining, fun and quality film. The film very cleverly follows the guidelines if the book, and tries to stick to the exact lines. The actors are all suitable, and you would expect them to be the part. They use some famous actors which give a great effect on the film. The graphics is a bit dodgy in some parts, and there are quite a few mistakes throughout the film. There is no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard, for example. The camp is not as gruesome as explained in the book, and they tend not to show the goings on in the camp as much as the book. All of his group are mentioned a lot in the book, but are not in the film. Overall, a great film for a rainy afternoon

For the most part, romance films were never my cup of tea. But Valley Girl is one of the few romance films I not only could sit through, but actually enjoy. Nicholas Cage is great in his first role and Deborah Foreman is cute beyond belief. There are some side stories that tend to become muddled, but not enough to diminish this film.

Although I have rarely flown myself, I am keenly interested in aviation... and this film has added to the precious laughing stock in aviation cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Why is the captain doing the ground checks? Why does he even measure the oil levels in the engines? With turnaround times as low as 15 minutes in commercial aviation this is not a typical pre-flight check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. WHY does the captain KICK against the aircraft tire? Strange kind of pressure check. Or anger management :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The cockpit has a crew of 3. All large, western, two-engined jets built since the 1980ies have a crew of 2 people. Now try a guess at how old the movie script is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. A helicopter manages to fly alongside the crippled airliner. Must be a fast one... and the captain&#39;s words to explain the &#34;maneuver&#34; to the passengers are indeed hilarious ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. With arrested elevator rudders it is always possible to lower the nose of the aircraft. It happens, for example, when any aircraft moves slower than the stall speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The elevator rudders have hydraulic actuators. After the collision with the business plane it would, most probably, have severed the hydraulic lines and thus make them useless for steering, but it would NOT fix them in certain position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The fire in the aft galley was a stupid idea. It was designed to show that only gentlemen ask for the extinguisher and fight the fire, regardless of who was actually trained to do that  the flight attendant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. At the time of collision, the aircraft&#39;s elevators would have been in a neutral position. The film could have ended here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. The flight engineer (the third person in the cockpit) has three bars on his uniform. In reality, flight engineers have two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Why does the captain slash the cabin casing with an axe to examine the damage behind? I thought it would have been the flight engineer&#39;s duty, as he is already supposed to perform technical checks before and after flight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. In any aircraft, there is no unused space. At least commercial airplanes cannot afford the luxury of a compartment that can be filled with tons of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on... but at last I laughed hysterically about how the screenwriters imagine aircraft disasters! Woooohooo! Most aircraft disasters happen in such a short time span that you simply cannot make 90-minute flicks out of them. But you can always fill 90 minutes with mind-boggling and insane crap, irrespective of the genre.

Not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While watching &#34;Bang&#34; one night on TV, I found myself bored by the nonsensical, random plot which was occurring on screen. The entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless, artsy-fartsy self-indulgence on the part of the filmmaker. The fact that the director/writer goes by a one name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare I say, more entertaining than this complete waste of time.

This is seriously one of the best low budget, B movies that I have ever seen. I am not one to stand up and cheer during a movie, but this one was definitely worth it. Obviously the premise is that there is a bed that eats people, well...eats is a subjective term I guess, it really secretes acid bubbles to suck the victims into itself and dissolves them in it&#39;s acidy goodness. The best part of this movie is that William Russ is one of the main characters. The typical family man actually started his career with this movie...and an afro. There is plenty of nudity in this flick, so obviously not for the children, but that should not deter anyone from seeing this movie. It is my belief that everyone needs a little Death Bed in their lives at some point or other, it&#39;s best to get it sooner than later.

OK another film bought by me and Joe Swatman. OK this isn&#39;t the worst film i&#39;ve reviewed this week but it still sucked royaly. we had a lot of fun watching this piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Monster Jigsaw is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional students ideas, u just know ur in for trouble when someone equips him with a buzzsaw and a sawed of shotgun, the film wasn&#39;t as gory as we hoped, i mean on of the deaths is a heart attack. Again i think the acting sucks, sum of the actors must be porn stars and one get into her undies for what ever reason. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolute worst part is the ending, it leaves it open for a bit of a Jigsaw 2 but thats never gunna happen lets face it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ratings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;funny 4/100 mock (how much fun we had mocking it) 73/100 acting 8/100 generally 12/100

Other than John Krasinski, this movie was absolutely terrible. The Lacey Chabert and Andrew Keegan love story was as clichéd as possible, full of unbelievably bad lines about how her parents wouldn&#39;t ever let them be together and super-hammy longing looks. None of the &#34;emotion&#34; had any depth or reality whatsoever. The two accented-characters (Dean Edwards as Rupert and whoever it was playing the gun expert)....once they saw how bad the accents were, couldn&#39;t they have decided to just drop them and rewrite a couple of lines to avoid giving the audience headaches? Apparently not. I don&#39;t even know where to start with the editing, particularly the sound editing. If you hate obvious over-dubbing as much as I do, don&#39;t watch this. That being said, Krasinski was great. Off the bat I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m a huge Office fan and that&#39;s why I rented this. But he&#39;s quite entertaining as the &#34;off-the-wall friend with crazy ideas&#34;. He&#39;s got a clichéd role, but he still manages to make it as entertaining as possible. The ending was awful. Just flat out terrible. The idea of the robbery gone awry had potential, but Keegan floundering around after being shot, all the way to his studio to fall ontop of a painting of Chabert (which looks nothing like her) is the most cringe-worthy scene.

Hunk of trash only the Full Moon Studios could make has a group of college kids, staying for free in an old hospital with no one knowing, as a demonic creature with two faces(barely visible the entire film because of incomprehensible lighting)passes through walls killing each member who has a certain sheet of paper with ancient markings. Someone amongst them(it won&#39;t be too hard to prove, but a slight twist is so uninspiringly revealed and limply executed you&#39;ll just scoff)is the mastermind behind who the beast kills and must be revealed before it kills everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, badly acted mess has a &#34;That&#39;s it?!&#34; kind of weak ending that&#39;ll have you exasperated at why you just wasted your time. Tanya Dempsey, who couldn&#39;t act her way through a wet paper sack, has the heroine duties as the newest member of the college rooming bunch named Clark. Oh, and the title refers to the sound the beast makes before it attacks it&#39;s next victim.

Let&#39;s begin with that theme song sung by Christopher Cross. The song is &#34;If you get caught between the moon and New York City.&#34; It&#39;s a great theme and song even after all these years, it never gets tiring. It really is a great song about New York City as well. Anyway, the great Dudley Moore CBE stars as a spoiled drunken millionaire who is engaged to Jill Eikenberry&#39;s character in the film. Jill would later star on LA Law. Anyway, he is served by his wonderful British butler, Sir John Gielgud OM who won an Academy Award for his performance in the film as Best Supporting Actor. Arthur falls in love with Liza Minnelli&#39;s character who is perfect in this film besides her performance in her Oscar winning role in Cabaret. No, Liza doesn&#39;t get to sing. She plays a diner waitress. Anyway I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as the Bach matriarch of the family who decides the family&#39;s fortune. Anyway, she is fabulous and should have gotten an academy award nomination herself for Best Supporting Actress. Barney Martin best known as Jerry&#39;s dad on Seinfeld plays Liza&#39;s dad. He&#39;s great too. The movie was well-written, acted, and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it.

The hysterical Hardware Wars is finally out on DVD. HW has earned its niche among parody classics and is not only a riotous little 20 minute short but a staple in low budget film production classes, which is where a lot of the film&#39;s cult status is derived from and resides. With the DVD, not only do we get a chance to revisit the original parody (4Q2, Cinnamon-Bun Head, Ballistic Toast, et al) that Ernie F. did in 1978, but there is a lot of additional material showcasing the Fosselius wit. Antique Sideshow is a dead-on parody that is very funny but makes a statement about the confluence of ignorance and greed at the same time. The Director&#39;s Commentary is also hysterical, as is the Creature Feature which parodies taking a film out on the talk-show circuit and actually IS based on taking HW out on the talk show circuit, albeit the public access circuit. I&#39;d love to see Ernie, Michael Wiese and crew take on some other, contemporary overblown and overbudgeted targets to parody -- like just about any film that Hollywood churns out at $100 million a pop these days -- not so much the crafty films like Spider Man or Men In Black (actually parodies themselves!) but any number of overblown, overhyped, overwrought and overpriced features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Does anyone know, where I can see or download the &#34;What I like about you&#34; season 4 episodes in the internet? Because I would die to see them and here in Germany there won&#39;t be shown on TV. Please help me. I wanna see the season 4 episodes badly. I already have seen episode 4 and episode 18 on YouTube. But I couldn&#39;t find more episodes of season 4. Is there maybe a website where I can see the episodes? Because I&#39;ve read some comments in forums from Germany and there were people which had already seen the season 4 episodes even though they haven&#39;t been shown at TV in Germany. I am happy about every information I can get. Thanks Kate

NATURAL BORN KILLERS (1994)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinema Cut: R &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director&#39;s Cut: NC-17&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s an unusual Oliver Stone picture, but when I read he was on drugs during the filming, I needed no further explanation. &#39;Natural Born Killers&#39; is a risky, mad, all out film-making that we do not get very often; strange, psychotic, artistic pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Natural Born Killers&#39; is basically the story of how two mass killers were popularised and glorified by the media; there is a great scene where an interviewer questions some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says &#39;Murder is wrong.... but If I was a mass murderer I&#39;d be Mickey and Mallory&#39;. Mickey describes this with a situation of &#39;Frankenstein (the monster) and Dr. Frankenstein&#39; - Dr. Frankenstein is the media who has turned them into these monstrous killers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most Oliver Stone films examine the flaws of the America, the country that the director loves and admires. I guess &#39;Natural Born Killers&#39; is about the effect of mass media, technology and how obsessive as a nation, Americans are (and most of the world) over things such as mass killers and bizarre situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The killers played by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are executed astonishingly by two excellent actors who step into the lives of two interestingly brutal killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing, perhaps in the cruel theory of Social Darwinism (survival of the fittest) - Mickey says in his interview in prison, that other species commit murder, we as humans ravage other species and exploit the environment; the script is interesting, but it is questionable how much this film amounts to, in the sense of making us think about society and human behaviour, rather than the intensity of a 2 hour bloodbath that we have seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison; we see the harsh realities of prison life; the attitudes of the warden etc;overfilling of prisons - maybe Stone is questioning the future, the path that society is leading to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other interesting characters; First, a reporter who runs a show about &#39;America&#39;s Maniacs&#39; and is obsessed with boosting ratings, that he goes to any length to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is police officer Scagnetti, an insane, perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with Mallory - he also has some weird obsession with mass killers, since his mother was killed during the massacre at Waco, Texas by Charles Whitman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography is superb; different colours, shadows, styles create a feeling of disorientation; the green colour most evident of all is green, to resemble the sickness of the killers (in the drugstore when they are looking for rattlesnake antidote).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The camera work is insane; shaky, buzzy, it takes some determination to get use to it and accept it. Highly unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Natural Born Killers&#39; does not glamourise the existence of insane murderers, it questions it and how we as the public may fuel this attribute...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the above review sound quite positive, I did dislike the film. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the script for the film, was not pleased with the altered screenplay and he asked for his name to be removed. I can see why. While mildly interesting at times, Natural Born Killers is a mess of a picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10

The film, a Universal release of a Protelco-MLC production, is a boring retelling of the theory of breaking down the molecular structure of an object, capturing it in a cell as &#34;pure energy,&#34; and then sending it back complete to a &#34;target area.&#34; There is no explanation WHY this is necessary, but Professor Paul Steiner (played by pock-mocked actor Bryant Haliday, &#34;Devil Doll&#34;) thinks it&#39;s something to dedicate his, and his assistants&#39;, Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen), lives to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During an experiment before noted Dutch scientist &#34;Lembach&#34; (Gordon Heinz), his machine fails due to sabotage, so he has himself &#34;projected&#34; by his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp) to seek revenge. Of course, she screws up and he comes out looking like a &#34;pork roast&#34; with the power to electrocute people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this new-found power, he manages to zap some Cockney idiots, a security guy named Latham (Derrick de Marney) and his lab boss, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He also is able to break into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat, as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, though, despite Hill and Mitchell&#39;s attempt to help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. On the whole, a completely pointless movie with no message at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also one of the most depressing color films you will ever see.

&#34;Balance of Terror&#34; is still one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made. It was inspired by the film &#34;Enemy Below&#34; (starring Robert Mitchum), a movie that deals with a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during World War II. In this episode, Captain Kirk and his crew play similar game with a Romulan vessel. This is the program that famously introduces the war-hungry Romulans, who are distant relatives of the Vulcans. It is an incredibly suspenseful episode, tightly constructed for maximum effect. It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story. Mark Lenard makes his Star Trek debut as the Romulan Captain (he will later play Spock&#39;s father Ambassador Sarek). A must-see episode!

Bette Davis brings her full trunk of tics to this miserable flop which is another variation on the &#34;hilariously mismatched&#34; lovers theme. Sadly, Cagney and Davis are truly mismatched in acting styles and the mix is not simply unpalatable but distasteful. The only distinction in the film comes from Eugene Pallette who, literally, phones in his usual part as the deb&#39;s misunderstood dad. Jack Carson&#39;s performance can only be described as an act of mayhem on the audience

Worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is unbeliaveble but you have to see it really!!!! P.s watch the carrot

is not a bad movie but the acting and the screenplay can be better. I like this movie because i have a life that is in good part like the one in the movie. is hard for a lost generation to get a life in Romania, and 90 percent of us choose something else, and that something else includes dealing with people with &#34;bad habits&#34; if you understand me but that comes with the territory. this movie represent me and i like it. i have a rage in me that i barley talk with people, i live in a messed up society and i can&#39;t fit in and i don&#39;t want to,and that&#39;s the story of movie also, if you r like me you can understand the true movie, if not you will find it easy and cheap.

One reasons why they call the 80&#39;s, &#34;The Awesome 80&#39;s&#34; is quality television. Shows like the Wonder Years, War of the Worlds (the series), V, Amazing Stories, and many more have always left an impression to each &#34;fortunate&#34; one of us that in time will always find a way to reawaken itself. To top that, here comes Monsters! A series quite unique of its own, and a theme fully dedicate to - monsters. May it be the good, the bad, and the morbid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror films then this one is absolutely for you. Provided you can find this rare gem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the newer generations will be in awe with some of the episode with its grittiness, it&#39;s indiscriminating use of gore effects or its story telling power and simplicity. I guarantee, because I&#39;m 23 :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure NOT to miss this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, it&#39;s a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world, it will always be with those who can always remember...

Could someone please explain to me the reason for making this movie? Sad is about all I can say; this movie took absolutely no direction and wound up with me shaking my head. What an awful waste of two hours. Noth should be ashamed of himself for taking money for this piece of garbage.

A ridiculous comedy given an arms-flailing direction. I love one of the comments here: &#34;Couldn&#39;t be made today&#34;. Well, neither could &#34;The Philadelphia Story&#34; without a car chase or two. Nonetheless, does that mean the picture is worse for the wear for being old-fashioned? I don&#39;t think &#34;Susan Slept Here&#34; was good for any generation and it should fester peacefully in the memories of Debbie Reynolds-buffs. There is no sparkle in this story of a screenwriter who latches onto a much-younger girl for &#39;script research&#39;. Dick Powell makes his farewell screen appearance in what must have been an embarrassment to him. Reynolds is pallid. Produced by one Harriet Parsons--who gives her famous mother Louella a number of inane plugs. *1/2 from ****

Having grown up in New Jersey and having spent many a day and night on the gritty streets of New York in the 1970&#39;s, watching a film like &#34;The Seven-Ups&#34;, or its kindred spirit, &#34;The French Connection&#34;, always evokes fond memories of a time and place which, for some, might have been NYC&#39;s darkest hour, but which for me, in my early twenties, was always one fun-filled adventure after another. I truly miss those times. As one reviewer remarked, &#34;This film very aptly captures the stark, cold, matter-of-fact feel of the NYC winter season, while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region&#39;s infamous underworld of crime and policing. A great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture.&#34;. A spot-on characterization of both the film and the city. The stellar attributes of this film -- the plot, the cast, the characters, and of course, the car chase -- are amply described in many of the reviews here, so I won&#39;t go into that except to say that one of my favorite moments occurs during the car chase, when the camera focuses on Richard Lynch riding shotgun to the maniacal Bill Hickman. The look of horror on Richard Lynch&#39;s face, along with the defensive gestures, are so out-of-character for an actor much better known as a source of terror rather than an object of it, that it is actually comical to watch. I get a chuckle out of it every time.

The Merchant of Four Seasons is a film about a lack of love. The film starts off with the main character; Hans Epp, returning from a spell in the foreign legion. He returns to his mother, not to be told how much she loves him, or how much she&#39;s missed him; but to be told that he is worthless and, even worse, that she would have preferred the man he went with to have come back instead. It is the character&#39;s relation to women that makes this film so hateful; the fact that his wife is taller than him is symbolic of his relation to the other gender; he is consistently humiliated by them, and it is through his relations with them that his life isn&#39;t as great as it could have been. This is also shown clearly by the way he treats his wife after a drink. He lost his job as a policeman through lust for a woman, and even his wife; a woman that is supposed to love him, never really shows any affection for him. Even at the end, his wife is more bothered about what her and her daughter will do than the state of her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merchant of Four Seasons is a thoroughly unpleasant film. There isn&#39;t a scene in the movie where someone is happy, and not only that; but the movie seems deliriously blissful to wallow in the misery of it&#39;s central characters. The movie is certainly not recommended to anyone who is currently having a hard time, that&#39;s for sure. Despite all the misery, the film never steps out the bounds of reality; every event in this movie can - and most probably has - happened, and that only serves in making the movie more shocking. The film is, of course, helmed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; the cult German director that committed suicide in 1982. This is only my second taste of the man&#39;s work, but through just two films, it is easy to get an idea of the type of art that he creates. Both films are downtrodden and gritty - yet realistic pieces of art. His characterization in this movie is subtle; we only ever get to know the characters through their plight&#39;s and not through their character. This is a very clever way of showing the audience that it is their surroundings that define the people in the film, not the people themselves - and as nearly everyone that sees the film knows what living in an urban society is like, it wont difficult for the majority of people to relate to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merchant of Four Seasons is not a film that is easily forgettable; the movie is high on substance and low on style, and that makes for a very memorable picture, and one that everyone who considers themselves to be a fan of cinema should experience. It is with that in my mind that I give this film my highest recommendations; it&#39;s not sweet and it&#39;s not pleasant, but you will not see a more realistic portrayal of depression, and this is most certainly a movie that will stay with you.

After seeing the movie, I feel the father and the mother are both reasonable person, although not perfect at all. On the contrary, I don&#39;t like the author, and his two sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a person&#39;s journal an accurate portrait of herself? No. Most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem. So a journal is always a more negative side of a person. In this movie, the author judge his mother&#39;s life by her journal. Not a wise choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author&#39;s elder sister is so ugly, external and internal. First, she said her father&#39;s second marriage is &#34;not fair&#34; for her mother. Then, she said she doesn&#39;t love her mother. So, she don&#39;t love both father and mother. I doubt she love anybody in the world. Her face is so ugly, just a reflection of her heart. Through out the movie, I feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents. However, I feel the father are mother are very loving to their children, even the author try to portrait them as cold, deceitful person.

Being a fan of bad movies, I was thrilled to find a 3 pack of cr@ppy horror at Best Buy today. The set was cheap and included a terrible film called &#34;the Dark&#34; that I actually remember seeing in the theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remaining 2 were equally as bad. &#34;Creatures from the Abyss&#34; being probably the worst of the bunch. Since they were all bad that isn&#39;t saying much. But its stupidity, bad acting, terrible effects and retarded storyline actually made this one a lot of fun to watch. I was rolling on the floor with each new plot development. The discovery of the abandon ship, the missing crew, the realization that there was something terribly wrong!!! It was great!!! Of course, everyone&#39;s favorite scene seems to be the sex scene. OMG!! I almost lost it!!! Between that an the &#34;monster cam&#34;, I have to say I enjoyed this film a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of bad movies so I enjoyed it but in all fairness, I did have to give the movie a 1. IT WAS AWFUL... But if rubbish is your bag, at least rent this one... (YES the BAD pun was intentional)

If you want to see a true thriller, rent this!!! It&#39;s not from the director or screenwriter of &#34;Scream&#34;, doesn&#39;t feature overacting, overpaid &#34;TV&#34; actors passing off as &#34;stars&#34;, and is not a run of the mill special effects bonanza. Instead you&#39;ll get a top-notch, edgy, very strong (in violence) yet thrilling nailbiter.

In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, &#34;Rabbit Seasoning&#34; makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqué for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did. All in all, this just goes to show what geniuses the people behind these cartoons were.

Carlos Mencia was excellent this is hour special. He was working hard to show everybody he was the real deal. I know people have said he&#39;s stolen material in this special, but that is not true. Carlos brings comedy up front the way he wants it, not how anyone else wants it, that is why he is so good. People say he&#39;s not funny because he says Dee dee dee too much, and they still haven&#39;t realized thats part of his act, and they don&#39;t want it that way, but he brings it like that anyway, and succeeds in making people laugh. For all the haters out there, here is a message, Carlos is here to stay, you have no point in trying to bring him down.

Margaret Colin stars as the principal figure in this story; as I watched it, I remembered her bit part in Adrian Lynes&#39;s &#34;Ünfaithful&#34; as Diane Lane&#39;s neighbor in a tony NY neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was surprisingly good, and Diane Stillman deserves credit for an accurate portrayal of class, crimes, and misdemeanors, which actually occur in upscale neighborhoods (perish the thought!!!).It is real but not over-dramatized; the audience lives through her accident, the pain it has caused;denial; and the ultimate resolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more than just a question of &#34;what is a good person&#34; as Colin speaks to her husband....is a person&#39;s character defined by one single act; and should they be condemned forever because of their action?? The questions are pertinent; It is also amusing to see several cinematic references to Martha Stewart (i.e. the fussy, bothersome mother);Colin is reputed by her sometime friends to be a &#34;perfect hostess, with perfect genes&#34;....(gag); and a scene wherein Colin is confronted by police;(the &#34;friends&#34; also betray her, later)....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The denial and facades of American society are addressed; (Oh, murder doesn&#39;t occur here; similar to the theme in &#34;Ä Season in Purgatory&#34;, by author Dominick Dunne, about the true murder of Martha Moxley; in Greenwich, Connecticut); Colin is aware of her crime; but consciously finds herself perpetuating the facade, until she finally breaks down;rent or buy this film; she is an underrated actress who does quite well in these roles.

So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and (not surprisingly) the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, the people laugh, joke etc. This Dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids. They get scared, they start to feel stuff. Oh no, a girl see&#39;s s ghost. Some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc. This girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls, yeah yeah, blah blah. She does but, oh no, she dies as she does. And goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. The script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and Elanor (the one who dies saving the kids) says &#34;oh no&#34;. The acting is wooden, the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again. Basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it, but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss. I was extremely disappointed when I watched this. A very big let down. My sister (who gets sacred very easily) got bored in this film it is appalling.

This film is so copy-cat, cliché-ridden, clumsy, and laboured, I find it astounding that anyone could not feel cheated by the experience of sitting through it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the range of idiotic clichés, ridiculous psychologising, and simply unfeasible storytelling in this &#34;hard hitting&#34; representation of high school: The tough guy jock is really a homosexual. The A-student is unhappy because his father pushes him and somehow this causes him to commit incest. A teacher is mean to a student who wets his pants in class. A girl who is going out with the above-mentioned jock is really in love with him and &#34;just wants a family&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the only saving grace is the student counsellor scenes which are vaguely interesting, but most of the devices in this film are so leaden that it beggars belief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film shows me no insight into teenagers and I will not be surprised when it bombs, especially with teenagers. The people who like this film seem to be parents worried about their teenagers, and boy are they barking up the wrong tree if they think this film will help with &#34;understanding&#34; teen issues. I mean, what is the moral of this film? &#34;Hey guys, let&#39;s all look out for each other and hug each other&#34; GIVE ME A BREAK. Anyone who thinks you can get through to a 14 year old with that kind of message needs to think back. In the 1980s we were watching Kentucky Fried Movie, Xtro, Porky&#39;s, Evil Dead, Terminator, etc. This film will fall on deaf ears. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2:37 is right up there with another Australian &#34;indepedent&#34; film, &#39;One Perfect Day,&#39; which was as bad as this utter turkey of a film. Thank god no taxpayers money was spent on this boloney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVOID!!!!

So it&#39;s a little dated now, it&#39;s almost 30 yrs old. Amazingly enough I have this on BETA tape and it still plays just fine. If it came to DVD I&#39;d snap it up in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drug humor is not appreciated nowadays as it was back then. Then it wasn&#39;t as &#39;harmful&#39;. Much like driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. I can remember my father crying he was laughing so hard watching this. I had coworkers in the 90&#39;s who&#39;d seen it and I could bust them up by getting on the intercom and saying &#34;Iiiiiiiivvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great lines, great spoof of the original, and funny to me anyway even three decades later!

This guy has no idea of cinema. Okay, it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth, and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship. This all is very good, but look carefully: HE DOES NOT KNOW HIS JOB! The scenes are unbalanced, without proper start and and, with a disordered content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say about the subject, so he over-licitates with violence, nakedness and gutter language. How is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art? Why don&#39;t they let him succumb in piece?

I&#39;ll start with what I liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the songs, everything about them was great, the costumes, music, lyrics (as long as the translation was good :) ), choreography, everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the crab scene and the cooking scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#39;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get it, arty cinema, blablabla, but too much is too much. Too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time, really...), too much boredom (no movie should ever be boring, no matter how deep it was to be!), too much porn-like scenes (I do get it really, I get that they were filming a porn movie there, but really, REALLY, really that is too much) I truly think, that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for the songs.

This is a gem, a real piece of Americana for all that this implies. If you are self programed to resist &#34;life-afirming&#34; stories, just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe. And what makes the frosting on the cake truly delectable is that it is fact based on a real rags to riches story, no need to nit-pick what details were changed to make a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest living actors, and the complex, self-conflicted, bottom-line good at the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by someone with his skill and insight. The simple minded comments, refusing to accept a father who tries to lay down the law all the while sensing that he may possibly be off-track, expose the limitation of the commentator, not the writers or the acting. This is not for the cynical, or the simple minded.

This is a FANTASTIC film. Hána is a very old guy with a very young heart. He knows how to live his live fully everyday by teaming up with his friend making pranks on just about everything, even his own death. While his wife can&#39;t deal with his &#34;irresponsible&#34; behavior, she also knows that it&#39;s exactly why she loves her husband for almost half century. I would love to hang out with this old guy because he knows how to enjoy live and never fear of death. He is joyful, witty, mischievous, and never boring. Vlastimil Brodský brilliantly played Hána at the age of 79. Every look from his eyes and every move from his aging muscles deliver so much about the character to the audience. This is a film that leaves a big smile on my face afterwards, and it makes me look at my own live a little closer. Tomorrow I am gonna go and buy myself a mansion and have some fun. If Hána can, so can I. But I think I will skip the smoking part.

I picked this film up based on the plot summary and critics&#39; quotes on the back of the box. I&#39;m not big into foreign films, and didn&#39;t know what to expect. I don&#39;t really care for subtitles either. But I absolutely loved it! It has a simple, lovable quality that leaves you feeling good about life. I found myself laughing out loud repeatedly. I&#39;d recommend this picture to anyone, even those who abhor foreign films with subtitles. This one makes it worth the effort.

A few summer space campers actually were accidently sent into space by a robot. And the oxygen in ship was running short. They had to sent someone to a space station to get the gas tanks, etc, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this movie&#39;s plot is not possible in real life. But it gives a warm feelings of anything is possible if you set your heart in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years. (I saw this movie for the first time in the year of 2000, it was filmed in 1986) There are quite a few people in that movie who are still working in Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The view was great from outer space. It does not look unreal. It is about 2 hours long, it runs so fast that you won&#39;t even notice. You know that it is not real, but you just get sucked into it until the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good family movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Fate/Stay Night is an animated series inspired by a h-game. Somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h-stuff. It couldn&#39;t have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way it&#39;s pictured in this series and any alteration of that could only ruin perfection.(You&#39;ll understand once you see all the episodes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite a relatively slow start (the producer took his time on presenting the characters) things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid-series the action gets so intense that glues you to your seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The topic of the series concentrates on the War of Holy Grail that has been taking place in the Fukuky City for the last 50 years. The pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on. Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city.He unwillingly witnesses a fight between two Servants that triggers his Reiju (Holy mark) to summon one of the most powerful Servants of the battlefield, Saber. His first contact with Saber left him stunned &#34;Such immeasurable beauty ...I was at a lost for words&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You mustn&#39;t compare this series with any other to fully understand it&#39;s plot. FSN offers much more than some cool sword fights, good animation, spectacular lights, great soundtrack, it offers excellent character and relationship development. It presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events precipitate. The action reveals believable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals (not similar to the linear type other series use) that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal, from under the mask of perfection, flawed characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such. You shouldn&#39;t watch FSN thinking that it doesn&#39;t present the viewer with the historic fact, just remember that this is adventure/fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can. The ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes I would have watched them in the same breath.

&#34;That &#39;Malcom&#39; show on FOX is really making a killing... can&#39;t we do our own version?&#34; I speculate and paraphrase, of course, but in our hearts we all know it&#39;s true, and that the only thing NBC added to the &#39;Malcom&#39; metric was sex. And, boy, did they add sex...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen-year-old Tucker gets a boner and covers it up with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally walks in on his Aunt in the shower and she accuses him of watching her and beating off. He spies on the cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window, and she knows he wants to see her topless but she teases him by smiling and closing the window. And this is all in the pilot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it from a grown man- a boy&#39;s puberty is so sex-crazy and testicle-driven it is impossible to make it funny for a mainstream audience. The only times anyone has ever come close has been in movies, and you can count those on one hand. So it&#39;s no surprise that &#34;Tucker&#34; has the warmth and appeal of a strip-club bathroom. Did the network actually think we would like watching kids grapple with puberty? Isn&#39;t this the stuff people go to jail for? If you doubt the show&#39;s depravity consider this: 13 episodes were filmed but NBC canceled it after only 4 episodes aired; they then made the unprecedented move of &#34;burning off&#34; the remaining episodes by airing them AT MIDNIGHT so no children could see them. Ironic since kids were originally the target audience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from its general scuzziness Tucker features a running voice-over from the lead character to flesh out the shoddy writing. Even in 2000 it was horribly dated, with it&#39;s ska incidental music and super-sarcasm. I couldn&#39;t like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes didn&#39;t exactly come a mile-a-minute... Shame on NBC for this dirty rip-off... they&#39;re better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE: C-

Gung Ho is one of those movies that I never get tired of watching. Michael Keaton has always been a favorite of mine, &amp; he is absolutely hilarious in this movie. Matching him step for step is Gedde Watanabe. The two of them work wonderfully together. Although this movie is a comedy, I also like how it shows Hunt (Keaton) &amp; Kazihiro (Watanabe) struggling in their roles as the leaders of their respective groups. They both try so hard to keep the peace, &amp; then they finally get into a fight (which is hysterical to watch). First, they&#39;re both on the floor. Then Hunt jumps on a chair. Kazihiro jumps on the desk. Hunt jumps on the desk with him. The fight then spills out from the office into the factory. I love that after they are separated by the workers, you can tell that they both feel bad for letting things get so out of hand. Also, there is a scene where you can see the influence that Hunt has had on Kazihiro. He is at his house &amp; his boss from Japan arrives &amp; says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kazihiro: Tomorrow not good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: Factory is locked &amp; we can&#39;t find key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tell me you can&#39;t picture Michael Keaton saying something like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I really like this movie because it is genuinely funny, &amp; also shows how people that are radically different can not only learn from each other, but become good friends as well.

In life, we first organize stones (Piedras in Spanish) such as a career, family, friendship, and love. In this way, we shall find space between these to fit smaller stones, our small necessities. If you act in an inverse way, you will not have enough room for larger stones. The five protagonists in this film are women who have not been able to organize the large &#34;stones&#34; in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a Spanish motion picture director defines his first feature Stones in this way. The film tells the parallel, conflicting trajectory of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-), and Maricarmen (Vicky Pena, 1954-).All are endeavoring to remove the stones that insistently appear in their path or, worst, that are in their shoes. They are five Cinderellas in search of Prince Charming and a new chance in life. The best story of these five Cinderellas is that of Anita (Monica Cervera) who also stars in &#34;20 Centimeters,&#34; &#34;Busco,&#34; &#34;Crimen Ferpecto,&#34; &#34;Entre Vivir y Sonar,&#34; &#34;Hongos,&#34; and &#34;Octavia.&#34; Sarge Booker of Tujunga, California

In this film, made JUST as the production code was being enforced, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is the wisecracking, man-chasing sidekick &#34;Kitty&#34;. Girl from Missouri starts out with the girls getting on a train, with Eadie making a promise to herself to earn money while looking for a millionaire husband, staying whole-some in the process. It doesn&#39;t take her long to meet up with Frank Cousins, (Lewis Stone, was the kindly Doctor in Grand Hotel, as well as Judge Hardy in the &#34;Andy Hardy&#34; films.), but all is not as it seems...The censors must have LOVED Harlow&#39;s line &#34;A girl couldn&#39;t accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged.&#34; Later, someone says &#34;You know we&#39;ve never been alone together&#34; and Eadie replies &#34;Yeah, and we&#39;re not going to be!&#34; Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige, another rich, uppercrust who comes to her rescue when trouble comes looking for Eadie. At one point, Paige declares &#34;You oughta scratch me off your list - I&#39;m not a ladies man&#34;.... I wonder what that line would have been just a couple years earlier before the Hayes code came rolling into town. What was he really saying? Carol Tevis seems to be the high-pitched &#34;Baby Talker&#34; as listed in the credits on IMDb. Looks like she was only in showbiz from 1931 - 1939, with &#34;Munchkin&#34; in Wizard of Oz being the last part she played. Fun, cleancut romp as the girls chase men around the country. Look for Nat Pendleton as the lifeguard, who was an Olympic Wrestler 1920 (silver medal winner) turned film star (he was in many of the Dr. Kildares, and would appear in four of Harlow&#39;s films.) Mistaken identity, plot twists, a young Franchot Tone, love stories, even Jean Harlow in a bathing suit in &#34;Palm Beach&#34;, although the outdoor scenes of downtown appear to be a backdrop.

I&#39;ve seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie. To my surprise, the movie held to my every expectations. It&#39;s a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, nice songs (not great though, and that actually explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and all in all a great use to my time. I was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that I have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cry today just like it made me cry then. Maybe that&#39;s because my dog died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that&#39;s why filmmakers make films (that and the money, of course). Yes, there are continuity glitches. Yes, the script has holes, but it doesn&#39;t matter. The movie itself is fun and smart. So don&#39;t be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10 not because it is perfect. It gets 10 simply because it made me feel.

I did not really want to watch this one. It seemed to be an old Raj Kanwar movie which disgusted me even before I started watching it because I don&#39;t consider him even close to being mediocre as a filmmaker. The only reason I took this one is obviously the Shahrukh Khan appearance in the film. I had not even known what the film was all about because I was sure it would be just an ordinary fairy tale. So I just imagined a love story between Shahrukh Khan and Divya Bharti with a substantial supporting role by Rishi Kapoor who I thought would be playing her father or uncle. And to my complete shock, Rishi Kapoor is actually the hero! He is the one who romances the young Divya! I was saddened to find out that Shahrukh had a small part of no substance and that too, only in the second part of this idiotic film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just let me repeat the question: why would a 17 year-old lovely Divya have fallen for a 40-plus long haired, chubby, swollen piglet like Rishi Kapoor? Rishi Kapoor should be ashamed of taking this part; the only thing he did is ridiculing himself. He romanced a girl who could logically be younger than his own daughter and to make things worse -- acts like a teenager at his forties. On top of that, just to make himself more pathetic, he plays a pop-star...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make things clear, I have no problems with actors romancing ladies much younger than they themselves are. As long as they make a convincing couple, there should be no problem. In fact, leading actors have always been cast opposite young girls (Amitabh Bachchan-Sridevi, Mithun Chakraborty-Madhuri Dixit, Shahrukh Khan-Deepika, Salman Khan-Sneha Ullal) and made the pairing pretty well. Also, I have nothing against Rishi Kapoor, I think he is a good actor, and his act in Bobby is still well-engraved in my heart, but it&#39;s not that he looks in this film like, say, Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan or Aamir Khan look today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was such a disappointment. Oh, and as for the reason every person actually watched this film, Shahrukh Khan made a good debut. He excelled in the very little his part allowed him to do. The late Divya Bharti made a promising debut as well. If you want to watch this film, go for the second half only. Personally, I would not do even that.

This is a pretty good documentary. I&#39;m not a skateboarder, I don&#39;t particularly like skateboarding or skateboard culture. But somehow for about 2 hours this movie made me interested in the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#39;t call it the most intriguing film of all time, but for some reason when those guys were talking about how they started their skateboard clubs and were skating in those empty Southern California pools, I was interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also add that the music in this film was pretty good too. I don&#39;t sit around yearning to hear more 70s rock bands, but it seemed appropriate for what they were talking about.

Just saw this movie version of Frank Loesser&#39;s Guys and Dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen this before. She was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And she thought the Havana sequences where Simmons and Brando dance up a storm were excellent. Those were pretty impressive to me too and were usually the highlights of the film. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this movie which originated as a story by Damon Runyon takes a while with the slow pacing of the non-musical scenes at first but pulls you in after a while. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine wasn&#39;t as compelling to me but still had their charms especially during the &#34;Sue Me&#34; number. Also loved Stubby Kaye&#39;s &#34;Sit Down, You&#39;re Rocking the Boat&#34; number and the performances of Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. With a theatrical look throughout, Guys and Dolls isn&#39;t a great film musical but certainly a very good one.

Dark Harvest is about a group of friends that go to a farm(it belongs to one of the friends relatives or something) for a getaway. But there are killer scarecrows lurking there(there was something about a curse in there too but I forgot what that was about).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting in this movie is awful, I don&#39;t know what the director was thinking when he was casting actors and actresses. The script is the same story as the acting &#34;awful&#34;(this statement coming up is very obvious but..) if there was better acting and a better script this could have turned out &#34;okay&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directing stunk too, I see no potential in this guy&#39;s future. After all these negatives this movie still maintains a &#34;fun&#34; factor that bumps it up to a two. The last plus is they don&#39;t use CGI! My overall thoughts on this film are it&#39;s bad, real bad, but so bad it&#39;s &#34;fun&#34; so it gets a 2/10

This series and Elon Gold were being HYPED as &#34;the next big thing&#34; in sitcoms for NBC. Well, they weren&#39;t. Dennis Farina was terribly miscast as the father in-law. He just seemed so uncomfortable and out of place here. The term, &#34;Private &#39;convo&#39; time!&#34; was supposed to become the &#34;Dyno-mite!&#34; catch phrase of the 21st Century. Well, it wasn&#39;t. People were asking then, as they still are today (When his name comes up.), &#34;Who the hell is Elon Gold?&#34; I saw him on an episode of &#34;The Mentalist&#34; this evening. I mentioned his name, and my girlfriend asked, &#34;Who?&#34; Not funny. Total waste of airtime. NBC had really HIGH hopes for this show, but it just fell flat.

Someone commented that Charlie Sheen&#39;s character should be court martialed for doing whatever he wanted. You may be right, but that is how SEAL&#39;s truly are. I served for several months with a SEAL team out of Norfolk, VA. Actually, I should say they used our ship to deploy themselves around Europe for a couple of months. I was the postal clerk on board and everyday these guys would try to get their mail. Since only one person was allowed to pick up the mail each day we issued one pass to one person. Each day a different SEAL would come up pretending to be someone else. Well, after the third time I said no to them until I had proof who they were. They went NUTS!!! I thought they were gonna bust through my cage, gag me, and then steal the mail. Luckily I had not only the President on my side (The Navy), but the Federal Government (US Mail). That was the only time I saw the SEALs stopped from having whatever they wanted. They were allowed unlimited shore leave, where we had to be back on ship at a certain time. They killed and tortured a woman in France and the two SEAL&#39;s only got a 1 week detention on ship, whereas a Seamen was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a French wine shop and he got a court martial. Is it any wonder why the SEAL&#39;s retention rate is over 85%? As a SEAL you are god. So this movie does a pretty accurate job of portraying how a SEAL acts and thinks... unfortunately it is so unbelievable to normal people that it comes off as being fake.

Spoiler warning!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably my least favourite Cary Grant film. I spent most of the time thinking: ignore him, leave him etc. Is he trying to kill her? Should we assume that after the end, when he persuades her to return home with him, that he will kill her after all? I see from checking in a couple of books that this is a reading that some viewers/critics have taken. Finishing early is after all a more reasonable way to film a book, than to change the ending - and this is a more unreasonable change of ending than, for example, in Altman&#39;s The Long Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock&#39;s earlier example of making the murderer not the murderer because a star has been cast (when Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, Ivor Novello&#39;s murderous habits are not mentioned) the book&#39;s ending is not definitely ruled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Robin Wood&#39;s Hitchcock&#39;s Films Revisited, he writes: &#34;As one mentally &#39;swiches&#39; from ending to ending , the significance of every scene changes, the apparent solidity of the narrative dissolves, the illusion of the fiction&#39;s &#39;reality&#39; disintegrates, the film becomes a &#39;modernist&#39; text in which the process of narrative is foregrounded.&#34; I enjoy playing intellectual interpretation games as much as anyone else, but unless the film stands on a straightforward reading, then it fails. This one fails. Even after considering the fatal glasses of milk that recur in a few Hitchcock films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An annoying quibble. The year is 1941. Nothing in the film says that it is set in the past. Beaky (Nigel Bruce) keeps his money in a Paris Bank, and goes there to do financial business? Does he not know that there is a war on? Indeed, were there still any flights from Croydon airport? Is he on good terms with the Nazis? How come it is never suggested that the Germans shot him as a spy or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A curiosity. When Johnnie and Lina have dinner with Isobel, the mystery writer, and her brother, the pathologist, there is a fifth person present, who is never explained nor introduced - a woman in a tuxedo. The credits say that she is Nondas Metcalf playing Phyllis Swinghurst. Is this not an example of how lesbians were coded in &#39;40s films? Are we to take her as Isobel&#39;s lover? The books that discuss overt and hidden gays/lesbians in Hitchcock (e.g. Robin Wood again) do not include Phyllis Swinghurst.

I think this movie was made as good as it could have been. With only 4 months and a 52000$ budget - I&#39;m surprised this wasn&#39;t worse. If you are not to care about the CG or special effects, this movie is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, the movie is not that well made (I&#39;m sure it could have been but, you try to do better in only 4 months) but the story is good and the movie is rather exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOn&#39;t trust me when I say that this movie is good, cause I also find the 1933 King Kong to be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must confess that I didn&#39;t watch the complete movie either... I might have fast forwarded some minutes here and there...

I had heard interesting critics on this movie. I believed it was a love story but I wasn&#39;t sure what was the plot about. So, when I finally saw it, I found myself in the middle of a love relationship between the ex-con Isabel (Isabel Ampudia) and the junkie Rufo (Sebastián Haro). So, a love story but not probably what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is focused on Isabel, as she struggles to get back into society. She doesn&#39;t want to return back to her neighborhood and she finds herself without a home or anywhere to go. So, while she just experiences those first hours of freedom after being released from jail she came across Rufo, an old acquittance of her which while she was in had become a junkie and lives on the streets. Not having where to go, and without money or feasible source of income, she decides to join Rufo on his residence: a covered area on a lonely street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story by itself is moving. It explains how the, impossible, relationship between Isabel and Rufo gets deeper until the the almost final twist of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, the movie is worth watching. Sebastián Haro is splendid in his role of the junkie. A person being able of both being an innocent and tender giving person and a ruthless street scum. Just depending whom deals him with. I believe his role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I don&#39;t quite believe the role of Isabel Ampudia. Although the movie tries to show the bitterness inside her through several scenes, she is not capable to make me believe it. She is in a way too sweet and too honest for which might be expected of somebody on the same situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie tries to show a love on a desperate situation. It is a enjoyable movie. But the feeling I get when the movie ends is that Isabel, with the way of thinking and acting she has, would never have arrived to that situation. Her role, partly because of the script, partly because of the acting is difficult to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I specially like the ending, and because of it I have raised my rating one or two points. I liked its bittersweetness and the fact of showing that sometimes, survival instinct is above other more spiritual considerations as love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summarizing, an interesting movie, but it lacked some punch to be a total &#34;must see&#34;.

What a waste of talent. A very poor, semi-coherent, script cripples this film. Rather unimaginative direction, too. Some VERY faint echoes of _Fargo_ here, but it just doesn&#39;t come off.

Gurinda Chada&#39;s semi-autobiographical film (2002) is a gentle, poignant comedy set in the ethnically diverse community near Heahthrow Airport in West London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the airliners which constantly arrive and depart from overhead, we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley) as they strike up an unlikely friendship which centres around their mutual passion for soccer and their technical infatuation with David Beckham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of the comedy grows out of the misunderstandings of the families of these two talented girls as they break all the expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere in the middle, as broker, peacemaker and blighted athlete, Joe (Jonathan Reece-Myers) - team coach for the Hounslow Harriers - intercedes in times of crisis, while at the same time remaining the main object of affection of both the main characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the way, we finally see our dedicated and beloved soccer heroines soaring away to realise their dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With great performances from Bollywood veteran Anupam Kher (Mr Bhamra), Shaheen Khan (Mrs Bhamra), Juliet Stevenson (Mrs Paxton) and Frank Harper (Mr Paxton) this really is a film that captures the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic frontiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinky Bamrha (Archie Panjabi) and (Taz) Trey Farley are struggling their own struggles, but nevertheless contribute greatly to our understanding of the main characters in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In it&#39;s own special way, this film tells an important story that in quite incidental the football. It celebrates the evolution in the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of the young to teach the old.

UP AT THE VILLA fooled me into thinking I`d be watching something similar to GOSFORD PARK . The film opens at a ballroom in 1930s Italy which is populated by vulgar Americans and uptight upper class Brits , but in truth UP AT THE VILLA plays out far more like a Merchant -Ivory production which is very bad news because it`s a very slow , and I do mean very slow romantic drama with some of the romance being very unlikely . If you like slow romantic dramas you might like this movie . I didn`t

Marvelous film again dealing with the trials and tribulations of World War 11 England. What makes this film so good is the touching of the human element.This film is definitely in the tradition of such British line classics such as &#34;Mrs. Miniver&#34; and &#34;Hope and Glory.&#34; As is the case with this film, we see the desperation of people in the time of war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered John Thaw, who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the London bombing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We soon see why this child wets his bed. He comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life. When the child is returned to his mother, the old man goes to London and seeks him out only to find tragedy. He literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boy&#39;s home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture is so good because it deals and builds on endearing relationships.

In a nutshell: this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really WANTS and TRIES to be something more. It wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate. It wants to be deep and human. It has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which give it the feel of an important movie. The dialog is smart -- at times. There are some &#34;laugh out loud&#34; moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#39;s what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic late-night-cable, in-flight, time-killer: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. David Schwimmer -- how many times can Joe sad-sack puppy dog stare blankly into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying? Maybe some drool would have helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Gwenneth Paltrow -- she&#39;s really flat here and not just in the chest. Her role is supposed to be this lively, nice, caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations, is very confused as a result, and that is why a sad-sack loser like Schwimmer has any chance with her. But Gwenneth plays her very dull. Combine this with puppy-dog drool-face (above) and you have very little chemistry to care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I kept picturing someone else in this role -- Kate Hudson for example.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The script and the plot -- the stuff that happens just basically doesn&#39;t ring true; all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and tidy bow on top that it seems like a whistle blew and the script writers just said &#34;oops, time to wrap it up, got a train to catch!&#34; So they pulled out the Hollywood formula book, checked off all the boxes, and went home.

You ever get that itch to just kill an hour or two doing chores and watching a movie so bad it defies reason? Well, out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the T-Rex. Knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was the T-Rex from Jurassic Park, I KNEW I had to rent this just cause I was in the mood for a bad movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mad scientists, secret formulas, a company more concerned about its fortune and shareholders than lives, and of course, a big, poorly animated, sock-puppet T-Rex. Is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies? Not to mention the Rex&#39;s hungry is never satisfied...ever. How he has hungry is beyond me because he actually doesn&#39;t have an throat (Really if you look down his mouth when he roars, it&#39;s solid...like a toy or something). Now, I like watching incredibly bad B-Movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is. This one was hilarious. I&#39;m not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes where, make no mistake, you will laugh. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I blame the movie&#39;s budget...yes, but the acting didn&#39;t help either. OK, Tony Todd was actually pretty good, as for some of the female roles...when you cry shouldn&#39;t &#34;tears&#34; come out? Meh, I am not going to be angry at this movie, i knew what i was getting into and if you&#39;re looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here&#39;s what I recommend: Watch this movie, then immediately watch Jurassic Park and then Lost World back to back. You will be writing Mr. Spielberg thank you letters the next day.

I caught this for the first time a few nights ago on television. I expected to only tune in for a few minutes, but found myself intrigued by the movie. I ended up watching it all and found it surprisingly compelling. The acting by the three American leads was quite good, especially that of Alex Cord. He plays a gunslinger with quite a degree of vulnerability. Very different from how most of them are portrayed in westerns. He ended up in several situations where he was at the mercy of the bounty hunters. The final shootout between the three leads and the bad guys was very good, as was the scene where the doctor digs a bullet out of Clay McCord. Somewhat gruesome, but realistic. I must admit that, despite my initial misgivings at watching a &#34;spaghetti western&#34;, I ended up enjoying this film quite a bit. I would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.

This is an interesting left turn for Reel 13 Indies. TWO HARBORS is a B&amp;W 75 minute film from Minnesota that features non-actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life. I applaud the boldness of the Reel 13 programmers of thinking out-of-the-box when selecting this film. I just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with. As a matter of fact, I wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself (Not that TWO HARBORS is completely without merit, but I&#39;ll get to that a little later). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is common with independent films, TWO HARBORS is limited in terms of location. There are only two real locations  a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer, which is the home of the middle-aged main character, Vic, played by Alex Cole. Writer/director James Vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about Vic, who is one of the dealers there. He has various people walk up to Vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information  Vic sells space toys (he prefers to call them &#34;outer space action figures&#34;) and he is a caustic asshole. This is emblematic of one of the two key problems with TWO HARBORS - all the chatting. I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again  we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually. There are exceptions, of course, but generally, endless patter is not so engaging on film  particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition. Pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose. A notable example would be a few scenes which feature Vic trying to play himself off as a Boy Scout leader in order to get a discount at a store. He argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes don&#39;t even advance the plot one iota. This is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem with TWO HARBORS is the acting. I may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film, but I really don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s a good excuse for not having good actors in your films. There are plenty of good actors out there, many of which willing to work on low-budget projects  even in Minnesota. Many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals, but that is naïve. In narrative film-making, next to the story, nothing is more important than the acting/performances. If you don&#39;t believe the people enacting your story, your audience is lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I thought Vculek was using non-actors, but as the film went on, I decided that they were probably community theater-type actors. It wasn&#39;t that they were uncomfortable on camera. It&#39;s that they were overly theatrical (i.e. big). Granted, the best of the actors were the two leads  Cole and Catherine E. Johnson as Cassie, a lonely young girl that gets caught up in Vic&#39;s extra-terrestrial hunt. They seemed to have the most training, but they were still a little rough around the edges. The eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only - not coming from a real, organic place within. Ms. Johnson, in particular, is an interesting case. She definitely has a presence  a Midwestern charm about her, but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have. She struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and (slave?) labor, relying on stock gestures like eye rolls, lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned in the first paragraph that TWO HARBORS is not completely without merit and here&#39;s what I mean. Without giving too much away, there is a fade to white an hour into the film. After that, the story takes a stunning turn, which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful  it&#39;s like a sucker punch to the gut, but in a good way. It&#39;s almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters. The last five minutes of the film don&#39;t have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film  subtle, detailed (Cole does his best work of the film) and most importantly, cinematic. Then, with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all  that it&#39;s based on a true story, which got me to thinking. With all the dialogue, the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities, it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening re-write, TWO HARBORS might make a really kick-ass stage play  maybe even a one-act. If there are any bold theater producers out there reading this, I definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker, Reel 13 or whomever. There might be something to this story after all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For more information on this or any other Reel 13 film, check out their website at www.reel13.org)

&#34;Addictive&#34; is an adjective I&#39;ve heard many times when talking of certain TV shows. Most recently, dramas like Lost, Heroes and Prison Break have earned that description. However, as compelling as they may be (and they really are) I can wait a few days before I see the next episode of either series, even Prison Break which some have lazily classified as &#34;the new 24&#34;. With all due respect, there can be no such thing, and for a good reason: no other silver-screen thriller is based on a real-time structure. That&#39;s what sets 24 apart from any other show, and that&#39;s why I practically have to watch an entire season (on DVD) in seven days or less: once the frickin&#39; clock starts ticking, it&#39;s impossible to tune out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An episode whose events unfolded over the course of a single day was a trademark of NYPD Blue (and, more recently, Deadwood); having an entire season of a new series last 24 hours, one per ep (the actual running time is 41 minutes; the remaining 19 are occupied by commercials when the show airs on telly), was the most groundbreaking idea in mainstream television since Hill Street Blues introduced non-linear storytelling (a mandatory element nowadays). And it truly paid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically enough, the original plan for the series was to make it revolve around a wedding (fortunately, creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran realized the format was more suitable for a conspiracy thriller), which is probably the reason the first glimpse we get of the hero suggests a cheerful atmosphere: looking extremely relaxed, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is enjoying a game of chess with his daughter Kimberly (Elisha Cuthbert) and, minutes later, being tender with Teri (Leslie Hope), the wife with whom he has just reconciled. As in The Sopranos, though, something unexpected and shocking is just behind the corner: not only has Kim snuck out of her room, Jack also receives a phone call urging him to get to work immediately. At midnight? I&#39;m afraid so: Bauer is a CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) agent, and his boss has acquired reliable intel about a possible hit on the life of David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), an African-American Presidential candidate who will be in Los Angeles for the whole day (oh, right, I almost forgot: events occur on the day of the California Presidential Primary). No time for napping, then: Jack has to spend the next 24 hours working on the case. Unfortunately, he has a tendency to ignore protocol, and that doesn&#39;t sit well with George Mason (Xander Berkeley), a slimy man from Division who has been asked to interfere with the operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is very dense, making the show hard to recommend for those with a short attention span, but anyone willing to take a look will be rewarded instantly: the writing is sharp and precise, the attention to detail unsurpassed, and the suspense is consistently sky-high, mainly thanks to the real-time trickery which considerably enhances the adrenaline level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great quality of this pilot is the characterization: most genre shows (sci-fi and thriller) tend to simply introduce the key players and then define them later on (a textbook example is CSI, where character development is minimal, but then again that matches the show&#39;s unique style), whereas the series debut of 24 offers a rich array of fully rounded people, among whom Jack (Sutherland&#39;s best role - ever!) and Palmer (the real revelation of the show) stand out for being perfectly described after one episode only (the former divided between job and family, reckless but humane, the latter honorable and endowed with great integrity). A couple of supporting parts border on stereotype (Mason and Tony Almeida especially), but two factors ought to be taken into account: a) this is the first episode; b) there&#39;s so much going on most viewers won&#39;t even complain about a &#34;flaw&#34; or two. After all, how many network programs manage to begin with a conspiracy, a missing teenager AND a huge explosion - and still have equally satisfying material for the rest of the season?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tick, tock, tick, tock...

I really liked the movie. I remember reading it several times as a kid and was glad to see a movie had been made about the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was kid-sitting for a boy and a girl, ages 11 and 8 and had to talk the girl in to seeing the movie. But happily, at the end, she was glad she saw it and even said that she wanted to buy it on DVD as soon as it came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were some great laugh-out-loud moments and the movie was not as &#34;gross&#34; as I expected it would be ... tho it did rank pretty high up there on the gross-o-meter ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I cannot figure out is why they had to have the &#34;dilly&#34; line in there that was done by Woody in reference to his private part ... that to me was the only shocker moment (and you could hear the adults in the audience audibly gasp at that moment in the movie) ... I have no clue why that was put in the movie; it added nothing to the actual movie except for that shock/gasp factor ... other than that, a pretty good movie. Nice to see the &#34;Pepsi&#34; girl all grown up.

Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone crazy. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just not my cup of tea. It&#39;s about 8½ minutes too long.

This is a mildly interesting late 80&#39;s gore fest featuring some nasty slugs with a taste for human blood. If you can get past the ridiculousness of the whole thing you might actually get some minor enjoyment out of this. The acting is awful and the plot is simply there to hold the movie together between gory slug attacks, but the movie isn&#39;t a complete waste of time. The special effects are actually quite good, and the gore is well done. It reminded me of the remake of the Blob, probably because of the sliminess of it all. All in all, you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time, but I wouldn&#39;t suggest seeing this movie unless you&#39;ve got a strong stomach and are into this sort of thing.

I could tell this would be a bad one from the trailer, but the lure of the DVD box got me to rent it anyway. Boy was I right..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for some reason the DVD version is VERY fuzzy and unclear at times (in terms of video quality). It appears as if they shot the whole movie with a 20 year old camcorder, it looks so bad. I really did not like the plot, and after watching the movie I was very let down. I will NOT tell any spoilers, but let it be said that the end was so bad that I laughed, it has been done so many times before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole story seems like something that came out of a middle schooler&#39;s English paper. If I had to peg one movie as the worst horror movie I&#39;ve ever seen, this one may just be it. I can&#39;t believe they actually released this film. It really isn&#39;t worth the rent, or a penny of anyone&#39;s money unless you want a good laugh at the movie&#39;s expense.

The Oscar season has arrived so this means a slew of these deep, engaging, powerhouse ensemble films are all over the movie theaters in hopes of gaining an audience and having the opportunity to earn Best Picture in the big show. Among them is this film that is based off a very popular and well-acclaimed play. The original playwright was actually the writer and director of the film adaptation; which comes as a double-edged sword. On one hand, who better to translate the play than the original writer? On the other hand, who better to not see the mistakes and drawbacks of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself? Doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense; with a frustrating ending, unnecessary dialogue, questionable directing, and of course, the inability to provide substantial answers. It is a growing trend among these &#34;high-caliber&#34; films to not answer all questions it provides, and this has to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doubt is like a joke without its punch line, like a book with the final 20 pages missing, like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of a hotly contested football game, and like not having the 50 cents to continue playing the arcade game and see what happens next. Doubt, just like the previous Best Picture frustrationfest No Country For Old Men, doesn&#39;t really end; it doesn&#39;t provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending. Yes, that was the intent, but this isn&#39;t a test of humanity, it&#39;s a cop-out. I do not pay money to see an unfinished work, I pay money to see a beginning, middle, and end, and pray that I don&#39;t fall asleep during the three acts. We are forced to become the &#34;writers&#34; of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little drama is about a nun (Meryl Streep) who seems very sure that the well-beloved priest (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is making sexual advances towards a child that goes to the church; the first African-American boy in the Catholic church. The church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing heinous sins behind everyone&#39;s backs. The plot thickens as some of the kids begin behaving differently, which attracts the notice of a young teacher (Amy Adams). The story is set right after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, which shook the nation for quite some time and questioned their faith in humanity and in each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doubt&#39;s strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the ever-engaging suspense that builds slowly and never boils over. Streep seems to be Oscar-worthy in every role she&#39;s in, and here she is no different as her sternness and cold-hearted behavior places a blanket of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church. Hoffman excels yet again as the priest, by successfully meshing suspicion with a charming personality and a friendly aura. The seemingly hypocritical personality is tough to pull off, especially when we are suppose to like him and also ponder about him at the same time; but Hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers. When these two argue, you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched. But let&#39;s not forget Amy Adams (Enchanted) and Viola Davis (Law ad Order) for their superb job either. Doubt&#39;s casting ensemble is among the best in 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, like previously stated it&#39;s the writing and directing that ruins this film, especially when dwindling down the third act. Questions pop up, but they aren&#39;t answered. Characters pop up, but provide no real enhancement towards the plot. Kids behave different, but we never truly find out why. There are awkward angles in the camera-workandthere&#39;s no actual reason why. John Patrick Shanley, the writer of the play, had one previous film in his directing repertoire: Joe Versus the Volcano. Whether sheer arrogance or stupidity, we are stuck with seeing overdrawn sequences of random conversation, utter annoying chatter that bores to no end (There was a two minute discussion about coffee and how much sugar the priest wanted) thanks to Mr. Shanley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: The lack of an ending is a stupid trend that&#39;s just as irritating as the seizureific camera-work in action films. It doesn&#39;t matter that we have a great talented acting cast, or decent cinematography, or a good story being worked upon, or good usage of sound and music; because we have a barrage of unanswered questions that sprinkles all over a film that is over 100 minutes yet doesn&#39;t even finish! The translation from play to film is good and quite accurate, because we have the original madmen behind the projectbut he took the mistakes and stupid hiccups from the play to the film as well. This decade has seen its share of blockbuster and high-profile films that could have gotten a much higher score from me if they had just decided to add a few more minutes of footage and actually end: Sideways, Cast Away, No Country For Old Men, Burn After Reading are a few examples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newsflash: end your stinkin&#39; movie. Please or at least provide a good amount of clues for us to easily fill in the blank (like Wall-E&#39;s depressing backstories), instead of staring into space as the credits suddenly start rolling and you are left with a feeling of emptiness, confusion, and mental anguish. Have a beginning, middle, and the end please!! As a critic, I prefer my films to be whole, not incomplete. Doubt feels incomplete, which is why it gets an incompetent grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone has to break this stupid trend.

Warning, spoilers ahead (even if I doubt that anybody hasn&#39;t seen this yet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie starts off rather well, but about halfway through it falls apart and becomes a corny, sugary sweet, predictable and unrealistic &#39;harmony romance&#39; mess. I mean, it&#39;s very obvious that there are serious problems in the main characters&#39; marriage, but these problems are never solved but just forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, as soon as she decides to have a baby behind his back (without even asking) all of their problems magically disappear without a trace or an explanation. Given what had happened up until that moment it would have been far more logical if the marriage fell apart rather than becoming the trite and cliche&#39; &#39;having a baby will change everything&#39; ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two main characters&#39; families and neighbours are also extremely one-dimensional, and don&#39;t seem to serve really any purpose if not to irritate the viewer, and they also mysteriously disappear from the movie as soon as the &#39;harmony moments&#39; start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry to be ripping this movie, but given the start I would have expected something more. 4/10 for me.

I am writing this after just seeing The Perfect Son at the 2002 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney, Australia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their Father dies, two estranged brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying from AIDS, they enter on a heart warming journey of reconciliation. The two leads do a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds up between them as the movie progresses. I do have one qualm about the movie though - whilst the brother who is dying acts sick, he doesn&#39;t look it. A person of 0 T4 cells would look quite ill - not even a make up job to make the actor look ill was employed. A small gripe, but one that makes it a bit less realistic. Despite that one small gripe, The Perfect Son is a wonderful movie and should you have the chance to see it- do. I&#39;m hoping for a DVD release in the near future!

This is the best mob film ever made. It deserved more then what it got at the Oscars. Nominated for things like its score, art direction, supporting role (Newman), this film could have easily been nominated for Best Picture, Director (Mendes), Actor (Hanks), Supporting Actor (Newman and Law) and won!! Hanks gives one of his best performances, and the kid who played Michel Jr. was so good that I&#39;m surprised i don&#39;t see him in more movies today. Critics themselves didn&#39;t give this film enough credit. But besides the incredible performances, another real star of this film is the incredible music. This was by far the best score of the year. It was nominated but didn&#39;t win. This is a great film that should be seen by everyone. My Grade-A+

Written by brilliant Monkees&#39; TV writers Gerald Gardner and Dee Caruso,WHICH WAY TO THE FRONT was the last of the &#34;Jerry Lewis&#34; movies until &#34;Hardly Working&#34; almost a decade later. Jerry&#39;s comedy is evidently an acquired taste, and admittedly he can occasionally be his own worst enemy when he helms as producer/director--but even in the dreariest of his films, there are always moments of brilliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHICH WAY manages to be amusing,entertaining and yes,quite funny. It is somewhat unlike any of the typical Lewis films.The pace is very upbeat and ther are lots of excellent supporting players--a kind of JERRY DOES HOGANS HEROES.The whole thing looks kind of like an unsold TV pilot and you will either love it or hate it---but hopefully YOU VILL LAUGH

Scientist working frantically in seclusion finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element. All (pseudo)science and breakthrough technology talks of the 1930s are right there, including the idea that radioactivity could heal any illness if properly harnessed. When he summons his rivals -who had cast him out of the scientific community and ridiculed him - to witness his discovery, they propose a &#39;joint&#39; expedition to Africa...of course they end up stealing much of dr. Rukh&#39;s original discovery, giving him only residual credit. In addition to that, an effeminate weakling who looks like a supporting comedy actor from the worst Abbot&amp;Costello (Lawton) literally steals dr. Rukh&#39;s young trophy wife (Drake), who falls head over heels for that scrap of a human being. Having grown horns like a deer wasn&#39;t going to make dr. Rukh (Karloff) any friendlier, so he embarks in an undercover revenge mission...killing 2 of his foes and friendly dr. Benet (Lugosi), the only one who had helped him...finally succumbing to the deadly radiations that had allowed him to embark in his revenge to start with but ( to my utmost dissatisfaction ) sparing the adulteress and that poor excuse for a human being she had married. Acting is mostly fine, with Karloff &amp; Lugosi being very good. Check the hysterical chambermaid scene... Other characters aren&#39;t worth mentioning... Recommended, much like ALL old Universal horrors...

I love the book, &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; and have seen many versions of it. All have their strong points and their faults. However, this was one of the worst I have seen. I didn&#39;t care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part, but she had no emotion in any of her lines. I couldn&#39;t imagine what Mr. Rochester saw in her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had even less emotion than Jane, if that were possible. How two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery, but it certainly didn&#39;t hold my attention. Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during the production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Timothy Dalton (too handsome for Mr. Rochester!) version is far more faithful to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester in the 1997 A/E version (which is NOT all that true to the book).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.

Nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci-fi movie that&#39;s been vilified at the US box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of Kurt Russell&#39;s career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly when you read negative reviews of this film, they usually start with the wooden nature of Russell&#39;s interpretation of Todd, the eponymous Soldier. I&#39;m going to start here too, with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting I&#39;ve seen Russell pull off. Todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense PTSD - this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The portrayal is spot on. Todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and a loner. He suffers from irrational anxiety - keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger. His hyper-focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within - there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed, not cleaning up the cut or the blood. Many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand, but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote - not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he&#39;s preparing and the food that will be eaten later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Todd&#39;s dialog is spartan to say the least - the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence. Fear and Discipline we are told. Always. Fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by, keeping him ready to react on a knife edge. Discipline to hold him in check through his fear, to overcome it and perform tactically. The inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings. Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from Nielsen&#39;s Sandra - but I believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who&#39;s only experience of an embrace is in combat - the trembling represents him suppressing his fight / flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled, his movement and vision restricted - Fear and Discipline indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the subtext of his abandonment (Twice in fact) - so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they&#39;ve served their terms. 40% of the unemployed are ex-military in OUR world, in HIS it can only be worse. Russell quickly picks up the mantle of Mace&#39;s responsibility to his wife and child - desperately in need of a mission, even one with such a high likelihood of his death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the military subtext too - the conflict between Busey&#39;s Church and the hotshot from HQ, Mekum. Mekum&#39;s new men are faster, stronger, more accurate and aggressive. Any one of them could pound Todd into the ground - but it&#39;s not about the tools you have it&#39;s how you use them. An incentivized Todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit - sent in without support, cover or reconnaissance. It is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in leadership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many other subtle themes. When a film is shot and scripted so minimally, it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root. Watch Soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches YOU.

The movie is wonderful. It shows the man&#39;s work for the wilderness and a natural understanding of the harmony of nature, without being an &#34;extreme&#34; naturalist. I definitely plan to look for the book. This is a rare treasure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Vincente Minnelli directed some of the most celebrated entertainments in cinema history... He was among the first Hollywood directors to show that a profound love of color, motion and music might produce intelligent entertainment... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;American in Paris&#39; is the story of an ex-GI who remains in France after the war to study and paint... He falls in love with a charming gamine Lise Bourvier... Their romantic love affair sparkles as brightly as the City of Lights itself... The whole movie brings a touch of French elegance where technique, artistic style and music all come together in perfect synchronism...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first musical sequence introduces the exciting personality of Leslie Caron in her screen debut... She is like a diamond, a touch of class... George Guetary describes his fiancée ambiguous grace in a montage of different dance styles, sweet and shy, vivacious and modern, graceful and awesome... The number leads to an unpretentious bistro, where Kelly and his very good friends in Paris share a gentle parody of Viennese waltzes... Later Kelly celebrates a popular tap dancing with a crowd of enthusiastic children singing with him &#39;I Got Rhythm,&#39; and at the massive jazz nightclub Kelly spots the girl of his dreams... He is instantly hit by her sparkling sapphire blue eyes, and only one clear thing is in his mind, to pull Lize onto the dance floor and sing to her: &#34;It&#39;s very clear, Our love is here to stay.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the joyful &#39;Tra-La-La,&#39; Kelly provides humor, wit and talent all around Oscar Levant&#39;s room ,and even on the top of his brown piano... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he meets his pretty Cinderella along the Seine river, Kelly is swept away by his happy meeting with Caron... He expresses all his emotions with &#39;Our Love Is Here to Stay.&#39; The piece had a definite nighttime feel as the two lovers were bathed in soft, blue smoky light... They start an enchanting dance-duet juxtaposing differing elements... Caron dances with her head on his shoulder, then tries to run away in a fluid way... They move backward, away from each other, then pause to rush toward each other, for a little kiss, and a warm hug...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film&#39;s weakest numbers were those that bear little relation to the story... In one, Georges Guetary performs an entertaining stage show with showgirls in giant ornaments floating down to the stage... In another, Oscar Levant imagines himself conducting a concert, and playing not only a piano recital, but the other instruments as well... He even applauds to himself as members of the audience...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extravagant climactic super ballet of the film is quite an adventure, a breakthrough in taste, direction and design... It is a blaze of love, fury and vividness... It is Kelly&#39;s major fantasy of his lost love and of his feeling about Paris as viewed through the huge backdrops of some of France&#39;s most Impressionist painters...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number starts at the Beaux Arts Ball after Kelly finds himself separated from Lise, and begins a sketch with a black crayon... It gathers the important parts of the film&#39;s story through a constantly changing locations, all in the style of the painters who have influenced Jerry... The tour, richly attractive and superbly atmospheric, includes the Place De la Concorde Fountain, the Madeleine flower market, the Place De l&#39;Opéra, to his Rendez-Vous at Montmartre, with the cancan dancers in a representation of Lautrec&#39;s Moulin Rouge...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly seems to defy the boundaries of his physical self... Caron seems to dominate her space and sweeps you away to another time and place...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina Foch appeared very attractive and elegant in her one-shouldered white gown... In one of the film&#39;s most famous lines, Kelly asks her: &#39;That&#39;s quite a dress you almost have on. What holds it up?&#34; Nina, cleverly replies, &#34;modesty!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;An American in Paris&#39; garnered six Oscars, including an honorary award to Gene Kelly... The film gave us a wealth of memories to take home...

The barbarians maybe´s not the best film that anybody of us have seen, but really????........It´s so funny......I can´t discribe how mutch I laughed when I first saw it..The director really wanted to do a serious adventure movie, but it´sso misirable bad....so bad that it´s one of the funniest movies I´ve ever seen......so my advise is that you should see it.....and if you alredy did, se it again!!!!!!!

A very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting, but where the hell is the ending to this film?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, what is the point of it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally, and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storyline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performances of the cast are questionable, if not believable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the film? I guess we have to wait for the sequel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You have to see this. I could not stop laughing about the stupidities I saw in this movie even late after the event. There is maybe a million of individual mistakes and stupidities in this movie. The acting is bad. The story is so predictable and flat. The effects are like 50 years old. The supposed thriller is nowhere. You will not enjoy the movie, but you will laugh at it and enjoy laughing at it a long time after it. We had a great time AFTER the movie. Truly. Me and my friend spent entire 40mins long bus trip home chatting about this movie like we have seen next Oscar winner. Sadly we were talking about all those bad things we had just seen.

Amazing acting, music. A simple and clear plot but it drew me in and kept me captivated all the way through. I don&#39;t know why it was so fantastic but it simply was. So many of the characters were so real. It moved me and made me think I would like to watch more like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of a school trip as a forum for such an amazing plot was a genius idea and so many of the people were like people were like those encountered every day by teachers in the classroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film tackles issues of religion, prejudice,drugs friendship, memories, difficult experiences and simple the diversity of life itself.

Ironically the most talked-about American film in the 2008 New York Film Festival is 98% in Spanish. The extra-long film&#39;s controversy began at the Cannes Festival. There were love-hate notices, and considerable doubts about commercial prospects. As consolation the star, Benicio Del Toro, got the Best Actor award there. I&#39;m talking about Steven Soderbergh&#39;s &#39;Che,&#39; of course. That&#39;s the name it&#39;s going by in this version, shown in New York as at Cannes in two 2-hour-plus segments without opening title or end credits. &#39;Che&#39; is certainly appropriate since Ernesto &#34;Che&#34; Guevara is in almost every scene. Del Toro is impressive, hanging in reliably through thick and thin, from days of glorious victory in part one to months of humiliating defeat in part two, appealing and simpatico in all his varied manifestations, even disguised as a bald graying man to sneak into Bolivia. It&#39;s a terrific performance; one wishes it had a better setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are patient enough to sit through the over four hours, with an intermission between the two sections, there are rewards. There&#39;s an authentic feel throughout--fortunately Soderbergh made the decision to film in Spanish (though some of the actors, oddly enough in the English segments especially, are wooden). You get a good outline of what guerrilla warfare, Che style, was like: the teaching, the recruitment of campesinos, the morality, the discipline, the hardship, and the fighting--as well as Che&#39;s gradual morphing from company doctor to full-fledged military leader. Use of a new 9-pound 35 mm-quality RED &#34;digital high performance cine camera&#34; that just became available in time for filming enabled DP Peter Andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold, but at times still sing, and are always sharp and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is in two parts--Soderbergh is calling them two &#34;films,&#34; and the plan is to release them commercially as such. First is &#39;The Argentine,&#39; depicting Che&#39;s leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of Havana in the late 50&#39;s, and the second is &#39;Guerrilla,&#39; and concerns Che&#39;s failed effort nearly a decade later in Bolivia to spearhead a revolution, a fruitful mission that led to Guevara&#39;s capture and execution in 1967. The second part was to have been the original film and was written first and, I think, shot first. Producer Laura Bickford says that part two is more of a thriller, while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes. Yes, but both parts have a lot in common--too much--since both spend a large part of their time following the guerrillas through rough country. Guerrilla an unmitigated downer since the Bolivian revolt was doomed from the start. The group of Cubans who tried to lead it didn&#39;t get a friendly reception from the Bolivian campesinos, who suspected foreigners, and thought of the Cuban communists as godless rapists. There is a third part, a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of Che&#39;s speech at the United Nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time, but that is inter-cut in the first segment. The first part also has Fidel and is considerably more upbeat, leading as it does to the victory in Santa Clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During &#39;Guerilla&#39; I kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality European-style miniseries, which might begin with a shortened version of Walter Salles&#39;s &#39;Motorcycle Diaries&#39; and go on to take us to Guevara&#39;s fateful meeting with Fidel in Mexico and enlistment in the 26th of July Movement. There could be much more about his extensive travels and diplomatic missions. This is far from a complete picture of the man, his childhood interest in chess, his lifelong interest in poetry, the books he wrote; even his international fame is only touched on. And what about his harsh, cruel side? Really what Soderbergh is most interested in isn&#39;t Che, but revolution, and guerrilla warfare. The lasting impression that the 4+ hours leave is of slogging through woods and jungle with wounded and sick men and women and idealistic dedication to a the cause of ending the tyranny of the rich. Someone mentioned being reminded of Terrence Malick&#39;s &#39;The Tin Red Line,&#39; and yes, the meandering, episodic battle approach is similar; but &#39;The Thin Red Line&#39; has stronger characters (hardly anybody emerges forcefully besides Che), and it&#39;s a really good film. This is an impressive, but unfinished and ill-fated, effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 8-years-gestating, heavily researched labor of love (how many more Ocean&#39;s must come to pay for it?) is a vanity project, too long for a regular theatrical release and too short for a miniseries. Radical editing--or major expansion--would have made it into something more successful, and as it is it&#39;s a long slog, especially in the second half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s clear that this slogging could have been trimmed down, though it&#39;s not so clear what form the resulting film would have taken--but with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one.

Ugh. Pretty awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linnea Quigley gets top billing, but her character doesn&#39;t have a big part. Who is her character supposed to be anyway, the little boy&#39;s aunt? Another user commented on her getting nude in a shower scene. While there was a shower scene in the movie, it was a head and shoulders shot. Perhaps there are some alternate versions of this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quigley does have a bigger part than John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell, and Brinke Stevens, though. Carradine shows up briefly in a monkish robe reciting vague dialog. No other characters are in the scene with him, though he&#39;s sort of composited in, or else there are over-the-shoulder shots unquestionably belonging to someone else. There&#39;s also a really bad photo of him in a cameo locket (it looks like a bad photocopy), and a decent picture of him in a family bible. He conjured up Jack-O originally, or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cameron Mitchell briefly shows up on a TV as a TV horror host. Brinke Stevens is in the movie he&#39;s showing &#34;The Coven,&#34; in which she runs around a cemetery in a robe. Evidently there&#39;s more of the Brinke footage as a bonus feature on the Retromedia DVD double feature Mark of the Witch/The Brides Wore Blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack-O: what&#39;s it about? Darn if I know. A little boy is told a story about a pumpkin-headed demon killer, and he and some other kids are scared by a woman they think is a witch for some reason. She follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for Halloween (put your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes, etc.). The pumpkin-headed killer shows up several times to hold onto branches while he watches people, or hold his scythe in front of the camera and pose with it for a while. Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around holding things, and actually kills people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also some flashbacks to a western or prairie family, with the little boy playing the little boy in that family too: ancestors of his, I think. I think they figure into Jack-O&#39;s backstory, but I&#39;m not sure how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little boy is ostensibly the main character, but we don&#39;t really learn anything about him except that he wears glasses, has nightmares, and will fight bullies even if he&#39;ll get beat up in the process. More time should have been spent establishing his character. I couldn&#39;t have cared less if he died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended, not even for Halloween.

Well, here&#39;s another terrific example of awkward 70&#39;s film-making! The rudimentary premise of &#34;What&#39;s the matter with Helen?&#34; is quite shocking and disturbing, but it&#39;s presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion! In the hands of any other movie crew, this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale, but with director Curtis Harrington (&#34;Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?&#34;) and scriptwriter Henry Farrell (&#34;HushHushSweet Charlotte&#34;) in charge, it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres. The basic plot of the film is definitely horrific, but there&#39;s a lot more to experience, like love stories, a swinging 1930&#39;s atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap-dancing! The setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique. We&#39;re literally catapulted back to the 1930&#39;s, with a sublime depiction of that era&#39;s music, religion, theatrical business and wardrobes. Following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life-imprisonment for murder, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shelley Winters) flee to California and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls. Particularly Adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment, as she falls in love with a local millionaire, but poor old Helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia. She only listens to the ramblings of a radio-evangelist, fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies. The script, although not entirely without flaws, is well written and the film is adequately paced. There&#39;s never a dull moment in &#34;What&#39;s the matter with Helen&#34;, although the singing, tap-dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot. But the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of Shelley Winters. She&#39;s downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who&#39;s about to snap any second and, especially during the last ten minutes or so, she looks more petrifying than all the Freddy Kruegers, Jason Voorhees&#39; and Michael Myers&#39; combined! There are several terrific supportive characters who are, sadly, a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential, like Michéal MacLiammóir as the cocky elocution teacher, Agnes Moorehead as the creepy priestess and Timothy Carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies&#39; house. There are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the Grand Guignol fanatics among us, but particularly the set pieces and costume designs (even nominated for an Oscar!) are breathtaking.

Czech cinematography is traveling through dark times... this movie is a tangible evidence. Slama obviously wanted to make a mediocre documentary about fictive people, characteristic of their stupidity. A young and healthy boy who doesn&#39;t want to work and prefer to live in a decaying shack with a feckless alcoholic aunt. Because of the idiocy of Tonik, who&#39;s just able to announce &#34;Dad, I&#39;ll not work in the factory&#34; (I&#39;d really like to know WHY); I understand the condition of his &#34;house&#34;, but I&#39;m really not able to digest the horrible mess around. Cramped sentimentality everywhere. Why didn&#39;t Monika escort her boy to work abroad? Young Czech couples do it very often. And take someone else&#39;s children to live in a devastated barn... that&#39;s too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irresponsible mother (badly acted by Geislerová), naive &amp; stupid boy (Tonik), silly and confused girl (Monika)... Yes, somebody has already told it - badly directed and acted soap opera. Actors like Martin Huba, Bolek Polivka, Tatiana Wilhelmova and Simona Stasova did their best, but unfortunately it couldn&#39;t save the whole piece.

Now after watching The Advent Children twice, the storyline isn&#39;t as shallow as majority has criticized it to be in my opinion. If you haven&#39;t played FFVII or disliked it for whatever reason, this movie is most likely not for you. Being familiar to the original story is a prerequisite to understanding AC fully, otherwise you will just see the greatest CG animation in your life so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without actually spoiling the storyline, I must admit that after seeing AC we have been putting pieces together with my friends relying on our knowledge of FFVII. Seeing it second time allowed to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the questions we may have had were answered. Some were not. AC is clearly for FFVII players/fans and doesn&#39;t honestly try to be anything else. There is little to none realism in it outside FFVII world which serves the purpose. Music is mostly reconstructed FFVII themes with a heavier touch (TBM team according to end credits) and works well with the eye candy without exceptions. I found the music enhancing the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know you can&#39;t put a FFVII in 1.5 hours and keeping that in mind the storyline actually offered more to me than I expected. There are two issues at hand in FFVII : AC and both stories were wrapped up very smoothly between the action sequences. And trust me when I say there&#39;s a lot of it. Action that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m changing my vote from 9 to 10 after watching it the second time because I had missed a few explanatory sequences I couldn&#39;t put together the first time that provided some answers. As a warning, it&#39;s going to be easy to disregard the story and concentrate on graphics, but try not to judge the Adevent Children because of that. If you don&#39;t let the story in, it&#39;s no wonder it seems sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not going to praise the graphics because I assume we all know they are awesome, which might be an understatement. Especially characters talk so much more with their facial expressions than ever before. I hope you pay attention to the storyline for it actually makes sense and works well with the whole. Get ready for the ride of your life, there are no breaks.

I am sick of series with young and clueless people, talking about their &#34;problems&#34; all the time, self centered, boring and absolutely annoying (Popular; Dawson&#39;s Creek; Beverly Hills; etc). &#34;Hack&#34; is a breath of fresh air, with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different plot, credible people with REAL problems (thank God !!) and very, very good histories. I just love it!! I hope &#34;Hack&#34; will go on for a long time, because it is a great television series for grown up people, for a change.

The movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m biased, i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies), and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than Azumi 1. I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating. I amazed myself being able to sit through it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets talk about the plus points of the movie. The girl. Ueto Aya is cute. Thats all there is to salvage the whole movie. The fact is, if the main character was male, i am sure that most people (including me) would not have touched the movie at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now lets talk about the minus points. Firstly, it is real draggy, with lots and lots of repeated scenes. Scenes of Nachi and Azumi keeps coming back. It seems more like a drama way of shooting. Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks, and this movie too. Secondly, the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting. I do not mind unrealistic movies. But this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness, by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs, etc... it reminds me of Shinobi, though Shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting. Moreover, to portray &#34;i-don&#39;t-know&#34; what effect, the director films people dying with blood spraying (literally) all around... people not realizing their head was cut off... etc.. etc... etc... Too many of these spoils the show. It seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie. It degrades the show greatly. Thirdly, Isn&#39;t Azumi supposed to be an assassin. She seems more like an one-man-army to me, just that she is a female. I don&#39;t think you see assassins charging into army camps. The only time i felt she acted &#34;assassin-liked&#34; was when she killed the Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Lastly, the plot was thin in both movies. Its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way.

German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible: he&#39;s unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of EW. I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set. The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent. Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA. Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse), and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sets are excruciatingly bad. The production designer&#39;s budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint &#34;Precinct 707&#34; on a cardboard wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of European emigres (possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands), bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms. Sadly, they couldn&#39;t afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he&#39;s the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies. The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her. Don&#39;t ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommel&#39;s logic and enjoy the absurd ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes. Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Euro-trash techno into the soundtrack. We&#39;re talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other zombies, Lommel&#39;s girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified. This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog. Yes, a golden shower it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#39;t spoil anything by revealing the shock ending. All I can say is it&#39;s perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist.

I was living in Barstow Ca. in 1968 when the movie The Killers Three arrived at the local theater. The trailer was enough to get me to pay my hard earned money to see this movie. I was really expecting a Bonnie And Clyde movie and I got Dick Clark playing a shy nerdy guy while Robert Walker and Diane Varsi played an poor attempt of reinacting Bonnie and Clyde. Needless to say it never went over well. Maybe this is why it never made it to video. Even as a kid I was left some what ripped off as I left the theater. After all the best parts where in the trailer of the movie. The movie was dull and pretty much pointless. By the way, Dick Clark gets killed so it wasn&#39;t a total let down.

I have to admit that Tsui Hark is one of a kind, you can&#39;t top a person with a strong style of movie presence. A Chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience, the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of Zu Mountain and this is what he displayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Legend of Zu has truly improved from the one in 1983. From this new millenium update, we could see Tsui Hark&#39;s vision of the Zu mountains. Spectacular visual designs, amazing action-fantasy epic made beautifully well. Kept me glued through the entire picture. Great cast with just fine acting. It&#39;s truly a fun movie to watch, but is it too weird?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the down side is people will definitely get confused with it&#39;s broad story line shortened down into a 95 minute movie. Plot may not have much relation among characters, but by rewatching the movie, you&#39;ll have a better sense of understanding the characters itself. Some can complain there isn&#39;t too much physical combat, besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat foes, spirits fighting by hand-to-hand wouldn&#39;t really make sense at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciated this nice stylish picture. It may have a thin story, but hey look at Tsui Hark&#39;s &#34;Time &amp; Tide,&#34; we got confused by the plot as well, but it was truly something stylish and awesome. Tsui Hark always attracts something different into H.K. Cinema. American audiences, may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie, cause this ain&#39;t no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, this is a whole new genre. Although it may not be a masterpiece, but it&#39;s special effects is truly better than Storm Riders. This is really worth checking out.

I&#39;m always interested to see neglected movies that appear to have good credentials, but in this case the film&#39;s neglect appears justified. Evidently based on some actual incidents during WWII, the film just doesn&#39;t connect with the viewer for some reason that it is not quite clear to me. One very likely reason is that - in the print I saw on TCM, anyway - none of the scenes where the Germans talked among themselves were given titles. This interesting directorial concept - to let the non-German speaking viewer just guess from &#34;context&#34; what the Germans are saying to each other - is, in my book, an utter flop and helps to lock the viewer out. Also, the way the movie begins - just dropping us into a very confused situation without much setup - is disorienting. Brian Keith is pretty good here, but the reputations of &#34;The Great Escape&#34; and &#34;Stalag 17&#34; will not be challenged by this flick.

For those of us that lived thru those weeks of filming in town and around the Valley - lest we not forget the tedious days of road closures and &#34;film-making&#34;. As a reminder to those that live here - locales include Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. etc. The bank was the BC firehouse; chase scenes included Moon Drive off Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd, and Hwy 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most approachable, Matt Broderick was above us all - even back then. As far as the film goes - a joke of a script and even a bigger laugh regarding acting and plot - but who cares at this level. A nice time capsule for those that enjoy our coast and valley scenery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional notes; Joe&#39;s Bar (Jed&#39;s Tavern in the film), original name of the film was Welcome to Buzzsaw - the Old Erba&#39;s parking lot was the town square, the backyard shots were off of Grove Street in Boulder Creek; turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early days.

&#34;Black Water&#34; is a movie that in a way surprised me, and definitely exceeded my original expectations. &#34;Black Water&#34; is truly a very well structured, unpredictable, thrilling, well directed, and well creepy movie. The plot is actually somewhat original, and will definitely keep you intrigued with it. One thing I love about this movie is the direction, because mainly on how it surpassed my original expectations. My original expectations of &#34;Black Water&#34; was that it was a crappily made, acted, directed, paced, and boring movie. It really wasn&#39;t. Well the acting is nothing to praise because there were times were I feel they didn&#39;t show enough emotions, and there are some lines that feel just so scripted. However I love the direction because all of it&#39;s shots seem predictable, but arn&#39;t. Like when watching it say the camera gets a slow shot of the water, and it goes quite, you&#39;re like the croc&#39;s about to attack. However the croc&#39;s attacks are very unpredictable(which was bad for me who doesn&#39;t handle films like this all to greatly), and this does make you jump. Plus I just love that it&#39;s one of those horror movies that don&#39;t rely on the sudden big sound blast to make you jump, but instead the actual movie. I also like how the story is about people who are trapped in these trees, it made it seem very real, and definitely kept your eyes on the screen. I must say I didn&#39;t think the opening 20 so minutes were done well, and I think they made the boat a little heavier than it would have been in real life. Plus I didn&#39;t like how they tried their absolute best to make the characters situation seem entirely hopeless when it really wasn&#39;t. Also again I just don&#39;t think some of the characters actions were realistic. For example I wouldn&#39;t have gone anywhere near the water knowing their was a crocodile in it, let alone a killer one. However these problems really arn&#39;t that major, and I was still able to enjoy the film. Overall as far as movies go, I&#39;ve seen better, but as far as animal attack horror films(a genre I get easily scarred at) it&#39;s one of the better ones you&#39;ll see. And sure it&#39;s not perfect, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not worth a shot.

This film reinvents the term &#34;Spring Breakumentary.&#34; Hans, the fat one of the group, displays his talents as this generations Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, &#34;the King of the $1 bet,&#34; shows he&#39;s not in Kansas anymore by consistently upping the stakes. Kyle&#39;s laugh is truly infecting, and offers a little eye-candy for the ladies as well (as does Matt). The dwarfs, while having their moments, did not do justice to the Mexican hat dance like it deserves. And last, we have our protagonist, Ed. He gives hope to all of us bumbling, stumbling, gangly, pale folk who are still searching for that special someone. And that hope, is a little place called Cabo San Lucas. While this blockbuster just missed the theaters, this is a must rent, as we can all relate to one of these Spring Breakumentarions.

&#34;Jaded&#34; should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like &#34;Indecent Behavior&#34; or &#34;Friend Of The Family&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Jaded&#34; is not an easy watch as it&#39;s story is difficult to conceive and it&#39;s not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The raping scene wasn&#39;t (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn&#39;t use proper camera techniques overall in the movie. That&#39;s why it looks sometimes dull and becomes boring almost near the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performances are extremely good from all the five female characters. These women gave strong, intense, but believable performances that demonstrate the actresses&#39; dramatic abilities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The legal concepts helped a lot to understand the plot&#39;s difficulty because the legal term of sodomy is different from a simple raping. From the point of view of Meg&#39;s defense, sodomy needs to be penalized as a raping (a huge crime grade B) although it&#39;s a different crime. Pat and Alex&#39;s defense claims that Meg enjoyed and asked for it. This is where the movie turns interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. The only thing for sure is that the sex scene fits into a legal definition of a crime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch &#34;Jaded&#34; if you like legal issues that aren&#39;t very common in your society. If not, give it a try because it&#39;s a very good and strong drama.

well i wasn&#39;t sure what the film was going to be like as i had only seen a little clip but i was thinking its going to be good and i was right i watched it twice on the day i got it and well it is my favourite film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think Alison Lohan played the part of beth really well she is such a grate actress and the writer must have gone into a lot of research to find out about bulimia although the ending when beth is in the hospital an has 2 Horus observation after meals because iv been told like 1 house is OK and also that hospitals doesn&#39;t help bulimics as iv been told which is probably why I&#39;m still at home even tho my sister and mum would like to have me hospitalised as i to have bulimia but this is a grate film i recommend it to any one with or with out an eating disorder or for people who know some one with eating disorders as it can let them in to the lives of a bulimic person and see the world how they do a bit over all a grate film and i recommend it to any one and any type of person

This film stinks more than limburger cheese! If you find this at a garage sale, LEAVE IT THERE! I love Sandra Bullock and yet HATE THIS MOVIE... Although ashamed, I do own a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that Sandra Bullock is in this at all. They play it up to be &#34;A Sandra Bullock Movie&#34;. She only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that, but she is young and had not learned her talent yet. Well everyone has to start somewhere...

For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I cannot believe what these people did to a perfectly good play. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Let&#39;s start off with the good bit, shall we?-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alan Rickman is alright, although some of his dialog could have been delivered with more feeling. The rest of the actors needed to pull it together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romeo, Romeo, whyfore art thou not dead yet, Romeo? The actor, while not only completely wooden and deadpan, could not read his lines with any gusto at all. He was completely out of focus, had difficulty even looking Juliet in the face, and absolutely NO grace with the lines that he was given. Whoever cast him deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost passable, but she gives no depth to her character,and seems to be completely out of touch with the play. Mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialog. Benvolio was unfeeling and mercilessly choppy with his lines. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was forced to endure this half-baked production of Romeo and Juliet. The acting was stilted and the costumes were nothing short of distracting. I have seen kindergarten puppet shows with more effort put into them. I only wish that i could give this movie a rating of zero.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve yet seen a movie in my whole lifetime about a high school kid creating his own college, just to impress his parents. Nowadays, movies are either remakes or sequels, or plots that have been used in many different films. This one has an original story line and to follow it up by making it a comedy films only lightens the deal. With this well thought out story and with laughs mixed in, this is a good movie. Now I&#39;ve seen better, but upon going into the theater I was thinking another drug/beer/frat party with some sexual innuendo tossed in (aka an &#34;American Pie&#34; flick) but I was surprised. To sum it up, I enjoyed the film and the next time your shuffling through the paper for movies, look for show times to &#34;Accepted&#34;. If you want to laugh out loud, that is.

Batman Mystery of the Batwoman, is, in a word, stale. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot goes that a mysterious female vigilante (&#34;Batwoman&#34;) is intruding on Batman&#39;s turf, and while Batman is trying to combat a Penguin/Bane/Rupert Thorne threesome, he&#39;s trying to figure out who the mysterious Batwoman is. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing strikingly wrong about this, but there is nothing really special about it either, noting really made it stick out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mask of the Phantasm had Bruce&#39;s long lost love re surface and mess with his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subzero was a major event in the life of Mr Freeze. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the Batman Beyond movie spin off, Return of the Joker, dug deep with the characters involved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mystery of the Batwoman had some minor subplots, a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat. Frankly, this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight, lacking the punch and bite that the Animated Series had in it&#39;s prime.

This was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but that&#39;s where it ends. It seemed like a lackluster Set It Off meets The West. The plot barely made any sense. There were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities. There were too may unnecessary things going on that didn&#39;t pertain to the plot nor did it help further the story along. There were also long blank moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The script should have made more sense as well as the directing. I had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie. But the casting was great in my opinion. If you&#39;re only watching for eye candy then this is the movie for you.

Yes, that&#39;s right, it is. I firmly believe that the N64 and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made. It was amazing the first time I saw it, with its huge environments and colorful characters, and its amazing now. The play control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it has that Nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there. A must have for any N64 owner, and a reason to get an N64 for everyone else.

Wish it would be released, as I would love to see the finished product! We saw the unfinished version before it came out. Loved all the characters and actors. Anyone know if it is out on video yet? Would love to see it again.Definitely worth renting if it&#39;s not going to be shown in the theatre. I had a hard time finding it because they renamed it.

Rudolph Maté&#39;s film from 1950 is given a revamp for the 80&#39;s, Dexter Cornell(Dennis Quaid) is a university lecturer who used to have a successful writing career, but thats now gone down the tubes along with his marriage. The initial exposition plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him, so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned, we are not that surprised, unless of course you are familiar with the original. Dexter after being told he has less than 48hrs to live, decides to trace back his steps with the help of one of his students Sydney Fuller(Meg Ryan), but they find they have many obstacles in their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film begins promisingly in black and white, as Dexter staggers in the rain towards the local police station where he wishes to report a murder...his own, but the Huey lewis style 80&#39;s beat that accompanies this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be pretty bad, its only a question of how bad? Sure enough we are soon using the old flashback medium, but now the film resorts to full Technicolor. There are some brief homages to Noir, as the embracing couple stand in front of a venetian blind, but there&#39;s really nothing here to recommend it, the performances are awful, Ryan in particular doing her usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine. The film is a lazy attempt to put some unneeded ooomph into an already fine movie premise, obviously trying to cash in one the Body Heat audience, the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at a teen audience and to be sure, they are welcome to it. 4/10

Not only was this the most expensive Canadian film ever shot in BC, but easily the worst, never seeing the light of day. The director is not even Canadian, but British, and boy does it show. We are all made out to be a bunch of over-sexed dope fiends and morons. The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent, and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk. Of course the British character is normal. The rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype - can you say &#34;Norm!!&#34;? The cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes. The actors always seem to be fidgetting. Are they as bored as the viewer, or is this the directors idea of cinema? Avoid this mess and check out some of Bruce Mcdonalds films. A true Canadian boy with something original to say cinematically. You won&#39;t be compelled to walk out on HIS films after 10 minutes.

This cartoon was strange, but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion to it than other cartoon movies. We have a girl at a camp with low self esteem and hardly any other friends, except a brother and sister who are just a miserable as she is. She reaches the ultimate low point and when the opportunity arises she literally makes a pact with a devil-like demon. I found this film to be very true to life and just when things couldn&#39;t be worse, the girl sees what she&#39;s done, she feels remorse and then changes and then she helps this dark, mystical creature learn the human quality of love. The twins improve too, by helping the little bears and then they get a sense of self worth too. A very positive message for children, though some elements of the film was strange, it was and still is a rather enjoyable film. The music from Stephen Bishop (Tootsie songs) made the film even better

I actually joined this site simply to write in about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. I made it about an hour through before I simply had enough. Curious to see what the general movie-opinionated public thought of this movie, I looked it up on this site. I was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great. I needed to have my say, and here it is: This movie is absolute garbage. It was a chore to sit through. The &#34;jokes&#34; were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and Leguizamo&#39;s manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below. That actually may be a stretch even for that age. I&#39;m all for slapstick ridiculousness, but there isn&#39;t even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. I have an idea, lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. Now that&#39;s funny. Ha. Ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality: The Marx Brothers&#39; A Night at the Opera, Monty Python&#39;s The Meaning of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,...and the list goes on. Don&#39;t lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I can only assume that the reason that David Bar Katz (the other writer) did VERY little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. I&#39;m actually impressed that Leguizamo was able to recover after this mess.

The Unborn is a pretty good low-budget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy. It&#39;s very well acted by the always-good Brooke Adams and b-movie stalwart James Karen, although the supporting cast is pretty average for a b-grader. The music, by Gary Numan of all people, is good too. Henry Dominic&#39;s script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing, although there is a hint of misogyny about it. Rodman Fender&#39;s direction is merely adequate, and there are some unnecessary cheap scares. If you&#39;re a fan of Adams, whose movie career is nowhere near as illustrious as it should be, check it out; she&#39;s great, as always.

I agree with other users comments in that the two main roles were well acted, that being the guy that played Gary Gillmore and Giovanni&#39;s role. Too bad the story was so boring. Not hearing about the story I knew nothing of Gary Gillmore before the movie so I didn&#39;t know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walking or The Chamber but how wrong I was. The whole movie was just talking, talking and talking about their mom and dad. The only cool scenes were the flashbacks where the dad would lose his temper. That was the only interest I got from this borefest.

Lina McLaidlaw is a bright, solitary young women who falls unexpectedly in love with Johnnie Aysgarth, a highly eligible bachelor with a penchant for losing money. They get married, but almost at once Lina is subjected to Johnnie&#39;s addiction to lying, gambling and getting into debt. Despite his flaws, she is unable to resist his charming manner, until she starts to suspect he may be harbouring murderous thoughts toward her ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good movie, well-made, with an attractive cast, a good script and possibly the single lousiest ending in movie history. Okay, that&#39;s maybe going too far, but not by much. Lots of films change the ending of a book (Great Expectations, The Shining, etc) but the last two scenes of this one not only manage to be horribly lame, but also render the entire preceding plot completely meaningless. The story is about a woman whose husband is driven by his greed and moral lacking - and what she knows about him - to kill her. It should end (as it does in Francis Iles / Anthony Berkeley&#39;s book Before The Fact) with him attempting to murder her. The reason it doesn&#39;t is that the studio forced Hitch to reshoot the ending, one of the first examples of the godawful process of preview audience testing. Hitch was canny and did what he was told (this was only his third film in Hollywood) knowing that if he played the game, sooner or later he would gain creative control of his films, evinced by his masterpieces of the fifties. But that still leaves us with a turkey of an ending. This is a great shame because it really is a very good movie with an intriguing theme - does anyone really know their husband or wife that well ? The script is excellent, with many off-guard moments (such as when Lina&#39;s father dies and Johnnie assumes she&#39;s crying about it), a finely-judged performance by Grant (who never played a villain again) and fine photography throughout, culminating in the famous glass-of-milk shot. Fontaine won an Oscar for this performance, although personally I prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her earlier victimised wife role in Rebecca. I would like to rate this movie higher, but I really can&#39;t forgive that ending; this is what happens when movies are made for money, not love, which I guess is curiously the theme of the film itself. Look fast for Hitchcock&#39;s cameo as a man posting a letter.

Okay. To enjoy this silent comedy short you MUST suspend disbelief concerning the major starting point for the film. If you can&#39;t then you&#39;ll probably be more likely to score this film a lot lower. Charlie Chase has a HUGE overbite and his wife has a nose large enough to have its own area code. Unknown to each other, they have both been saving to have surgery to correct these defects. Apparently, plastic and dental surgery was better back in the 1920s because neither seemed to have any need to recuperate from these major surgeries and they looked just dandy right away!! Okay, remember I said to ignore this, right?! Okay, well you also have to then ignore the difficult to believe idea that both could then meet and have no idea the other is their spouse. Okay,...now that you allowed yourself to accept these two silly premises, the film gets really, really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie makes a pass at her and she makes a pass at him. Both are shocked and thrilled because no one has ever really considered them attractive. So, because of this new vanity they agree to go on a date. But, they both sneak back home--not wanting their spouses to know! Anyway, they meet later and are quite attracted to each other. But what about the poor spouses supposedly at home? Well, they both learn that the other is married and both anticipate their marriages will result in divorce because they really want to be with each other! Late in the film, Charlie figures out that the woman really is his wife and he goes through a very funny sequence where he plays both the boyfriend and the old husband--by changing his clothes and putting in false teeth when he plays the hubby! It really is a laugh riot to see him bouncing in and out of the room as he appears to be fighting with another person! You really have to see it to believe it. However, the wife sees an ad with Charlie&#39;s before and after photos and knows what&#39;s happening. In the end, they both feel pretty foolish!

In the unlikely case that some aspiring directors are reading these comments, I&#39;d like to offer some advice (free of charge!), from a viewer&#39;s perspective. If you want to make a serious exotic adventure film, do it. If you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure films, go ahead. DO NOT try to make both at the same time, it doesn&#39;t work. For example, having a goofy &#34;comic relief&#34; character killed and beheaded and following it up with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal&#39;s head just makes you look like you had NO IDEA what kind of movie you wanted to make. This one is boring, meandering, cheap, racist....you get the picture. A couple of smart moments and a few glimpses of nudity from Kathy Shower (way too prissy here) are hardly worth your trouble. There is a reason everyone has forgotten about this film&#39;s existence. (*1/2)

I&#39;m from Ireland and I thought this film had the odd minute or two where accents where a little off but no worse than any Brad Pitt or other American doing the accent. Furthermore, I have rarely seen any British actor handle an American or Canadian accent except for Colin Farrel in Minority Report. This film is a little film and it was entertaining. No it wasn&#39;t a Blockbuster Hollywood production but frankly I&#39;m sick of that shite. I laughed more than a few times and had a good time. It was definitely worth the rental. The main character is a spoof on other hard British gangsters. At least that&#39;s the way I saw it. If you go in expecting a $100 million dollar production you&#39;ll be disappointed. Enjoy it for what it is- a small entertaining film.

Truly this is a &#39;heart-warming&#39; film. It won the George Peobody Award, winning over &#34;Roots&#34;, so that may tell you something of the essence of this film. I am looking on the Internet how to order this movie since my former father-in-law, Eugene Logan, the co-writer of this film has been deceased for a few years now so I no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him. I would love to have his only grand-daughters, my daughters, see this film, as well as to pass this wonderful story on to his great-grandsons. My oldest daughter was seven years old at the time it was aired on television and I since have been looking forward to seeing it again. One of my friends said it was her favorite movie. I won&#39;t &#39;spoil&#39; this movie for you.

Fully deserving its prestigious Hollywood award nomination, this is an entertaining little gem with lots of pizazz and some delightful surprises. Outstandingly funny scenes include an hilarious shoot (and re-shoot) of a WW1 trench scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook as an optimistic non-com and the hapless McDoakes as a Boyer/Colman messenger  all under the beady eye of Ralph Sanford&#39;s delightfully irascible Anguish; a lost McDoakes guided and re-guided by equally perplexed Jack Carson; assistant director Chandler rejoicing in a McDoakes-sent opportunity: &#34;I&#39;m going to be a director!&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ace comic O&#39;Hanlon has a dual role, playing both McDoakes and himself playing McDoakes! Oddly, Richard L. Bare who does play himself in one or more other entries in the series, has turned down that opportunity here. In real life, Bare&#39;s a youngish, six-foot Rock Hudson lookalike, but here he&#39;s impersonated by veteran actor (over 500 movies!), Jack Mower.

&#34;We&#39;re both stumbling around together in this unformed world, whose rules and objectives are largely unknown, seemingly indecipherable or even possibly nonexistent, always on the verge of being killed by forces that we don&#39;t understand.&#34; So says Ted Pikul in the film. Which for some people sums up life and &#39;eXistenZ&#39; probably is a film about existence. What is real and what is unreal and how you tell the difference. Or not. The last line of the film is superbly ambiguous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film seems like a shaggy dog story (indeed it has a real shaggy dog in it) but it takes you along on an interesting ride, full of provocative Cronenberg touches that will make you look at amphibians, game pods, fish, spines and bones in a new light. Some bits are quite icky. It takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called &#39;GAS STATION&#39; and a Chinese restaurant is called &#39;CHINESE RESTAURANT.&#39;The film has an engrossing texture that is leagues away from your usual big budget science fiction movie.You can read many things into the film and it repays watching more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main actors are Jude Law who is OK and Jennifer Jason Leigh who is great. Some roles don&#39;t suit this very talented actor but when she has a good role like this she is unmatchable. Her unconventional beauty and fascinating voice suits the part of Allegra. (Looks great in a short black skirt too.) There are other familiar actors but they are not given much to do. It looks good, sounds good and a Howard Shore score complements the film very well. Cronenberg is possibly the Alfred Hitchcock of the sci-fi/horror genre. No matter what film he makes he is always worth watching.

This a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every level.However if your after the true facts about such legends as Hickcock,Cody and Calamity Jane then look elsewhere, as John Ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legend.The story moves with a cracking pace, and there is some great dialogue between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this movie.The sharp eyed amongst you might just spot Gabby Hayes as an Indian scout, also there is a very young Anthony Quinn making his debut as Cayenne warrior, he actually married one of Demilles daughters in real life.Indeed its Quinns character who informs Cooper of the massacre of Custer told in flash back, the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the American west with American history.So please take time out to watch this classic western.

The topic of religion in Buñuel films is a point that one, as an eater of films, as an eater of art or as a person need to analyze hardly. One can see to a satirical Buñuel in &#34;La Voie Lactée&#34;, &#34;Un Chien Andalou&#34; or in &#34;L&#39;Age d&#39;Or&#34;. Is very hard and effective in its critic, but when you have seen this and then you see a movie like &#34;Nazarin&#34;, after you see this work you begin to be questioned about its author. And much have questioned about what seems to be a contradiction for Buñuel thinks, but is better not called in this way, i think that there&#39;s not any contradiction in its work, only that Buñuel religion point of view is very diverse as unique in films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This beautiful film is based on the novel of Benito Perez Galdós, which told us the story of Father Nazario, who lived a humble, simple life dedicated to God and to help everyone. He lived in a simple and poor region. There lived too Beatriz, who is an abused and abandoned wife. She don&#39;t find any sense of her life without her violent, macho man. She have a kind of repulse to him. In the other side is Andara, one of the towns prostitutes. Father Nazario has been stolen again, he blames to Andara&#39;s cousin. Andara hear this and try to fight without success with the priest, who don&#39;t believe in violence. That night, Andara find that her cousin is actually a thief, she have stole her bellboys. Andara fights with her cousin with terrible consequences. With this, Andara search mercy from the priest. Nazario decides to help her, knowing well that this could be against his church, obviously this thing going to have some consequences. Since here, Nazario going to be a pilgrim. Without nothing, even without shoes, but with spirit and faith. But Andara and Beatriz want to be with he, and be like he, to serve God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If is the sweetest Buñuel film that i have seen so far, is too the most spiritual. Is clear here that the thing that most confuse people with the contradiction is that here, we don&#39;t see a Buñuel against the power of church, we see a Buñuel whose film is about church but not in the typical - and great - satirical way. Whethever like it is, i don&#39;t think that the right word is contradiction, actually i find it pleasant and well done and in spite of contain such religious issues (As his &#34;Voie Lactée&#34;) i found it more a spiritual film but that don&#39;t try to touch in diversity the Catholic religion as maybe he touch, and laugh of it in another films. &#34;Nazarin&#34; is of father Nazario and its perspective front God and the same religion but all of this is at the end, analyzed in the spiritual life of this man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other two women are, not a contrast, but as very well another two perspectives of faith. First we have Beatriz, the mistreated woman, that lose all the faith in life, first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family. This little girl was very sick. At side of her was too Andara, the prostitute who run of the justice. In the family of the child, just religious women, there a big pain, but faith becomes in father Nazario when he arrives with nothing to this town. He bless the child, a say later she is fine. The priest want go on walking, but Beatriz and Andara have recovered the faith in life and want to dedicate their lives to God with father Nazario. After some complains, father Nazario decide to be with them, discovering with some things until the end how he feels about faith, God, religion and the person in necessity, the people who must request to charity to survive. This last issue then must be noted as one possible explanation for the pineapple ending. This ending we listen the drums (Similar to that in &#34;L&#39;Age d&#39;Or) and a father Nazario, walking over asking about this things, when he refuse the fruit at the first time and at the end decide to receive it as a symbol of necessity or maybe, as an answer for its spiritual road that begin being priest. Meanwhile, the two women must take away of the father, Andara for its crime (Beautiful scene where she thanks a man who helps father Nazario in jail and then she damn the man who hit the priest in jail) and Beatriz because she prefer be with her macho man, in spite that he treat her bad, just because she don&#39;t accept that she fall in loved with the priest. Father Nazario - and here is maybe the unique place in film to critic church- walk to contradict the church, the religion that he serves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father Nazario is that then, is a (Soft for much, but not for me) critic for some thing in religion (Father Nazario helping a women who is guilty of a crime, of a sin) but most of all is one of Buñuel analysis of faith and life, and he really got it, with a beautiful, tender, sweet and unforgettable film, that is, without a doubt, one of his best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.

&#34;Nada&#34; was the most inadequate follow-up to &#34;Les NOces Rouges&#34; which,with hindsight,appears now as the last good movie of Chabrol&#39;s golden era (1967-1973) &#34;Nada&#34; is Chabrol&#39;s first real attempt at a wholly political movie;its previous work &#34;les Noces Rouges&#34; had also political elements but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in French provinces.&#34;Nada&#34; includes terrorists,ambassador,hostage-taking,a lot of blood,not really Chabrol&#39;s field.A heterogeneous cast gives the movie the coup de grâce :only Duchaussoy,who had already played with the director ,and Maurice Garrel are up to scratch.Viviane Romance ,one of Duvivier&#39;s actresses (&#34;la Belle Equipe&#34; &#34;Panique&#34;) ,is wasted as a madam (Gabrielle).Italian actors (Fabio Testi,Lou Castel)are awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &#34;Nada&#34; this a second period of barren inspiration for Chabrol .It would be &#34;Violette Nozières&#34; before he was again at the top of his game.

The Long Kiss Goodnight has just about everything action fans want: a witty screenplay by the guy who wrote Lethal Weapon, Samuel L. Jackson, and great action set pieces by Renny Harlin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously underrated. One of the best action movies ever.

Soul&#39;s Midnight stars Armande Assante (Simon) who stared in &#34;The Mambo Kings&#34; and Elizabeth Bennett (Alicia Milford). Together with Sexy vampire vixen, Lucila Sola (Iris), Simon lures pregnant Alicia and her husband Charles into the netherworld of Soul&#39;s Midnight. Assante sinks his fangs into the script by writers Brian and Jason Cleveland and you enjoy watching him and Iris kill. Alicia and Charles (Robert Floyd) try to stay alive while gore keeps your lust for blood sated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(spoiler alert) In today&#39;s jaded landscape, it comes as no surprise that a back-stabbing preacher gets bitten. Set looks cool  lots of detail at the Borgo Hotel and cool special effects at the end. I had a lot of fun watching this movie  it doesn&#39;t take itself too seriously and looks great.

Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-running internet only fan film, done completely for the love of the series, and a must watch for fans of Trek. The production quality is extremely high for a fan film, although sometimes you can tell that they&#39;re green-screenin&#39; it. This doesn&#39;t take away from the overall experience however. The CGI ships are fantastic, as well as the space battle scenes... On the negative side, I could tell in the earlier episodes (and even occasionally in the newer ones) that some of the actors/actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles, but once again, this doesn&#39;t take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of Star Trek. The cast and crew have truly come up with something special here, and, as a whole,I would highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.

I was wrapped to see many other people also enjoyed this film. First watched it when I was in my early teens and then again several times late at night a few times after. Then sadly, no more. I&#39;m now nearly 49 and so wish it could be made available on DVD. Why not? The best Anthony Quinn role, no one could have been more suited for the part or parts he plays - I&#39;ve mentioned it to other film buffs of similar age and alas, no one I know recalls it. As the daughter of a generation that went through WWII and its aftermath (and myself deeply fascinated by what that generation endured) I guess this film at the time gave me a wonderful cinematic insight into some of the heartbreaking issues of the day. For classic final scenes this movie is a stand out.

I&#39;m a fan of Jeff Bridges so I snapped this up on DVD without having seen it previously. I instantly became a fan of Kevin Spacey, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general plot of &#34;alien in human body&#34; has, in my experience, been done to death, but I liked the approach taken in K-PAX, which struck me as quite different and much more sensitive than most. Bridges makes an excellent doctor (you *want* to tell him what&#39;s on your mind) and Spacey&#39;s expressions and gestures are perfect in the role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interaction between Prot and the entirely human characters in the clinic is delightful, particularly the subtle manipulation of their behaviour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is bittersweet - I like Prot&#39;s choice, but the final scenes (with Bridges) made me teary.

This has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns I have ever seen. Having a soft spot for the genre (westerns are  or were, since they are no longer made very often  morality plays that too often have been denigrated by critics with intellectual pretensions), I purchased the DVD, sight unseen, because I had read enough about William S. Hart&#39;s work (much of which he wrote and directed) to pique my interest and thought I should have at least one of his films in my video collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that I approached the actual viewing with some trepidation. My previous experiences with silent cinema &#34;classics&#34; had left me feeling let down. Chaney&#39;s The Phantom of the Opera, Griffith&#39;s Birth of a Nation and Fairbanks&#39; The Mark of Zorro were fine, but not nearly as good as their reputations would lead one to expect. They were either too long, or too theatrical, or both. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Toll Gate, however, emerged as a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a story told in a simple and straightforward manner. Black Deering (played by Hart), leader of a notoriously successful outlaw gang, thinks the time has come for group to disband, before its luck runs out. He is, however, opposed by his chief lieutenant, Jordan, who goads them all into one last holdup by promising great wealth but leads them into a trap in which he is complicit. Everyone is killed except Deering, who is taken prisoner. When his captors recognize him as the man who once saved a number of soldiers and settlers by warning an outpost of an impending Indian attack, they allow him to escape. Free, he tries to find honest work but is snubbed and ridiculed and ultimately must rob again to survive. Soon, he is pursued not only by the sheriff&#39;s posse but also by Jordan (now prospering from the reward money he has collected) and his henchmen. His flight leads him to a remote cabin inhabited by a single mother and her little son. After some initial misgivings, they take him into their hearts. Deering sees a chance for a new life but, with the posse and Jordan closing in, realizes that this may not be possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hart was the first great western star and the first to inject realism into the genre. As one of the pioneers of movie-making, he created many of the characters and situations that have become cliché in westerns for more than ninety years. What keeps his movies interesting, however, was his ability to go beyond the cliché (perhaps his imitators did not go far enough) so that the material appears fresh and innovative, even now. Three such instances in The Toll Gate illustrate this: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) In one scene, his character shoots into a crowd in an attempt to kill Jordan, and kills a bystander instead. A subsequent close-up shows that he is clearly frustrated. The frustration, however, comes not from the fact that he has gunned down a man who had hitherto caused him no harm but that he missed his intended target. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) In another, as he flees from the posse, his &#34;borrowed&#34; horse steps into a gopher hole and breaks a leg. Hart pulls out his gun to put the animal out of its misery but, before pulling the trigger, gives his head a sad, loving pat, as if to say farewell to an old friend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) And finally, after he has strangled Jordan and thrown his body over a cliff, he returns to retrieve his guns and spots his adversary&#39;s pistol lying on the ground nearby. He steps forward and gives it a swift kick before mounting his horse. It is a simple gesture but it underscores the deep loathing he feels for the man who betrayed him and his comrades. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I love the title, The Toll Gate. It is allegorical in its implication that a man cannot begin a new life until he has paid for the sins of his old one. Deering&#39;s payment comes in the form of sacrifice. Today&#39;s more sophisticated audiences may not buy into that sentiment entirely but it can still work on you if you let it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewers who like their videos in pristine condition will undoubtedly object to the DVD&#39;s picture quality, especially the badly deteriorated final reel. I don&#39;t mind at all. That a copy of this 1920 movie even exists at all is a miracle since prints of so many other silent movies have been lost. If you bear that in mind and look upon the film as a piece of history, its visual flaws are not that difficult to accept. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William S. Hart was born in 1870 in New York but grew up in the Minnesota and Wisconsin where he learned to speak Sioux and Indian sign language. He counted Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson among his friends and collected Remington paintings, so his knowledge of the West was first-hand. If his vision seems overly romanticized by today&#39;s standards, it is nevertheless rooted far closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the &#39;60s and &#39;70s and the revisionist works that followed. Both the star and his films are overdue for re-evaluation.

&#34;Live Together, Die Alone&#34; is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island &amp; the Swan station itself and honestly moving. Desmond and Penny seem magically connected to each other, even when they are on opposite ends of the world, and both characters are beautifully acted (it&#39;s hard not to cry when Desmond reads Penny&#39;s letter). The action inside the hatch is edge-of-your-seat tense, as Locke is determined not to allow the button to get pushed again, convinced it was all just a psychological experiment, Desmond gradually realizes the consequences of this decision, and Eko is locked outside and tries desperately to get back in. The melting of the clock and Locke&#39;s &#34;I was wrong&#34; are unforgettable moments. The outside action has Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley captured by the Others due to Michael&#39;s betrayal (after they make a puzzling discovery connected to the Pearl), and &#34;Henry Gale&#34;&#39;s game-changing return as the Others&#39; leader. Even the least important plot line, Sayid, Jin and Sun sailing to the beach where the Others are supposedly camping, contains one of the greatest mythological mysteries of the show, the giant statue that&#39;s almost entirely missing except for a foot with four toes. In short: emotion + history + mythology + adventure + suspense + the threat of annihilation + a ray of hope = a classic LOST episode. ***1/2 out of 4.

I went into Deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while that&#39;s something like what this film is; I also can&#39;t help but think that it&#39;s just a poor man&#39;s Sleuth. The classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of the plot, but certainly it&#39;s the case with the execution. The casting of Michael Caine in the central role just confirms it. The film is based on a play by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary&#39;s Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him. After his latest play bombs, Sidney finds himself at a low; and this is not helped when a play named Deathtrap; written by an amateur he taught, arrives on his doorstep. Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney soon begins hatching a plot of his own; which involves inviting round the amateur scribe, killing him, and then passing Deathtrap off as his own work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all of its clever twists and turns; Deathtrap falls down on one primary element, and that&#39;s the characters. The film fails to provide a single likable character, and it&#39;s very hard to care about the story when you&#39;re not rooting for any of the players. This is not helped by the acting. Michael Caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect, but nobody else does themselves proud. Christopher Reeve is awkward in his role, while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance. It&#39;s lucky then that the story is good; and it is just about good enough to save the film. The plot features plenty of twists and turns; some work better than others, but there&#39;s always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting. Director Sidney Lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus. The central location is interesting in its own right, and the cinematography fits the film well. Overall, I have to admit that I did enjoy this film; but it could have been much, much better.

As I was watching this film on video last night, I kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure. I&#39;ve a feeling I&#39;ll be watching this again and again for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story/film. And even though some cultural references are obscure for me, a Western viewer, at the core this is a universal tale.

The fluttering of butterfly wings in the Atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow related to the Chaos Theory, I&#39;m not sure exactly how), every action, no matter how small or insignificant, will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events. This small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly-unrelated characters, most of them in Paris, whose actions will affect each others&#39; lives. (The six-degrees-of-separation theory can be applied as well.) Each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film. The acting is finely-tuned and nuanced (Audrey Tautou is luminous), the stories mesh plausibly, the humor is just right, and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement.

If You can watch a film without worrying about the plot, or corny acting, then Backdraft is definitely the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if, like me, you like watching films that you can believe, then Backdraft has some serious flaws. It doesn&#39;t offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90&#39;s action films that follow identical formulas, whilst not being quite as clunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two firefights, i&#39;m thinking, this has got to go somewhere else, i mean, how many big fires are there in one city? Surely firemen do other things, such as getting cats out of trees? Well I was wrong, and the repetition continues again and again, up until the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good aspect of the film is the fire itself, well filmed, and I must say i felt quite hot while watching it, which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste.

SPOILERS ALERT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important film from my life because it&#39;s the first film I remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4-year old scamp. The story is based on the Sheila Burnford novel, and is a reason why it&#39;s not possible to write this one off as a brainless Lassie clone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic story: Two dogs and a cat happily live in the Seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children, gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner San Francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months. The bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong, and Shadow the golden retriever and Sassy the Himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are, though the young and happy-go-lucky American Bulldog known as Chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical (due in part to his voice-over explaining his being abandoned as a pup, picked up to an animal shelter, and being bought by the family), though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness (fantastic wilderness settings by the way), driven on by Shadow&#39;s instincts of direction. They meet several perils along the way, hoping to make it home, while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance. There are funny moments all the way through, great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes), and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling, punctuated by moments of sadness (such as when Sassy&#39;s arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall, leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow though, I fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take. Somehow, it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg, finds it hard to get out and gives up, exhausted, followed by Chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out, telling him how important he is to him and how he&#39;s pushed them this far so he shouldn&#39;t throw it all away so easily. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way that this scene (brilliantly done) isn&#39;t concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home, but Shadow is nowhere to be seen. Then just as all seems lost, he slowly appears, and is reunited with the family. Chance&#39;s conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey, and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there, leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown, but also how the other two have as well. Hang on a second, I think I&#39;m going to cry...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I haven&#39;t read Sheila Burnford&#39;s book, so I don&#39;t pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie. But this is a film that all the family can watch, and while the tots will love the talking animals, older viewers will understand the plot line better (as I found when I watched the film again after several years without seeing it). This film is a masterpiece in cinema, and I suggest that if you haven&#39;t seen it you go out and get it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And please avoid the sequel (see my review for Homeward Bound II!)

Critics claim that this film is one of the worst films ever. Watchers also claim the same. But there is a flip side to that coin. They are wrong, very wrong. It&#39;s the most clever film I&#39;ve seen in ages...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From beginning till end you see a story thats unrealistic. A story that reflexes the real world. This film is like a mirror. You see yourself in another way that people see you. To really understand the directors point of view, you have to see it another time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you see this film...Try to understand the story (and watch the background)...Listen to the lyrics of the music...And smell the industrial complexes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is one of a kind. You&#39;ll hate it(most people do), or you&#39;ll love it(and understand it completely)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ernest Hemmingway once said:&#39;the world is a fine place, and worth fighting for&#39;. I agree with the second part.

&#39;Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul&#39; is one of the best music documentaries that I have seen lately and is more than a film about music. It is also a musical love declaration about a fabulous city, one of the greatest city in Europe and the world, one of the most important cities for Europe history and for Islam, the city that may bridge in the future Europe and the Middle East or may signify once again, as is already happened in history the precipice between two worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the music. The interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music, and we hear a lot of (good) rock and rap in the first third of the film. An then, like a backwards move in time the soundtrack takes us to the roots, to Turkish traditional music, to commercial romances, and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of Turkish music. In such a complex and conflict ridden country as Turkey is the film does not avoid some of the political aspects, like censorship introduced by the military rule in the 80s or the relevance of the songs of the minorities especially the Kurdish one. One of the best musical moments is actually provided by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a cathedral-shaped hamam (Turkish bath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One gets to love the city and its music by the end of the viewing and hearing of this film. I have never been to Istanbul but after having seen this film I am sure that I want to visit this place soon.

If you like Gary Cooper, this is one of his best roles. His gentle intensity to right a wrong is what made his career. &#34;Blayde Hollister&#34; comes to Dallas to take revenge against Will and Brian Malowe, who burned his Georgia farm and killed his family. Inept Marshall gets in Hollister&#39;s way, attempting to arrest him when interrupted by a street shootout between Hollister and Wild Bill Hickock. The shootout is staged to get the law off Hollister, &amp; he takes the &#34;back East&#34; Marshall under his wing to keep him alive in Texas, as they switch identity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was a great beginning, and the picture holds up all the way through. Action may be a little &#34;slow&#34; by today&#39;s standards, but it is one of my top 10 favorite movies.

What attracts a man to military service? What prepares a man to survive brutal torture as a prisoner of war? What desperation leads to the planning and execution of an escape into the jungles of southeast Asia? How does he cope with the ghosts and memories he returns home with? Herzog tries to answer these questions in his documentary of Dieter Dengler, German emigre and U.S. Navy pilot shot down over Laos in 1966, who was taken prisoner, tortured and starved, but ultimately escaped to be haunted by the experience for the rest of his life. A powerful and personal first-hand account of the man, his life and experience recounted through the seemless integration of interviews, archival footage and new footage. You will never forget this story--or this man.

Its obvious ESPN drools whenever Knight is in the news, but did they have to make a freakin&#39; movie about him? This was THE worst attempt at a serious dramatic movie I have EVER seen. It had it all: terrible acting, terrible dialogue, ridiculous casting, cheap sets, etc etc. It looked like it was shot on a $10 budget. Cummon, whats up with the game scenes? Were they in a middle school gym? And the lighting, well, let me just say it was ridiculous. And Brian Denehy as Bob Knight? Give me a break. Denehey looked like...Denehy in a red sweater, nothing more. ESPN lost a lot of credibility with this flop attempt. They poured millions of $$$ in advertising, then the premier was a huge dissapointment. Bob Knight is not a subject that can be covered in a 2-hour movie. ESPN blew it. Even Knight himself thought it was more stupid than anything else.

If they gave out awards for the most depraved and messed-up movies in the world, Japanese cinema would clean up: their exploitation cinema wipes the floor with most other contenders, the most extreme examples being absolutely jaw-dropping exercises in bad taste, nauseating gore, freakish weirdness, and misogynistic sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guts of a Beauty is a prime example of such whacked out filth, offering discerning viewers just over an hour of full-on debauchery and gratuitous violence topped off with some very insane J-splatter goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film opens with a young woman named Yoshimi, whose search for her missing sister has led her into the hands of some nasty yakuza, who proceed to rape her and shoot her full of strong dope called Angel Rain. After the gangsters have finished having their fun with the poor woman, she manages to escape and flees to a nearby hospital where sexy psychologist Hiromi (Megumi Ozawa) attempts to help. However, the distraught and confused Yoshimi ends up throwing herself off the hospital roof, turning into a water melon as she hits the ground (at least that what it looked like to me!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeking to avenge Yoshimi&#39;s death, Hiromi lures Higashi, a member of the yakuza, to her office, and, whilst jacking him off, hypnotises him into attacking his fellow gang members. After Higashi goes slash happy with a knife in the yakuza HQ, he is severely beaten and stabbed, forced to tell of his meeting with Hiromi, and then hacked into itty bitty pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The psychologist is then captured by the gang, subjected to a spot of forced buggery (whilst simultaneously being forced to give head to a yakuza slut), and injected with Angel Rainafter which she promptly carks it. The gangsters then plonk her body in the boot of their car, along with the remains of Higashi, ready for disposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before they can ditch the corpses, however, the super dope has an unexpected effect on Hiromi: she returns from the dead as a hermaphroditic monster with a toothy penis and a ravenous gash, and, hellbent on revenge, sets about killing the yakuza one-by-one; this leads to some memorable scenes of outrageously gory splatter, including a messy head squish, a man being suffocated by the monster&#39;s oozing vagina, and a woman being screwed to death by its giant, gnashing phallus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can most likely tell from the above synopsis, this is some crazy, screwed up stuff, and probably not to the taste of most sane people, but for those weirdos who have long tired of mainstream cinema and are already well versed in Asian excess, Guts Of A Beauty should prove to be delightfully diverting and deviant fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

I&#39;ve never watched a file in a language I don&#39;t understand just because I wanted to see the movie and I couldn&#39;t find it with English subs. I don&#39;t know how much I missed but it wasn&#39;t much. Probably just specific details which sounds silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together. I want to mention to The Diceman from Germany there&#39;s no reason to feel that he &#39;sucks&#39; when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. Like I said, I don&#39;t understand Japanese -or at least only the very small amount I came away with from reading the very lengthy novel -pro- bably my favorite all time book which I could not put down &amp; took the next day off from work just to finish reading! I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s an English dubbed or subbed version but if the film but if there is I&#39;d love to see it. The film was incredible in Japanese anything better is icing of the cake!!

Having majored in Western History when I was a student in college seeing the views on World War II are quite discomforting and in a whole completely wrong. World War II was the most graphic and bloody affairs to ever occur in world history. While the Axis Powers conducted many crimes against humanity which is still the view today and the correct many people forget that not every German soldier was out to exterminate the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier swung a samurai sword around and flew kamikaze missions, and not every Italian soldier was a Fascist. Most of these soldiers for the Axis powers were normal people like you and I caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for a country they loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Battle of Stalingrad was arguably the most lethal battles in world history with over 1,500,000 casualties sustained over the course of the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader Lieutenant von Witzland as they are reassigned to the Eastern Front to battle the Soviets at Stalingrad. Von Witzland acts as sort of the main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They all are normal men and seem to be completely unaware to what is happening back in Germany and Poland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film follows the course of the battle. The film is overall very bleak when it comes to its portrayal of combat and a soldiers life during the battle. We are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the battles (including a firing squad sequence). Overall the battles are the earliest examples that I know of that portray the loss of limbs and overall in your face death sequences and violence. Much of the inspiration for Saving Private Ryan&#39;s battle sequences seem to have come from this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film does not aim to make the German&#39;s completely innocent of everything in the film. Several of the higher ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are use to, evil. Most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home. The film makes it clear quite quickly that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and army was entirely oblivious to the fact that genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers in the Germany Army was simply fighting for a cause they really didn&#39;t understand and most wished just to return home rather than freezing in negative degree temperatures in Russia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film really shows how hellish war is, especially World War II. The battle scenes will shock you with its gritty realism and the story is quite easy to follow as you are simply following a platoon during the battle. As with most war films do not expect much happiness after seeing it. It will leave you in a bit of a depressed mood just from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the Eastern Front faced. Not recommended for children. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 stars

Only on a very rare occasion does an episode of the x-files fail to generate any excitement or does the episode contain anything which is just totally boring to watch.A detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances.The deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths took place.Mulder has devised a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has come back reincarnated as the little girl and is exacting revenge.Now for the bizarre bit.The little girl has no connection at all and seems to just a random person chosen as the reincarnation.I think this was slightly lazy writing by the writers and this episode ranks as one of the worst in x-files history!

Probably the best film of the year for me. This small French film centers on put upon office secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) who spends her days doing other men&#39;s jobs, uncredited, and being the source of their scorn and lunchtime conversation which is all too clear to her as, being partially deaf, she reads lips. A change is set in motion when she hires newly paroled con Paul (Vincent Cassel) as her assistant. The relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film. Mutual dependency, for vastly different reasons, bonds them. Carla becomes attracted to Paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive for,what seems like,the first time. Paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help. He owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him which will involve Carlas&#39; skill of reading lips. I think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspense/drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the whole film, no matter what other characters are on screen, you can feel this amazing bond between Carla and Paul. I cannot remember when I have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a brilliant performance (she won the French Cesar for best actress). You never feel like you are watching a piece of acting, this really is Carla. The chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful. He makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive. I loved this film because of these two people, and both times when I had finished watching it I wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again.

I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film. Like other neo-Biblical films of the 1940&#39;s and 50s, &#34;The Egyptian&#34; reflects the morals and values of that time, but is still great entertainment because the performances are terrific and the story so well told.

There&#39;s perhaps a special reason why The Fox and the Child hit a special note in my heart. Having just said goodbye to my new fiancée - of oh...one day - for an unknown period of time, I was a bit overwhelmed with varying emotions and was suffering the fallout from putting on the brave face she needed to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched a few movies and TV shows, but my interest darted from what I was leaving behind to what is out there and what I haven&#39;t seen. For that, I have this movie to thank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a nature lover and having heard about the film beforehand, I was sure I was going to like it anyway. But I didn&#39;t just like it, I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technical mastery is astounding. How did they do it? How did they capture the animals in the way they did?? It&#39;s just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moral of the tale is a good one and while the ending is oh so French and ambiguous, it&#39;s a happy/sad one. Again, it caught me a bit off-guard. As a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself, the ending was tough going while on a plane full of people I would be seeing for the next 15 or so hours! Perhaps it&#39;s because the ending made me think back to what I left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for those few hours on the plane, I was happy to see something new and original. And that&#39;s life. Sure, there are those things you love and feel comfortable around...but the great outdoors holds many a mystery. So the next time I see something out of the ordinary while out in the open; I&#39;m going to explore it, observe it and embrace it. That&#39;s precisely what happens in this movie and that&#39;s precisely what you should do with this darn good movie/nature doc too. 8/10 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It&#39;s two months on from the plane journey. We still don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll see each other again, but we will.

Well its about time. I had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season&#39;s entries. While there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries, at least this episode turned out well. Its rather funny that director Rob Schmidt who only has the not bad Wrong Turn to his credit and writer John Esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season. In &#34;Right To Die&#34; we are treated to the story of Cliff and Abbey. At the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation. Abbey has caught Cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back. While they speak, they find themselves in a car accident where Cliff is left with only scratches and bruises, but Abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire. And this is just the setup people. Once in the hospital Cliff must decide whether or not Abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes. There&#39;s also a side effect too. Every time she flatlines, Abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people. Hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever. From the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists I never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it, Right To Die should have the right to go on living forever.

Only saw this movie late last night. I remember the hype of it&#39;s release and to be honest had I viewed it back then I maybe wouldn&#39;t have been so generous. I hate hype, it can ruin a movie. I think the movie glossed over the characters and put too much emphasis on Woody. He was good too - although kept wondering if he was stoned the whole time. It never went too deep. Redford was dark but not too dark and his character let me down in the end. To me he should have been more confrontational with Demi - throwing her out perhaps or telling her that she was paid for. After all he would have investigated them before he made the proposal - that&#39;s not shown in the movie, but no one in his perceived position would have made an offer to just anyone. He was cruel to the point of breaking them up and the last straw was the house and yet Demi fell for him? The passages giving an insight to Demi and Woody&#39;s relationship were the best part of the movie. There was a keen deepness that outshone the shallowness of John Gages character. He really could have been a lot stronger and as other people have alluded I think the movies draw-card was Redford and they didn&#39;t want tarnish his &#34;image&#34;. I say what the hell Robert was old in this movie! Woody and Demi&#39;s characters were naive in a sense, but I think that was very intentional to draw you to their plight and champion their decision. But the reality is, they were losing their dream home and where did they go? Las Vegas? to gamble what little they had left and then accept a proposal from an insanely rich billionaire. I found their naivety when Redford was seducing them a little too unrealistic. The movie could have been so much more and other actors would have made a difference, but having said that on late night TV - it was enjoyable and I if you don&#39;t think too much - also palatable

A beautifully constructed and brilliantly acted comedy. There is not a person in the cast who does not acquit himself (or herself) with hilarious distinction. However, the real star of the film is the unseen director, Frank Oz, who brings all the madcap sensibility and wit to this farce that he brought to Miss Piggy&#39;s encounters with Kermit the frog. This is a not -to-be-missed film.

I am terribly sorry, I know that Faßbinder still is called one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered &#34;master-pieces&#34;, but when I see &#34;Lili Marleen&#34; today, in 2004, I wonder what everyone is up and away about this movie! The acting is simply terrible - Hanna Schygulla is all the smiling like an idiot! -, the changings between Nazi-glamour and battlefields are ridiculous, the whole film looks as if it was made within two days in an attic. Probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to take this for &#34;real art&#34;, but for me this movie is simply bad &amp; cheap. Compare this to Viscontis &#34;La Caduta degli Dei&#34; and tell me again that &#34;Lili Marleen&#34; is a good movie...

In a really neat spin on Hitchcock, Larry (Billy Crystal) and Owen (Danny DeVito) lead unpleasant lives: Larry&#39;s ex-wife has gotten rich by publishing a book that he wrote, and Owen has the most overbearing mother imaginable. When Larry tells Owen to calm down by watching &#34;Strangers on a Train&#34;, Owen gets the idea that they should do criss-cross murders like in the movie. And just like in the movie, Larry thinks that it&#39;s a joke, but Owen&#39;s serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How they came up with the idea for &#34;Throw Momma from the Train&#34; I&#39;ll never know, but it&#39;s a hilarious movie. There isn&#39;t a dull moment in it. And that ending was a hoot. Crystal and DeVito are at their best, and Anne Ramsey is as much of a hag here as she was in &#34;The Goonies&#34;. A modern classic.

&#34;House of Dracula&#34; is a good sequel to &#34;House of Frankenstein&#34;. There isn&#39;t as much action but the acting is just as good. Onslow Stevens is the benevolent Doctor who turns bad after receiving blood from Dracula via a transfusion(Dracula was actually receiving the transfusion to overcome his &#34;affliction&#34; but he puts a spell on a hunchback nurse and then transfuses his blood into the Doctor.). It turns out that Dracula really didn&#39;t come to seek a cure but instead drain blood from a beautiful nurse. Dracula is destroyed and the Wolf Man is next in line for a cure(which is successful). In the meantime, Frankenstein&#39;s monster is discovered and revived briefly before burning to death(don&#39;t worry, the same trio came back in &#34;Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein&#34;). John Carradine again plays a sinister Dracula(Baron Latos is his alias at the start of the film and in &#34;House of Frankenstein&#34;). Lon Chaney is the sympathetic Wolf Man and Glenn Strange returns as the Frankenstein monster. Lionel Atwill again plays an inspector, which he often does in the Universal Studios monster films. A keeper for your collection.

There are few films that deal with things that I would consider myself an expert on, this one is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some years of Fantasy Role Playing we split, me not leaving without a sense of shame of what I had become: a dork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, these things are really canonical, it happens to everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you create a character fairly and it dies after the first attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you help a little with the constitution, and while you&#39;re at it, why not help with strength, intelligence, intuition, charisma and dexterity too? This in turn frustrates the game master who doesn&#39;t know how to deal with this invincible gang. And after a while it bores the players too, so they start to create ever more exotic race-profession combinations, no matter how ludicrous it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I created a Druedain warrior monk, yeah, not that far from the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#39;s not all to be said about the destructiveness of the inherent dynamic of this devilish game (think the hunt for experience points), but just watch the film, it shows it all - and of course the stupidity of its most basic premisses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this end, in turn, there is no better profession than the bard. I don&#39;t exactly understand why the bard became a character in the first place, after all, the blacksmith is none. But once it became one, it had to be mapped into the game flow, that is: it had to be made lethal, at least indirectly. The poking of fun out of this never comes to an end and rightfully so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it&#39;s not exactly a professional production, but I haven&#39;t seen a better satire in ages.

No redeeming features, this film is rubbish. Its jokes don&#39;t begin to be funny. The humour for children is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package. Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next. I couldn&#39;t enjoy the film at all. Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike with Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc. which all get frequent requests for replays.

Tremendous fun both as a film and as an excuse to sit back and play the &#39;oh, that&#39;s whassis name&#39; game. Every star of the golden age of English films seems to be in this one and it was a joy to see them. And the greatest of them all, Richard Wattis, was as tremendous as ever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is actually a plot that trundles along very nicely, there&#39;s also some splendid jokes and comedic moments, but the key to this films triumph is the characters within it. Alastair Sim is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a six foot, big-boned Scotsman could be the headmistress of a girl&#39;s boarding school. George Cole, Beryl Reid and Irene Handl all have their moments but, with Alastair and Richard, the star of the show is Joyce Grenfell. She is an absolute one-off and brings a smile whenever she&#39;s on the screen...her rolling-walk and plum accent done to perfection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those playing the , that&#39;s whassis name&#39; game, you can even spot Arthur Mullard, Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle if you look carefully.

I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico, and I ended up watching one about Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I fail to see the 50% that live in poverty. When I do see struggling people, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans, or Cubans that have recently arrived to the island. There is no such thing as spanglish... either you speak Spanish, or you don&#39;t.... and from what I heard... you don&#39;t. Pedro Albizo Campos IS NOT MLK to me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man to those that want independence which is 1%. To the rest he as loco as Osama Bin Laden. Puertoricans that want independence are a bunch of fools. If you want any proof to all of you dreamers of an independent Puerto Rico see Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, all of South and Central America, and Mexico. Its worked wonders for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about the Nuyoricans and their struggles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the person that complaint that not enough of Africa was on the show... it was suppose to be about Puerto Rico... not Africa. Denzel will make one shortly just for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion... to all those ignorant white people that think we need green cards to come to the US, and want to learn how the prime minister runs things, this is not a good documentary about Puertorican culture. Tell your kids to pay attention in Geography, and History class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bocabonita... &#34;doc.&#34; was about Nuyoricans. She promoted it as if its how we all feel. Should have been titled... &#34;yo soy nuyorican... lunche...can&#39;t speak Spanish.&#34; PLEASE STOP USING PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA, OR ANYTHING ELSE ASSOCIATED WITH PR WITH THIS NUYORICAN HISTORICAL LESSON. God forbid they play this on the island.

This film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably. The misfits pull together to successfully complete their mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilarity ensues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the &#34;Police Academy&#34; films, the humor comes from the kooky characters on the boat. I thought it was an engaging film and I will stop to watch it anytime it is on TV. No, it won&#39;t cause you to ponder your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of mankind, but it is fun enough entertainment for 90-some-odd minutes. Plus, Lauren Holly looks hot in a naval uniform.

So well done. The photography, sound, music and the performances were the best. It&#39;s also an amusing story line that brings a smile to your face with each scene--I loved it and I&#39;m a 60 year old heterosexual guy. Each character seemed to fit their part to a tee. It&#39;s the best performance that I&#39;ve seen from Ms. Capshaw--she&#39;s been in more movies than I thought, but this was a wonderful achievement. I suppose it&#39;s a plus to have Spielberg money behind you allowing for a fat budget and all the best that money can buy technically. Two of the cast have successful T.V. shows of their own now--it&#39;s easy to see why. Tom Selleck does his usual good job.

Arthur Miller certainly knows. His stories give a clearer picture of what it means to live in the United States in the 20th century than any other writer I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Focus, based on one of his novels, is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William H. Macy and Laura Dern give fantastic performances here. Emotionally bruising but ultimately rewarding, this movie is excellent.

I&#39;ve seen this movie more than once. It isn&#39;t the greatest scifi flick I&#39;ve every seen, but it is not a bad movie. The acting is good and the characters are more &#34;real&#34; than most in low budget sci fi. (At least it isn&#39;t full of dumb bimbos like so many other low budget scifi.) I especially like Elizabeth Pena. She is a good actress and she does worried single mother as well as any and better than some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t let the nay sayers run you off. See it for yourself and judge it for yourself.

Season after season, the players or characters in this show appear to be people who you&#39;d absolutely love to hate. Is this show rigged to be that or were they chosen for the same? Each episode vilifies one single person specifically and he ends up getting killed off. You enjoy seeing them get screwed although its totally wrong and sick. You enjoy seeing them screwing others, getting screwed themselves, playing dirty, getting it back, escaping and finally getting kicked out by Trump. The amount of tears also seems to be increasing by the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rewards which attempt to compensate for past humiliation and suffering are also heavily reduced. In the newer seasons, its like &#34;You get to meet xyx who&#39;ll lecture you about uvw&#34;..like who freaking cares? The characters are so hateable, collectively and individually, that you wonder if they&#39;re paid actors? The only sane one gets to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch with caution and maintain a conscience. Those are your fellow human beings in the firing line.

Routine suspense yarn about a sociopath (Dillon) who gives his sperm to a clinic of human reproduction and starts to harrass the lives of the woman (Antony) and his husband (Mancuso). Extremely predictable, far-fetched and with undecided tone all the way. Don&#39;t lose your time with this one...make a baby instead!

I am rating this an 8 because of the premise of the film. The acting was fine, there wasn&#39;t anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling. It is disturbingly true that intelligent people are having less and less children, or choose to have none at all...whereas dumb ass &#34;W in &#39;04&#34; supporters are procreating like rabbits. And, though I don&#39;t believe the earth will actually exist in 500 years, I can see Mike Judge&#39;s parodied prophet coming to be, as life imitating art. The world is being run by idiots, and it will get worse as the intelligent free-thinking people become the minority and the &#34;git &#39;er done&#34; fans outnumber them. The proof is our farce of an election.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I digress. If you are fortunate enough to have this playing in your city, go see it. I have paid my $7.50 plus popcorn to see FAR WORSE rubbish than this (Date Movie or Napoleon Dynamite anyone?). There are laughs, there are cringes, but overall this is entertaining. If you have half a brain, you will think to yourself how this movie, though funny, is spot on (accurate) and a *tiny* bit uncanny. I&#39;m not surprised AT ALL that this movie is almost completely unknown, as Fox was the one distributing this, and they wouldn&#39;t want any of their sheep to see this and think &#34;maybe I WILL read a book, and not watch &#39;Next&#39;, or &#39;Cheaters&#39;, or &#39;Ow my balls&#39;.&#34; If our society doesn&#39;t stop the dumbing down of everything,and the bastardisation of the English language (ahem, Mr. Bush), then this really is where we are going.

Like with any movie genre, there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies. If you asked me to name a good gangster movie, I&#39;d have dozens to choose from. If you asked me to name a bad gangster movie, probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since I saw the film for the first and I promise you, the last time. That film is &#34;The General&#34;, unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name. This is a very dry, very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story (it&#39;s more than easy to follow) but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like &#34;Goodfellas&#34; (1990) and &#34;American Gangster&#34; (2007)two superior mob movies&#34;The General&#34; is based on real people and true events. The film revolves around an Irish criminal named Martin Cahill (Brendan Gleeson) who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult. Meanwhile, the police led by an inspector named Kenny (Jon Voight) try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict (or kill) him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps because it&#39;s a film in the same category as the marvelous &#34;Goodfellas&#34; (1990) and the first two &#34;Godfather&#34; films, I was expecting too much from &#34;The General.&#34; But that may be going too easy on it. This would have been a bad film had I not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its far-too-stretched running time of screaming bad scenes. Let&#39;s start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented. For some reason, director John Boorman and cinematographer Seamus Deasy selected to film this movie in black-and-white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full-fledged color film. Now I have nothing against b/w pictures, not even ones made in modern-day times. &#34;Schindler&#39;s List&#34; (1993) was more than ninety percent filmed in black-and-white and it&#39;s a masterpiece. &#34;The General&#34;, made just five years after &#34;Schindler&#39;s List&#34; is not. The cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video-game-like quality that I found simply annoying. The filmmakers were obviously going for a realist&#39;s documentary-like style, like &#34;Schindler&#39;s List&#34; did, but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time, too much like a classic-style motion picture. Performances in the film range from passable to poor. Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles, but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting. The sound design is also very primitive, probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crime-noir appeal, but that also fails because again, it&#39;s made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the worst thing that occurs is that there&#39;s not onenot onecharacter in the film that I felt any emotions or opinions for. In fact, for every moment of every scene, the only thought going through my head was &#34;okayso what?&#34; Moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time-consuming here. I did not sympathize or hate the Brendan Gleeson character because the way the Cahill character is written is simply flat and dull. Gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real Martin Cahill obviously did. If a character is killed off (as they always are in gangster films), we feel nothing. No remorse, no relief, no surprise, nothing. We just say &#34;so what?&#34; And that&#39;s all I did during the entire running time of this very flimsy, very poorly-made crime film.

I watched the McCoys reunion and was glad to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez!!!To see them now was wonderful, because I always watched the show growing up so when the TV said that there was going to be a reunion I was so excited !!!! The only thing I could not figure out is why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman(little Luke) was not on there.I know that Walter Brennan had died. So I got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to Lydia Reed( Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke I would be thankful!!! I have searched everywere and no luck .The only thing I could find out about Michael Winkelman is he was supposed to be born in 1946. This show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learned.The shows today dont have that.The whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them So since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do!!! Thank You Glenda

Joseph Conrad&#39;s timeless novel, Heart of Darkness, was depicted in the 1994 movie. I have read Conrad&#39;s novel, and I must say, even though I prefer the novel itself, the movie was a great depiction. The set and costume designs brought Conrad&#39;s novel to life on the screen as we followed Marlow&#39;s journey. The acting also brought the characters to life through the mannerisms, voices, and personalities. If you have read the novel, I recommend that you also view this movie. If you have not read the novel, however, the movie may be harder to follow. Conrad&#39;s Heart of Darkness is too full of action, emotion, and information to be made into a movie that is a little over an hour and a half long. Therefore, if you have not read the novel, the plot in the movie may seem too cluttered to follow. Overall I gave this movie a seven out of ten. The basic plot of the novel was brought forth to the screen with great sets, costumes, and acting. Nothing can replace Joseph Conrad&#39;s original work however.

This first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they weren&#39;t very funny and had a drama element where Bill (the mother) was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element was a bit depressing and didn&#39;t mix well with th comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped. After that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the BBC have ever made! The chemistry between Bill and Ben&#39;s character&#39;s were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series. The Christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for Christmas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show came to a stop when the main actor Gary Olsen playing Bill passed away which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films such as Up &#39;n&#39; Under and a very funny man RIP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesn&#39;t to be repeated that often - Though it does appear on UKTV Gold once in a while but it should be repeated on BBC one or two to show this brilliant Comedy to a new audience

While I rather enjoyed this movie, I&#39;ll tell you right now that my mother wouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s out there. Really warped little dark comedy that reads like a fairy tale gone awry. &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neat treat with all the cameos too. If you want something &#34;different&#34;, look no further.

A £3.50 DVD can be a gamble and this was one that sort of paid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent Saturday Night type movie that entertains if you gloss over the obvious plot flaws. Special effects are a bit few and far between with some repetition (and why does London always look as if it&#39;s in the 60&#39;s ?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it had the budget of, say, Armageddon then I&#39;m sure it would have performed better at the Box Office as the story is quite a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Tycus is consigned to B movie history but if you see it for £3.50 then it&#39;s worth buying.

LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake -- wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And he&#39;s the star? I should have known better than to rent EDISON FORCE. In fact, I did know better. But in a moment of absolute weakness, I rented this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV, you know it&#39;s one of two things: an indie or a dog. As in sat-on-a-shelf. Which this did. And with good reason. The plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la MAGNUM FORCE, and &#34;journalist&#34; Timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them. He is targeted for his efforts -- or maybe I should say for his horrible acting. I turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing. Just awful. The real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard, looking like nothing so much as a hobo. You just know the director was not in control. Freeman is clearly slumming.

I felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this film&#39;s page because some of it was slightly misinformative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally I posted quotes from the original poster, but I wasn&#39;t sure if it was proper given that this is the &#34;comments&#34; index and not a message board (though we used to use &#39;em that way back before IMDb added the film message boards) so I will edit this to make it unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, first of all you may not be aware of this, but Gene Kelly first became famous for playing &#34;Pal Joey&#34; on Broadway in the original production. When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a Gershwin &#34;panorama&#34; film, he wanted Kelly&#39;s character to be more sophisticated than the &#34;goody two shoes&#34; roles he had been playing in most his films (with the exception of &#34;For Me and My Gal&#34;). Alan Jay Lerner was instructed to construct a new story set in Paris based on the story of &#34;Pal Joey&#34;. This gave Kelly a chance to play his famous role from Broadway even though Warners had outbid MGM for the rights to &#34;Pal Joey.&#34; In my opinion, the WB film &#34;Pal Joey&#34; is a wreck, though Sinatra was suitable for the role, but other problems sunk the film (script changes and poor direction. ===================================================&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You complain that Kelly&#39;s pictures are not well done, even citing your art education to prove the point. But you miss the fact that Kelly&#39;s bad art was clearly designed to be bad, and it is necessary for the story/characters. The pictures are so bad, the audience knows that Kelly isn&#39;t ready for an exhibition. Even he knows it, though Milo has sort of sugared him up to the point where he almost believes her. But it&#39;s important that the audience not be sitting there saying &#34;but, he&#39;s a great artist, if he only had the chance!&#34;. You want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you complain that he sabotages his interest in the show; again you are not understanding the structure of the story. He refuses because he doesn&#39;t want to feel like a gigolo, and because he knows he&#39;s not really ready for the exhibition. His enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as &#34;Joey&#39;s&#34; enthusiasm to &#34;start a nightclub&#34;. But it serves the same function in the plot. Remember, it&#39;s essential in &#34;Pal Joey&#34; (the play) that Joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes that he doesn&#39;t deserve it. Same with the art show. If Kelly&#39;s paintings were actually good, it would undermine this whole point. ===================================================&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you complain that Caron and Kelly have no &#34;chemistry&#34;. I guess it&#39;s in the eye of the beholder. I agree, the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but for me it was fine. Compare it to even worse &#34;forced&#34; romances like the one between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in &#34;The Pride and the Passion&#34;. ====================================================&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this film, it just shows that you haven&#39;t dug beneath the surface of the film into its symbolism. Many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and characters, and through the dance the plot is resolved through images and symbolism. It&#39;s about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (he looks around and his love is gone). The movements of the symphony are constructed so that part of each dance scene mirrors a separate phase of Parisian Art and also a separate phase of their relationships. If you didn&#39;t&#39; see that, it&#39;s not the movie&#39;s fault. It&#39;s certainly not a &#34;load of crap&#34;. ==================================================

Two hard-luck but crafty ladies decide to act like HAVANA WIDOWS by sailing to Cuba to meet &amp; blackmail rich gentlemen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the sort of ephemeral comic frippery which the studios produced quite effortlessly during the 1930&#39;s. Well made &amp; highly enjoyable, Depression audiences couldn&#39;t seem to get enough of these popular, funny photo dramas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joan Blondell &amp; Glenda Farrell are perfectly cast as the frantic, fast-talking females who will go to great lengths to make a little dishonest dough. Although Joan gets both top billing and the romantic scenes, both gals are as talented &amp; watchable as they are gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handsome Lyle Talbot plays Joan&#39;s persistent suitor, but he&#39;s given relatively little to do. Chubby, cherubic Guy Kibbee appears as the girls&#39; intended target. Whether awakening to find himself in the wrong bed or being chased across the roof of a Cuban hacienda in his long johns, he is equally hilarious. Behind him comes a rank of character actors - Allen Jenkins, Frank McHugh, Ruth Donnelly, Hobart Cavanaugh, Maude Eburne, Dewey Robinson - all equally adept at pleasing the toughest crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited James Murray as the suspicious bank teller with the forged check. This very talented actor was pulled out of complete obscurity to star in King Vidor&#39;s THE CROWD (1928), one of the silent era&#39;s most prestigious films. Hopes were high for a great career, but his celebrity faded quickly with sound pictures. After a long string of tiny roles &amp; bit parts, broke &amp; destitute, his life ended in the waters of a New York river in 1936. He was only 35 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While never stars of the first rank, Joan Blondell (1906-1979) &amp; Glenda Farrell (1904-1971) enlivened scores of films at Warner Bros. throughout the 1930&#39;s, especially the eight in which they appeared together. Whether playing gold diggers or working girls, reporters or secretaries, these blonde &amp; brassy ladies were very nearly always a match for whatever leading man was lucky enough to share equal billing alongside them. With a wisecrack or a glance, their characters showed they were ready to take on the world - and any man in it. Never as wickedly brazen as Paramount&#39;s Mae West, you always had the feeling that, tough as they were, Blondell &amp; Farrell used their toughness to defend vulnerable hearts ready to break over the right guy. While many performances from seven decades ago can look campy or contrived today, these two lovely ladies are still spirited &amp; sassy.

This movie is amazing! While being funny and entertaining, it is also profoundly deep and eye-opening. I will watch it again and again. Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life. He has a job and a life, but it isn&#39;t what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, unsatisfied, and resentful that his life isn&#39;t the way he envisions it should be. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life. God comes to Bruce and grants him Godly powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted. His life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy.....with one exception. In the process of gaining everything, he loses the one person who truly loved him. As the movie unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what was truly there. This movie was inspirational and deep. If you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize. As my wife says, &#34;Since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy?&#34; and my humble addition, &#34;May we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out.&#34;

This movie is apparently intended for a young, evangelical Christian audience as a teaching tool. For that I give it a 7 out of 10 point vote. It&#39;s a decent movie to show a youth group, but I don&#39;t think it will be very well received beyond that. For any other audience, I&#39;d rate it lots lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviewers that saw &#34;It&#39;s a Wonderful Life&#34; in this were right on, though I didn&#39;t think of that until they mentioned it. I was more reminded of a &#34;Chick Tract&#34;, those little 3&#34; by 5&#34; gospel comic books. If Jack Chick ever made a movie out of one of his tracts, it would probably look a lot like &#34;Second Glance.&#34; It has a strong Christian message about the power of prayer and the influence each of us has on earth, but it is somewhat hampered by Christian stereotypes. The Christians are all very nice, somewhat passive, and squeaky clean, while all of the non-Christians seem to be bad people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muriel the angel plays a major part, and he is the corniest, cheesiest character in the film. He is the most unlikeable angel I have ever seen in any movie, and the biggest negative. I don&#39;t know if the directors intended for his personality to come off so badly, or if he just struck me that way. (I admit that he reminded me of someone I know.) Dan&#39;s love for a very worldly girl who is not at all his type drives the plot in this movie. Why he ever fell for her in the first place is the one question that I wish had been answered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the movie does display positive Christian values, and your youth group will be entertained as they view something wholesome with a good lesson.

What is it about certain films that generates such polar opposite reactions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people here have called High Roller &#34;disgusting.&#34; Some have called it &#34;extraordinary&#34; (as would I, actually).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? I think it&#39;s because films like this don&#39;t make heroes out of jerks, or glamour out of degeneration, and some people just can&#39;t deal with that emotionally. They NEED a hero. And I&#39;d also add that if they&#39;re gamblers or poker players, they might feel personally betrayed when their existence isn&#39;t justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High Roller in NOT a poker movie. It&#39;s a PEOPLE movie. It&#39;s not perfect, but it looks good, is well-written, and wonderfully acted. And best of all, it generates an emotional response and inspires reflection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And maybe that&#39;s what makes some people so damn mad.

Why aren&#39;t more films (especially American) more like Meatball Machine? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first official on-line review and I am charged with &#34;electrical ecstasy&#34; after having chosen &#34;Meatball Machine&#34; as my first endeavor. This is a review, so I&#39;ll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, this is one creative piece of work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic TETSUO! So what if it&#39;s not all original? I own both of these films and though Tetsuo is one strange son of a bitch, Meatball Machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify film significance. Meatball Machine is as elaborate in it&#39;s story as it is in its high influx of blood and gore. Thank you Jesus for Japanese Cinema!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, the last time my dreams were overrun by visions of horror happened after watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 7 or so. I could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a telephone for weeks on end. This time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this film human bodies are host to Aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending quench for human flesh and blood. Humans become flesh eating cyborgs!!! There&#39;s more!!! Fight scenes!! Great Music!! Great point-of-view shots! Decent acting by the woman Cyborg (at least better than her male counterpart). The fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and did I forget to mention it&#39;s a Love story! Wow, I hate love stories but this takes the cake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t wait to have friends over to watch this film once more just to see the reaction on their faces. Sadly, I took time to write this review because I&#39;m afraid most friends and family wont understand Meatball Machine. The truth is America as a whole is not prepared for Meatball Machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, My wife walked in while I was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless. Normally she says something like &#34;why are you watching that junk?&#34; This time she had nothing to say. I was glad! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not junk. This isn&#39;t just SPLATTER (splatter for the sake of splatter is also great). This is Art my friends. Art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHACHO

This has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen. The giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre. This unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story. The casts is outstanding, including TOM BOSLEY who as far as I know never has been in a horror movie before, ever. The effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one. My one complaint, I just wish we saw more of the giant mummy, but other then that I think they did a great job. The dialog, the characters and the story was perfect. The acting was wonderful. This has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel. You heard me, the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel. I give THE FALLEN ONES 9 OUT OF 10.

Dreamgirls, despite its fistful of Tony wins in an incredibly weak year on Broadway, has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals. However, that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on-screen. Unfortunately, what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact. First, the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor. There are lots of songs (perhaps too many?), but few of them are especially memorable. The closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and One Night Only - the much acclaimed And I Am Telling You That I Am Not Going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of Effie (Jennifer Hudson). The film is slick and technically well-produced, but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance. There is some interest in the opening moments, watching Jamie Foxx&#39;s Svengali-like manager manipulate his acts to the top, but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film, when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain, despite his having been right from a business stand-point for a good majority of the film. Beyonce Knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well, but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz. Anika Noni Rose as the third member of the Dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film. Eddie Murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on James Brown, but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact. Foxx would seem ideal casting, but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored. The film&#39;s biggest selling point is surely former American Idol contestant/Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson in the central role of Effie White, the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return. For me, Effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie. The film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather ham-handedly takes her side, but I have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion. From the start, Effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious, egotistical, self-centered diva, who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part. When she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude, the charges are more than well-founded, but the stage show/film seem to think Effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice. Even though the film tries to soften some of Effie&#39;s harder edges to make her more likable, the charges still stand. Her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter - using the implication that (much like the talent card) motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable. Indeed the only big effort the film makes to show Effie&#39;s mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office, insists that the girl has &#34;no father&#34; and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows. In the hands of a skillful actress, the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma. Unfortunately, Hudson is not that actress. She sings well, but the dialog-driven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments. Effie&#39;s signature moment (the aforementioned And I Am Telling You... number) is well-sung by Hudson, but emotionally flat in the acting department. Effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament, but Hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number. All in all, not quite the emotional highlight one expects. The latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver Foxx into Hudson&#39;s earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone. Foxx&#39;s criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers, but the film&#39;s seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous, not to mention pretentious and condescending, particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle. The end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit, drained of emotion, energy or anything that can be described as dynamic.

&#34;Back in the Day&#34; is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher&#39;s daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he&#39;s trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone. He brings a lot of energy and menace into the role. Joe Morton as the preacher is his usual excellent self, but he doesn&#39;t do much. The same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as Reggie&#39;s Dad. He needed more screen time. I don&#39;t want to say this, but Pam Grier is pretty awful as Mrs. Cooper. She overacts every scene and brings the movie down. Tia Carrere and Frank Langella are in it but don&#39;t do anything substantial for the plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end: You should see it for the skilled performances of Ving Rhames and Joe Morton and the grittiness of the writing and directing.

This is definitely one of the weirder 70&#39;s movies out there, and it&#39;s most notable for kicking off a decade of Bigfoot hysteria. It is also notable for the little touches of insanity throughout the movie, especially when the dark, moody first half is replaced by a MUSICAL INTERLUDE of all things (as another user pointed out, one of the songs is dedicated to a character, Travis Crabtree, who paddles around in a canoe for a while, then... leaves, never to be seen again). Although it&#39;s painfully dated now, i&#39;s still a fun scary movie to show to kids, and anyone who enjoys either Bigfoot lore or 70&#39;s hillbilly culture is bound to get a kick out of this. My favorite part: a guy gets so scared that he jumps headfirst through a door (!?) and the narrator explains he went unconscious from &#34;shock.&#34; Uh, I&#39;d say breaking a door with his head is more likely why he went unconscious, but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you like bad Americana.

i´ve seen this piece of perfection :-) during the fantasy filmfest in berlin and when i went out of the cinema i felt like being &#34;drugged down&#34;! i´ve seen a lot of films but there are just a few that i´d call perfect like koyaanisqatsi or fight club-subconscious cruelty is definitely one of them!!! half of the people went out of the screening in berlin and i can understand them absolutely! this is not a movie for &#34;normal&#34; people with dreams and illusions! a person that is living in his/her dreams day by day not wanting to see all the horror in our life and on our planet will be very shocked by this film! if someone reads this now who has seen s.c. and also thinks it´s great: just contact me-so far i haven´t met anyone who shares my opinion-it´d be cool!!! this film earns 10 points out of 10!!! finally i´m really sorry for my bad english-i´m not a studied person!!! (und das ist auch gut so *g*)

This is a lovely tale of guilt-driven obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matiss, on a lonely night stroll in Riga (?) passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. He passes by without a word. Only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act. And then only too little and too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman. On a troll of local bars, he finds her pocketbook. He pieces more and more of her life together. His &#34;look&#34; changes as his obsession grows. He has to make things right. In a marvelously filmed dialog with the &#34;bastard ex-boyfriend&#34; he forces Alexej to face up to the guilt that both feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunting long takes, a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt, barking dogs. Footsteps. Lovely film noir with a lovely twist. A good Indie ending.

I waited almost 25 years to see this movie, thinking it might be an underrated work, from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been. It starred one of the best film villains of all time, was based on a beloved series of children&#39;s books, and was a Disney Studios production. What could possibly be wrong with it? As it turns outs, almost everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not everything. Vincent Price as Rattigan and Henry Mancini&#39;s swanky score are the movie&#39;s two saving graces. Price is wickedly enjoyable, and Mancini more professional than the material deserves. They bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile the rest of the movie, while filled with inappropriately adult situations, still suffers from a completely dull script, blandly generic voice work, terrible songs, and lazy animation that wouldn&#39;t have been out of place on any of Disney&#39;s mid-1980s Saturday morning TV shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a complete disappointment to me. It&#39;s amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with The Secret of NIMH. Costing a fraction of this, an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than GMD has in its endless running time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra star that keeps this from being &#34;awful&#34; goes to Price and Mancini.

This is what happens when you try to adapt a play from the theater. Look at the end of the picture, totally theatrical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a reminiscent of Les liaisons dangereuses the final steam-less speech try to make us think that the whole (and deep) theme of this matter was the manhood. Who cares by this point? It was about manipulation. And so the audience feels after this movie has ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young directors: A play is told with the words more than actions. A film is the opposite most of the times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#39;m not talking about the gay theme, overly exploited without a point (&#39;cause there&#39;s no explanation of this topic considering the so called &#34;philosophic&#34; or presumptuous basis) to the level that this film should have been called Grand Gay

I love most movies and I&#39;m a big fan of Sean Bean so I thought that I would at least LIKE this movie. Also, I&#39;m Canadian and this is a mostly-Canadian movie so I was prepared to cut it some serious slack. Nothing could have prepared me for the garbage that is &#34;Airborne&#34;. Steve Guttenberg as an action hero? Give me a break. The acting throughout the movie was so bad I am going to have trouble sleeping tonight. I now have only two wishes in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I hope that you never have to sit through this movie. 2. I wish I could get those 6 hours back. Oh wait, the movie&#39;s under 2 hours - it only seemed like 6 hours...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t watch this. Seriously.

The subsequent two seasons of this original series was less than lacklustre. The latter seasons disastrous reshuffle contributed to its three season short life span. Maybe if the plug was pulled after the first season it would&#39;ve gained a cult following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, the first season was truly hilarious! Witty, clever with superb writing it was promising. The first season&#39;s excellent brew had the right ingredients - characters/actors, storyline and so forth. Plus a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original to boot. Nora and her fellow &#34;photographers&#34; on the prowl, night after night, day after day for the exclusives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of things don&#39;t make sense to me. Like how this show, and another fav of mine - Gross Pointe never &#34;made it&#34;. If only the first seasons of the Naked Truth, and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD, please anyone out there?!

Curiously, Season 6 of the Columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts, based on this outing for the &#34;man-in-the-mac&#34; and also &#34;Fade into Murder&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, it is not a coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts (incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material. The story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Columbo is also shadowed by a colleague here(similar to &#34;Last Salute to the Commodore&#34;) but the entertainment value is minimal. To add to this, Celeste&#39;s Holm characterisation, which is intended to provide comedy, induces embarrassment rather than laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift Columbo the case, though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, what turns out to be, arguably, Columbo&#39;s worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series. He quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircut/manicure at the same time. The next 5 minutes are hilarious - it&#39;s just that Columbo&#39;s hair is so perfectly groomed, then he can&#39;t afford to pay the bill and then, when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstyle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Columbo completionists only.

This one is one of those classic B movie following the exploits of 2 hobos. It&#39;s done really cheesily and Big Stupid running off one-liners like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene he&#39;s in as the creepazoid Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dad&#39;s voice going up 10 octaves (&#34;You loved her?&#34;). Danny, Big Stupid&#39;s protege, is surprisingly stupider, but not as loathsome as our lead star. There&#39;s also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner. Joyce Meadows is the sweet, naive nice gal and probably the least annoying. And those yellow ruffles (RAWR!). Oh, and booze is evil according to Mr. Stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie&#39;s a hoot. Watch the MST cover of this and Crow&#39;s terrific Elam homage!

It&#39;s not just that the movie is lame. It&#39;s more than that. This movie is just unnecessary. Do we need another Western? How about a western with afro-Americans in the titles roles? Sound stupid, implausible and a lame attempt at modernizing the genre? It is. Incredibly lame and simple minded. It&#39;s like that lame Baz Luhrman film &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34; where he set it in modern times to attract young folks and create some hype with his revamping of a classic tale. Well, Baz Luhrman failed miserably and so does this mess. The story is actually not bad however the whole idea of removing the racism out of a racist genre by casting an all afro-American cast is racist in itself. It&#39;s also puerile and simple minded (like Baz Luhrman-man he&#39;s a bad director). Hey (I hear you say) this was directed by Mario Van Peebles! He&#39;s also IN the film! How can it be racist? It&#39;s not. I said the idea of casting all afro-Americans instead of Caucasians was. The film isn&#39;t racist, it&#39;s just pointless, stupid and very very boring.

George Armstrong Custer is known through history as an inept General who led his rgiment to their death at the battle of Little Big Horn. &#34;They Died with their boots on,&#34; paints a different picture of General Custer. In this movie he is portrayed as a Flamboyant soldier whose mistakes, and misdeeds are mostly ue to his love for adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Errol Flynn plays George Armstrong Custer who we first meet as an over confident recruit at West Point. Custer quickily distinguishes himself from other cadets as beeing a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. Somehow this never appears to bother Custer and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such predicaments. In spite of his poor standing, he eventualy graduates and becomes an officer in the United States Army. Through an error, Custer receives a promotion in rank. Before this can be corrected, he leads a Union regiment into battle against the Confederates. His campaign is successful and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero. Custer returns to his hometown, marries his sweetheart, Libby who is played by Olivia De Havilland. Libby is a very supportive understanding wife who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes leadership of the Seventh Regiment of the Cavalry. Custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the Native Americans. To prove his intentions, he enters into a treaty with Crazy Horse, the leader of the Sioux . When that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the Black Hills, Custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Errol Flynn dominates each scene in which he appears. He successfully portrays Custer as being flamboyant, arrogant, romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene. Olivia De Havilland&#39;s depiction of Libby Bacon Custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender, more gentle side. The Chemistry between DeHavilland and Flynn, who had acted together in several other movies, is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of Custer and his wife. The other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of Flynn and De Havilland. Anthony Quinn as Crazy Horse, Sidney Greenstreet as General Winfield Scott , Arthur Kennedy as Edward Sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviewer would rate this a 4 star movie. While it is not historically accurate, it is very entertaining. The movie has a little bit of everything. It has adventure, comedy and romance, so it appeals to a large variety of audiences. The casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact. The reviewer especially likes that the Native Americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

What impressed me the most about &#34;One True Thing&#34; was how up-front it was when the daughter mentions her mother&#39;s cancer at the beginning of the movie. As depressing the subject matter was, it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blindsided with the revelation about a character&#39;s fatal illness 2/3 into the movie (&#34;Love Story&#34; &#34;Terms of Endearment&#34;, etc.). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William Hurt give very strong performances that don&#39;t go over the edge. The characters they play seem human; they&#39;re not perfect people. (Arguably, one might not say that about the &#34;Martha Stewart&#34;-type character Streep plays but throughout the film, I found her character to be noble in a non-sappy way. She&#39;s dealing with her plight the best way she knows how.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;One True Thing&#34; is an observant, unsentimental family drama in which the tears at the end were well-earned.

What makes this one better than most &#34;movie movies&#34; is that it doesn&#39;t feel phony. The film the story of the hot-headed director and his rise and fall and rise, by using real recognizable names and events during the silent and early sound eras. Instead of the generic &#34;sound will put us out of business&#34; business, they actually SHOW Jolson and &#34;The Jazz Singer&#34;. The acting is really quite good, with believeable performances from Don Ameche, Alice Faye and J. Edward Bromberg in particular.

Wesley Snipes is James Dial, an assassin for hire, agent of the CIA and pure bad-ass special operative. During his free time Dial dons a cowboy hat and breeds horses with macho names such as Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter agent Collins, his supervising officer. Enter a new assignment - kill a terrorist that is in UK custody. Of course the United Kingdom being an allied state is a great place for covert ops and head-shots outside of courtrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The assassination is a big success apart from the fact, that the escape plan blew. So Dial&#39;s partner and local liaison gets killed in action trying to escape the police, whilst Dial becomes hot property with the London coppers trying to get to him and CIA trying to dispose of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately for Dial the safe-house is routinely visited by a teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who loves hanging out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil UK law enforcement...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a script like that need I say more? On the plus side Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (be that a pro or a con) and the movie is quite engaging. On the minus editing is very disjointing and has a hurl effect on the stomach.

As well as being a portrayal of a lesbian love story, FIRE is also a comic satire of middle-class (?) Indian culture. I find this is a quality which is little appreciated about the movie. These two genres (i.e. deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do, but Mehta (somehow) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection. The servant Jatin&#39;s behaviour, the family&#39;s treatment of him, the bedridden grandmother&#39;s constant inescapable presence, Ashok&#39;s obsession with a swami&#39;s teachings: coming from a culture much like India&#39;s, these are things I can immediately identify as being typical. They have been crying out to be pointed out and ridiculed. While developing her primary subject matter, Mehta manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully. In fact, much of the humour in the film which provides essential relief from the heavy subjects of taboo lesbian love and gender issues, stem from this satire of the seemingly ordinary. The film flows from the comic to the serious with great subtelty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, brilliant use of symbolic devices (Radha compared to Sita of legend and coming out of Fire unscathed and, therefore pure; the lifelong desire of the young Radha to see the ocean finally achieved when she gains freedom). Kudos to Shabana Azmi(Radha), the lighting crew and Deepa Mehta; their very un-Hollywood-like (and un-Bollywood-like!) talents made this movie special. One criticism: the first scenes seemed rather disjointed to me in that they did not flow into each other very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict: 9 on 10. Nothing less for a movie with scenes so burned on my mind.

This was the worst film i have seen for a long time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that it has nearly nothing to do with the other American Pie movies, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not funny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girls are nice though, but spending your time watching a cheap soft porno would possibly be greater than watching this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film seems to be a very bad made sex ad, made for an audience that is not older than 12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never visited an American college, but i would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh about any of the scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your time, do something else.

Lost holds something interesting for everyone. You can say an awfully lot about this series, and an awfully lot has been said, so I won&#39;t be the one to spell it all out for you again. Just read the persons who loved it, and you&#39;ll know why you want to watch it. The nice thing about this series is that its totally new. There are not much movies -and even fewer- series based on the theme of only suspense, but Lost lives up to the theme with pride. Its all about the unexplained and if you combine that with an exotic location, nice plot twists, an excellent cast and a good format (present and past combined in single episodes) you&#39;ll have a series in which every episode is a story on its own but part of a greater telling. You want to have all the insights of the characters, you want to see the overall picture and you&#39;ll want to know where the writers are taking you. The result of that is that its a series which does not let you go. On a more sceptic note, the series went under a bit in season 2, probably due to its own success. It is well known that Lost was only written for one season originally and when the overwhelming success followed, the writers were overwhelmed too. In my opinion they made the mistake to add even more mysteries and in a higher pace in season 2, then to solve the ones (or partially at least) the ones of season 1. At the end of season 2 you ended with a big blurr of secrets, plot twists and unexplained phenomena, but there is only so much a viewer can take. The difference between season 2 and 3 however was huge. Season 3 handed out a lot of insights, to partially replace them with new questions. And that&#39;s exactly how they should write; you want to thumble from one plot twist to the next, not get a tsunami of secrets spread all over you and then pick up a few to explain to the viewers. They got that in season 3 and brings us a promising series future for season 4. Its good to see that such a different format of a series, can be so hugely popular.

Alice enters in a world of wonder... but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a kid. The Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, the Queen and others (even Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alice some things about her body -- and other people&#39;s bodies -- that might be quite wonderful. A tale of love and lust the likes you&#39;ve never seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristine DeBell appears as Alice. I must say, by 1970s standards, this may be the most attractive adult actress of her day. I believe this is her only film before moving on to mainstream work, but it was pretty much the best possible one she could have chosen (my love for all things Alice is no secret). Even better than &#34;Fairy Tales&#34; (which isn&#39;t really pornography, so, much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The songs are cheesy, but fit the theme of the movie. One song, &#34;What&#39;s a Girl Like You Doing on a Knight Like This?&#34; was pretty funny, and the others had similar themes going. The trial towards the end was well scripted, and fit very nicely into the world of Alice. The logic and humor were definitely accounted for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can you say about a film like this? All I know is, for people who are used to adult films where it&#39;s just a 30-second lead-in to the sex, this one is going to overload you with plot and music. But, personally, I think there&#39;s something very special about this film and I hope it gets a nice DVD release with things touched up and special features (if that&#39;s even possible). I can see this being a cult film.

I feel like I&#39;ve been had, the con is on, don&#39;t fall for it. After reading glowing reviews (the Director was a film reviewer with Sky for years so must have a lot of mates in the press ready to do him a favour by writing favorable reviews) I expected solid acting, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, an intriguing plot development and poetic moments. Sadly, &#39;Sixteen years of Alcohol&#39;, doesn&#39;t deliver on the critics promises, for the most part, sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects (what was that clichéd cobweb scene in there for?), unrealistic fight choreography and mindless mind numbing narration, cliché edits and camera angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Sixteen years of Alcohol&#39; starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in Scotland, but it&#39;s straight downhill from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending some time building atmosphere, creating characters we might care about, or building suspense - the director opts to begin driving you crazy with self indulgent heavy handed twaddle voice-over&#39;s. The lead characters are so unsympathetic and are so badly acted - the audience doesn&#39;t care what happens to them, desperate Actors do desperate things...like this movie!. To make matters worse, the &#39;homage&#39;s&#39; (typical of a director trying to pay his dues to past masters) are either utterly cliché or unconvincing. The soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me and kept me in the cinema but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative other connecting a period of time to the action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason the movie got increasingly flawed and to be quite honest annoying. I still watched the whole damn thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I liked the attempt at gritty realism in the film but even that was destroyed when they were often inter-cut with weird and abstract, sometimes pointless scenes. You don&#39;t need a huge budget to make truly moving film, so much has been said about how little money they had to make this film, half a million is not a little bit of money...SO NO EXCUSES! Sometimes I wonder what the actors...Or their agents were thinking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pass on this turkey unless you&#39;re masochistic or mindless anyway....NOT MY THING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.5/10

Am an ardent Vijay fan. I have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has all the regular clichés that one can expect from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is bad in studies but a star in his forte i.e.Kabbadi. His friends to fill in the comedy quota. A heroine in a life-and-death situation. A villain, which I say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. High octane chase and action sequences. Music that can make one dance. And above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director doesn&#39;t give any chance for the audience to loosen up. He just goes on from one nail on the head to the next. And one can see the lighter side of Vijay in this film which he rarely executes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All said.....This movie was and will be perfect for many years to come....

This wasn&#39;t really a very good movie. There were lots of implausible and predictable things that happened during the course of the film...but I think that most of the reviewers are missing the point of why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience. THIS MOVIE WAS PRODUCED BY MAGIC JOHNSON! Isn&#39;t that enough to inspire us all to check out this film? A film produced by a former NBA star doesn&#39;t come along every day, you know. Beautifully stupid kids in a big house getting slashed by an axe wielding psycho. Every cliché trotted out for us to groan over. Teen sex. And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can&#39;t say enough about this movie! Teen drug use! College hijinx! And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!

What can I say about THE PLEASURE PLANET that I haven`t said about umpteen other tedious soft core porn films ? Very little . It`s just another movie with a very weak plot used to set up very unconvincing set scenes between male non actors who spend too much time in the gym and bimbos who have obviously had silicon implants . Actually the sex scenes in this movie are somewhat less convincing than you usually see in this type of film as the cast members grind their hips together giving pained expressions like they`ve got constipation or something . No wonder a lot of people claim sex is over rated , they`ve probably watched too many of these films on late night cable stations

Like I said its a hidden surprise. It well written well acted and well cast. I liked everything in this movie. Look its Hollywood all right but the brighter side. Angelina Jolie is great in this and I&#39;m totally watching every movie with her in that I can get my hands on. Well worth a look.

I went into this movie determined to like it. I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc...I went into this movie thinking I would be on the edge of my seat. Plus, I am a big Pacino fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a piece of garbage. Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen in five years. This makes Pacino&#39;s debacle in Any Given Sunday actually look good. First, half the movie is watching Matthew McConaughey lift weights. OK, we get it. You are in shape Matt. We don&#39;t need to see every other scene with you pumping iron, shirtless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, how many plot holes are in this movie? Why introduce the phone call from Brandon&#39;s long lost Dad and never address it again? What was the point of his Mom hanging up on him - why even have her call to say he is sending her too much money - what was the point of that? The guy from Puerto Rico who lost 30 million? Also, since sports betting is illegal in NY, and its acknowledged its illegal, how can they possibly guarantee everyone&#39;s bet at the end? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was simply a very poorly written script. It had potential, but it was devoid of a coherent plot. I thought Pacino learned his lesson about script selection after Any Given Sunday, but apparently not. My Gosh, this is the same actor that starred in the Godfather! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t waste your money.

This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: Do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly... whoah! You&#39;re a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And surprisingly all the other smart people are losers. They don&#39;t know anything and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult but still these professors can analyse the results in less than 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every movie has something good in it anyway and Robin Williams is it in this one.

This is breezy highly entertaining drama with an excellent cast. Garfield is fine as a boxer hiding from the police with that motley crew the Dead End Kids. Most notable of these is the beautiful Billy Halop who has some very moving moments. Gloria Dickson, who in real life died very young in a house fire, is strong and very attractive as Halop&#39;s sister, and in the early scenes Ann Sheridan, on the brink of stardom, is a knock-out. May Robson is very funny as a crusty old granny, but Claude Rains proves here that even a great actor can flounder if mis-cast (whoever thought of casting him as a tough New York cop?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Busby Berkeley proves here that he was a fine director with or without musical numbers. The film moves at a terrific pace and the water tower sequence is very suspenseful and well photographed. The ending is contrived, and the plot nothing startling or original, but I still found this a highly enjoyable experience.

80&#39;s comedies (especially ones with John Cusak) are awesome. Almost all are hillarious and instant classics and this film is no exception. Plenty of nods to other films (i.e. Godzilla and Jaws) through out the movie that are so hillarious you&#39;ll be laughing for hours. Some may complain that the movie is a little corny at times but hey it was the 80&#39;s and things were always a little cheesy. Throw in a young Demi Moore and an even louder Bob Cat and you have a laughfest on your fans. If you haven&#39;t seen this, you better soon!!!!!!

I mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this thing. About the only thing I could say good about this horrid film is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie. No proper character development, wait, I&#39;m not even sure they were characters. Set-ups were hokey and inane, and the overuse of split screens was wasted since sometimes they couldn&#39;t even synchronize with alternate shots. If I could give this a zero or minus rating I would. Sadly, it isn&#39;t even worth the time for a few laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#39;s just a sad example of money wasted by Hollywood, and now I waste my time even thinking about it.

I had to watch this movie for professional reasons and can only say it&#39;s a complete waste of time. When running, Baldwin looks like an ape, Characters are dull, same story has been told 1000 times better in other movies. I think everything has been now said about this film, but IMDb requires me to write 10 lines. So:Boring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivialBoring and trivial

Four prisoners share a single cell: the domineering transvestite, Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); Marcus&#39;s idiot savant buddy, Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches, cockroaches, and his little sister; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and Carrère (Gérald Laroche), the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping. After a brick falls from the wall of the cell, the men discover the hidden journal written by a &#39;Fountain of Youth&#39;-obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s. Is this journal the secret to their escape? Or is there something much more sinister behind it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little weary about getting into this film because the only other experience I have with Eric Valette was the dreadful One Missed Call (2008), which I consider to be the worst theatrically released film I&#39;ve ever seen. However, much of what was wrong with One Missed Call could probably be attributed to Klavan&#39;s awful script, because (as I remember) Valette&#39;s direction wasn&#39;t the worst part about the film (unless he chose to include the baby). Anyway, Maléfique was a good way to get my respect back. . . it&#39;s a French film (obviously something I like) and it takes place in prison (which is my second favourite horror setting after asylums). So that&#39;s two points for him before the film even starts. Luckily, Valette had me once the film ended as well. Maléfique is a rather deep, rather complex, rather compelling story of obsession and desperation. . . the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality. While it&#39;s not a terrifying film in the traditional sense, the oddity of its power makes it pretty damn frightening. The period between the climax and conclusion was some of the best film I&#39;ve seen in quite some time and I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: 8.5/10. Quite a bit of respect earned back by Valette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Paramount picked up the rights to make an American remake (surprise surprise). It&#39;s due out in 2009. I&#39;m not sure why, to be honest, as this doesn&#39;t seem like something that would be a big moneymaker here in the states. But, I&#39;ve been surprised before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vive La France! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-AP3-

Fans of horror comedy will like this one. Others might get quickly annoyed and shut it off. It&#39;s sort of a buddy film, with over-the-top violence and gore, deliberately stereotyped characters, and a lot of craziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks to have been made on a budget of about $100, by a bunch of fraternity guys after a big beer keg party. There&#39;s a lead who&#39;s a frustrated nerd, and his loudmouth prank-pulling friend who mocks him about 30 times per second. There&#39;s a cool monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the film. Whenever this thing and its gnarly-mask wearing driver appear, it&#39;s a great scene. There&#39;s a mysterious girl who randomly appears in their back seat, and plenty of giant guys in overalls hanging out in red neck bars. The nerd&#39;s friend never shuts his yap, and gets them in one mess after another. Their arguing got on my nerves, but other aspects of the film make up for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sight gags poking fun at several &#34;psycho tormenting and trying to croak somebody&#34; films are everywhere. Take your pick which one is riffed the most: Hills Have Eyes, Saw, and Jeepers Creepers were some that I recognized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s enjoyable insanity, if you&#39;re in the right frame of mind. Sensory-dulling brewskies with your friends can make viewing this more fun; it&#39;s a good bet that&#39;s the condition of the movie makers when they put this thing together.

Forget Samara/Sadako and Jason...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horror has a new name : GRANNY. The plot is simple but efficient. The actors are good (two thumbs up for &#34;Michelle&#34; and the killer) and the dialogs are even quite clever. From the beginning to the end, the action will leave you breathless, you just can&#39;t escape it... There is blood, awful murders, funny moments, and a sense of perversity that goes far beyond any rule. &#34;Deja vu&#34; ? Surely NOT : &#34;Granny&#34; is not another slash movie, it&#39;s truly a classic of its own... It deserves the success it had and there&#39;s even more success to come with its re-release. Congrats!

This hugely entertaining short is considered one of the best shorts ever, and I certainly won&#39;t argue with that. Even in a country where top-notch animated shorts are created with regularity, this film still manages to stand out. If you ever get the chance to view this film, please do so. It&#39;s only ten minutes long, and yet it contains a man who is obsessed with saws, a woman who vacuums the bathtub, and a nuclear war. What more could you want in a film?

It&#39;s actually a good thing Sean Connery retired as James Bond, as I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t be able to keep up in the nowadays spying-business, where fast cars have been replaced with hi-tech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment. &#34;Cypher&#34; is a pretty inventive Sci-Fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright &amp; claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible. You know the trend in these types of movies: nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot, the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again. The events in &#34;Cypher&#34; supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world, where the major companies don&#39;t really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other&#39;s thunder. Company Digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity, only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor, the Sunways Corporation. Sunways, on the other hand, constantly tries to unmask the Digisoft-rats and recruit them again as double-spies. In between this whole unprofitable business stands Morgan Sullivan; a seemingly colorless thirty-something employee who&#39;s been selected by Sebastian Rooks (the über-spy) to diddle the secret policies of BOTH companies. Trust me, it&#39;s actually less complicated than it sounds and director Vincenzo Natali (the dude from &#34;Tube&#34;) carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters. The first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated John Frankenheimer gem &#34;Seconds&#34;  starring Rock Hudson  as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style. Even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that 60&#39;s film, with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless. There&#39;s also plenty of great action and suspense, most notably when Morgan soberly experiences how the Digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashing-techniques during boring conventions. The middle section of the film drags a little, mainly because you already realize that it&#39;s all just building up towards multiple misleading plot-twists, and I hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the not-so-distant future. Jeremy Northam is perfectly cast and the adorable Lucy Liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side. Regular director&#39;s choice David Hewlett has the most memorable supportive role as the uncannily eccentric Suways engineer Virgil C. Dunn. &#34;Cypher&#34; is well made and adrenalin rushing Sci-Fi entertainment, highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time.

Well, it took them 4 tries, but they finally got it right! In this 4th sequel to the Karate Kid franchise, the producers really hit a home run! Well first of all I applaud them for finally getting rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt he never did service to the role of the Karate Kid. I would have rather have seen Danny &#39;Ralph Mouth&#39; Most in that role. Macchio turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series, and look where his career is now! Instead they put in a girl! They got Hillary Swank, best known for playing a variety of sheman parts in every movie she is in. I personally don&#39;t care for her buck teeth, but thats a personal preference. But still, look how Karate Kid 4 launched her career into orbit! She won a freakin Oscar. Jiminey Christmas! Meanwhile where is Ralphy?? He should put out some amateur porn tape like Screech or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, my only disagreement with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate. As a self-proclaimed master of Karate, I have been the proud owner of a white belt for the last 8 5/8 years. The first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls... well except for Judo... but thats kinda gay. So for the purposes of accuracy, I think they should have stuck with another male for this role. I was thinking perhaps Dennis Franz. He would give the role the depth it requires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps they will listen to my suggestions and make the proper adjustments in Karate Kid 5. Its too Pat Marita is no longer. I was thinking maybe Justin Guarini is the perfect replacement for the lovable Asian fellow Mr. Miyagi. He will give &#34;Wax on wax off&#34; a whole new meaning. HAHAHAHAHAHA funny huh? Anyways, if you are looking for an exciting movie filled with Karate and triumph of the human spirit, Karate Kid 4 is for you. Don&#39;t waste your time with 1-3. This is the Karate Kid for you! This is the Karate Kid for r the ages!

Unfortunately, this has been showing on Star Movies here in Thailand for the last week or so. It&#39;s complete rubbish acting. As another member said, this movie is a good example of &#39;how not to act.&#39; I haven&#39;t seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time. The actors (can you call them &#39;actors&#39;?) are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog. I would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is, you would have to see the movie... but that would be akin to torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines, and the rest of the cast with their accents (fake or contrived) is equally heinous. Another actress with the fake British accent was pretty, yes, but good lord was her accent terrible. Mix that with her (lack of) acting and you have a disaster. She should just have said nothing and I could have accepted her as the pretty girl. Oh my, we just got to the scene where the leading lady&#39;s lover says &#34;Really me?&#34; after a forced crying scene from her. Laughable. No, really, I just laughed out loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the film. Some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are rather nice (minus the actors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old magic potion lady? What?! Another member mentioned the &#39;modern&#39; love song that was in the movie. Totally inappropriate for a period piece set some 500 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand the movie was considered &#39;Big Budget&#39; in Thailand at the time of it&#39;s production. I would be seriously upset if I were the producer of this movie. Just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good (or even mediocre) film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give the King Maker a 1 out of 10, but the costumes and sets make save the film from such a rating. 2 out of 10.

Why didn&#39;t critics like this movie?? I don&#39;t get it. This is easily my favorite Clive Barker effort. &#34;Hellraiser&#34; is a bit too rough around the edges (the film just never leaves that stupid house) and, lets face it, &#34;Lord of Illusions&#34; doesn&#39;t move at all!!! I have loved Barker&#39;s writing for years, especially his &#34;Books of Blood&#34;. Terrifically entertaining. He has a vicious side to him that is totally unlike a Stephen King. He freely mixes in his own homosexuality and odd religious and occultic elements. I love love love love it. I also realize , however, that Barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as he is a horror writer. And fantasy just isn&#39;t my bag. Puts me right to sleep. Always has. I also think Barker works best with short stories. His novels tend to wander a bit. That was my experience when trying to read &#34;The Damnation Game&#34;. It started out well. Then 100 pages in I thought &#34;where is this going?&#34; because it wasn&#39;t going ANYWHERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read &#34;Cabal&#34; (the book Nightbreed was based on) and thought it was good. I ESPECIALLY like the elaboration on Decker&#39;s character. The way the mask talked to him and controlled him. I like the way Barker simply presents it. Black and white. There it is. He gives it a simplicity that&#39;s attractive and believable. When asked why Decker kills he says (simply) &#34;Because I like it&#34;. Probably something Jeffrey Dahmer said at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I actually liked the film Nightbreed better than Cabal. I adore the visual attention to detail that Barker gives to his films. ADORE IT. I think it is just beautiful. Lord of Illusions had some of this as well. Some of the drawings in the beginning, during the Nightbreed credit sequence. It&#39;s like an entire vocabulary Barker dreamed up just for the Nightbreed world. I&#39;d be curious to know how much was purely his design. I know he is an AMAZING artist who his own style and language as an artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nightbreed is also (I think) BArker&#39;s most entertaining film. It moves very quickly. Well edited. It doesn&#39;t drag like Lord of Illusions does a little bit. Very quick. Everything in it is just perfect. It also works as a fantastic and scary little slasher movie. The stuff with the killer in the beginning killing the family and later tormenting the old man in the shop is really scary stuff. That mask is frightening. I&#39;d be curious to know if Barker designed that as well. It&#39;s not just a hokey Jason or &#34;Scream&#34;-type mask. Something about it is really disturbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a great flick. Definitely check it out if you haven&#39;t seen it. Highly recommended. One of my favorite horror films of all time. In my opinion Clive BArker&#39;s best. It IS scary and violent though, be warned

This movie is just lame. A total waste of time and money. The jokes are predictable, the characters are so cliché and the way it talks about RPG gamers is not funny as well. The problem is that the writers seems not to know how a RPG game works and, most important, how to make jokes about this game. Of course there are a bunch of losers who play RPG like freaking retards and total losers. But for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story doesn&#39;t make any sense at all. Who cares about how long a game is being played? The greatest problem in this movie is that the writers and actors didn&#39;t even try to know what RPG is about to make jokes about it. I felt ashamed by watching this lame movie.

I saw this movie considering this as a normal Hollywood movie but then came to know that its a Movie made for TV channel.On my DVD cover out of 2 critics comments one of the critic stephen farber from moviline reveiwed it as A best movie of the Year..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the character were simple and decent performances except the Brain&#39;s character which never gets scope which director wanted to keeps mystery till end.. there was suspense till end but when you see the end that lady Police Officer and main culprit had a Lesbian affair seems to be totally stupid idea.God knows what happens to DAVE the male lead character..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other Critic from Mr. Brown&#39;s Movies said that Shocking and Effective but doesn&#39;t quite live up to all the Hype... which i saw after watching the Movie .for which i was partially aggree...i should have read this first before taking the movie..

As bad as they get. This film commits the fatal error of making the viewer not care what happens to characters. The two women in this flick are so stupid that you begin to root for the bad guys so this thing would end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is one of the few that was so bad that I had to turn to another channel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put in highbrow language, this film lacks verisimilitude. People, not even people from Ohio, simply do not act like this. Well, maybe the writers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not enough beer in the world to make this film bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;F903

This was one of my favorite movies from childhood. I watched it so many times,eventually my tape wore out. I was a huge fan of this show and still am.The thing I love most about this movie is that it appeals to so many people, both young and old. I watch this movie now and laugh just as hard as I did the first time I saw it. I am now able to appreciate all the adult jokes that I never got as a child. My favorite characters are Elmyra and Foulmouth. Almost fifteen years later, my dad (a huge fan of the movie as well) and I are still quoting lines from this movie. I love the part where Foulmouth and Shirley go to the movies. &#34;You save the seats, Shirl and I&#39;ll snag the dadgum snacks.&#34; I also loved the storyline of Plucky and Hampton and his family going to Happy World Land. Wade Pig reminded me a lot of my dad. I love the part when they finally get to Happy World Land and all they do is ride on the monorail. This movie is hilarious and appeals to children and kids. The animation, jokes and everything about it are top notch. If you have not seen it, rent it. You won&#39;t be sorry.

Style but no substance. Not as funny as it should be. Not as deep as it wants to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another in the genre of films about the difficulties of filmmaking. A young filmaker is hired to finish a campy 60s sci-fi movie called Codename:Dragonfly. Think Barbarella, or Danger Diabolique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jeremy Davies is an angst-ridden filmmaker. He&#39;s no hack he&#39;s an artist. The movie he wants to make is a diary of his life. Hardly original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the characters outside of Jeremy Davies filmmaker are as thin as rice-paper. Characters that might be interesting, such as his father, his doppelganger, or Jason Schwarzmann as a hack director are introduced and then shown the door without adding a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is full of eye candy but when compared to other films about filmmakers such as Stardust Memories or 8 1/2 it pales in comparison. Those movies are funny, provocative with well-developed characters. Those movies have lessons that apply outside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie wants to be comic and campy but its just derivative and there is not one funny scene. The filmmakers describe it as a send-up but what&#39;s the satirical target? The actors say it&#39;s an homage but I think I would rather a full-length version of Codename:Dragonfly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coppola is clearly amused by the setting as is evident by the visual humor of the sci-fi movie within a movie. But he fails to share why we should be amused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of the sci-fi movie its just a mess. There are continuity errors, the filmmaker chooses a sci-fi weapon after its already been chosen. What?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because he has a scene were the filmmaker is confronted by the critics complaining about the lack of story, lack of a point, a scene where he admits empty cleverness does not mean that he has addressed those criticisms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if your Roman Coppola you can get away with making a movie about an angst-ridden idealistic filmmaker who doesn&#39;t know what he wants to say and so ends up saying nothing. In that sense it may be considered autobiograhical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would watch it at Circuit City on a wall full of TVs if I had a choice. Watch the 15-minute Codename:Dragonfly movies included on the DVD as extras and then send it back.

I always felt that Ms. Merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills. Familiar to millions as the Lt. on Law and Order, she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. HBO&#39;s Lackawanna Blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as Nanny, successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration. But the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in Lackawanna, New York, a suburb of Buffalo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story could be set in any major African-American community of the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s from Atlanta&#39;s Sweet Auburn to New York&#39;s Harlem. But the segregation-integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at Nanny&#39;s boarding house. The story revolves around Nanny&#39;s relationships with all kinds of people, played by some of the best actors in the business (I purposely did not say black actors--this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black, except for Jimmy Smits, of course) I recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day.

The premise of this movie was decent enough, but with sub par acting, it was just bland and dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILERS The film does not work because of the nature of the death, it was accidental, so although it was a murder it wasn&#39;t like the guy set out to do it. Also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree. There is no emotion in this film. The first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister, and hearing her message. It was dull and boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some polishing, and better acting it could have been pretty good.

This is the most human and humane of movies that I have seen in a long time. The ironies abound, Susan Sarandon as a nun, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a movie that doesn&#39;t preach but neither does it condemn. It is cinema verite at it&#39;s best, and yet the story is fictionalized from several real events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which of the two is more amazing, Sarandon or Penn? It is easy to say who is more likeable, but it is hard to say who is more convincing. they are simply magnificent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may think that all killers should be killed or you may argue that life without parole is no life and that death is more merciful. whatever your personal feeling, this movie gives you a chance to pause and reconsider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end one simply wants to sit in silence and reflect. That is what great drama does, it gives catharsis, it creates a moment in time, a shared memory that touches our humanity.

Bigfoot movies tend to be bad, so I&#39;m not inclined to watch them. However, there were some good commercials on The Sci-Fi Channel, so I decided to watch. A climbing expedition heads into the Pacific northwest to find a a fallen airplane carrying the daughter of the expedition&#39;s leader (played by Lance Hendrickson), and have brought a revolutionary DNA detector that could be used to prove the sasquatch&#39;s existence. And it actually generates some suspense at first. The sasquatch is unseen, but sees the mountain climbers&#39; body heat (like the alien in &#34;Predator&#34;), and I did wonder when it was going to strike. The acting is passable, as is the background music. The dense wooded location is well-used. And when the creature is finally seen, the costume is not bad, though nothing great. But as the film grinds on, it becomes increasingly annoying and absurd. Most of the characters are unpleasant people, rude to each other and only in the expedition for money and publicity (except for Lance Hendrickson&#39;s character), so that it&#39;s impossible to care about what happens to them. And their behavior become increasingly stupid. One man shoots the creature (not fatally), then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark. One female camper puts on a slinky silk negligee before crawling into her sleeping bag, then barely escapes being dragged into the woods by the sasquatch, without getting her hair and make-up messed up. Then, the survivors conclude that the sasquatch is really after the DNA detecting machine and will let them live if they leave it behind (&#34;a creature knows what threatens it&#34;). Obviously, the instinct doesn&#39;t apply to these actors, or they wouldn&#39;t have appeared in this movie. And the ending is so stupid, you&#39;ll want to kick the TV screen. If it weren&#39;t for the script, it would have been a decent horror film.

I&#39;m a big fan of the first Critters movie. The second episode is good,but it&#39;s not as good as the first Critters. The third episode is a little bit boring,but lovely. And WHAT IS THIS?? What a crap! It&#39;s stupid and really,really boring. It&#39;s the worst of the series. I can&#39;t watch it again,because I felt asleep at the first watch. And Ug&#39;s evil side...eeewww...that&#39;s one of the most horribble moments of the movie. In the first 50 minutes,we can&#39;t see the little,furry monsters,that&#39;s the reason why the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could have been much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10

What a waste of a great cast. Figured I&#39;d check it out because it looked like a good stoner comedy with a lot of fairly well-known actors. What it turned out to be was a pointless collection of boring intertwining stories about several characters with minimal connections with each other. Characters who start off looking like decent people but end up with not a single likable or interesting characteristic among them. Calling it a comedy was a stretch as well...the only thing that made me chuckle was Jack Black&#39;s song, which was basically Tenacious D. I waited for something big to happen but ended up with nothing more than 97 minutes of my life wasted.

I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic &#34;Casper the Friendly Ghost&#34; cartoon. Figured it was an early one since Casper didn&#39;t look *right*, the same way Porky Pig doesn&#39;t look *right* in the old 1930&#39;s cartoons. But I digress...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this episode in the friendly phantom&#39;s afterlife concerns him befriending a young fox todd whom he names Ferdie. I remember being happy to see Casper have a friend, as those who have watched the cartoons are wont to know that most people run away from him, screaming &#34;A Ghost!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casper and Ferdie have some fun together until someone else shows up... I hate to leave you with a semi-spoiler, but the cartoon is only seven minutes long, so you can&#39;t really be too ambiguous. Besides, anyone who reads the IMDb synopsis of the cartoon can deduce what happens next...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finale is a bit heartbreaking. In fact, it&#39;s probably the saddest I&#39;ve ever felt watching a cartoon. But that only means that it moved me, which probably explains why I decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not very many others. Or heck, the fact that I actually REMEMBER this cartoon at all is due to its emotional effect on me -- I haven&#39;t seen it since. But the cartoon does end on an upbeat note, and I was pleased to see Casper and Ferdie happy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. Second only to the Warner Bros. cartoon &#34;Peace on Earth,&#34; this is the most I&#39;ve ever been moved by an animated short.

This movie started out good, i felt like i was watching an adult version of Seinfeld. Much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters, and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing. All the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny. Dan Cortese was amazing. I loved him in this role. His agent should show this movie to casting agents. Watch the first few scenes and then find something better, or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess. I found this in a bin at a video store. It cost me two dollars and due to the rareness of this movie i feel like it was a good price.

Chuck Jones&#39;s &#39;Beep Beep&#39; (so called despite the fact that the Road Runner clearly says &#34;Meep Meep&#34;) is the second of the exceptionally popular Road Runner series and is a vast improvement on its predecessor, the historically important but lacklustre &#39;Fast and Furry-ous&#39;. While it features several predictable quickfire gags, &#39;Beep Beep&#39; also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious, longer sequences. Chief among these is a fantastic, extended chase through an old mine in which we see the Coyote and the Road Runner represented by two small lights. There&#39;s also a very funny longer gag involving some rocket-powered roller-skates. &#39;Beep Beep&#39; also sees a great improvement in the representation of Wile E. Coyote. Not only does he look more handsome than his scraggly prototype in &#39;Fast and Furry-ous&#39; but he also draws the audience into the cartoon more with a greater amount of looks to the camera to indicate the brilliance of his idea or his fear of imminent pain. Although it&#39;s a little slow to get going (too many lingering shots of blueprints hinder the pace in some of the early gags), once &#39;Beep Beep&#39; arrives at the mine shaft sequence it&#39;s clear that Jones was beginning to get a real handle on these characters and the greater possibilities of what he could do with them. There are better Road Runner cartoons than &#39;Beep Beep&#39; but there&#39;s a real feeling of triumph about this cartoon, as if it were the confirmation that there was a series to be milked out of this scenario.

Ho hum. Rich good looking kid gets in trouble, poor girl falls in love with him, jealous ex-boyfriend causes tension.. yadda yadda. I actually laughed out loud in many parts of this movie because the next scene was so predictable and just plain stupid. As one scene moved on to the next, I often found myself wondering just how we got there, like I had skipped a few chapters in a book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script was pretty pitiful and didn&#39;t have me or my wife caring much about any of the characters, except the jilted boyfriend. Now, if the ex boyfriend had gotten an axe, and hacked apart the girl and rich kid, then.... then we would have a movie, and all the stupid dialog and leaps in plot could be acceptable. But, since this movie attempts to be touching and totally misses the boat (and ends up resorting to the romance equivalent of divine intervention to try and jerk a tear)... it just falls very very flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this movie. Clip your toenails instead, you will have more fun.

Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50&#39;s is sure different from today&#39;s. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that Buddy Holly(Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son&#39;s work. That&#39;s one of the reasons he didn&#39;t act like Elvis. He stuck to his kinder ways. That really makes him good! When he went to Tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. They hated rock-n-roll, that turned Holly off big time. Getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge to Holly and his friends. He got to tour with Sam Cooke, went to the famous Apollo, which the all-Afro-American audience quickly accepted them, I liked that! And Sam Cooke made sure Holly and his band got some service. That&#39;s what I call tolerance. It&#39;s sad that he, Ritchie Valens, and J.P. &#34;The Big Bopper&#34; Richardson had their music careers cut short by a plane crash in 1959, at least their memories will live on in our hearts. I don&#39;t what inaccuracies were in the movie, all I care is that Buddy Holly overcame the obstacles of music and politics in that time, and the music is nearly-perfect. For Gary Busey, he was perfect in the role, and making the music as well. GOD BLESS YOU GARY BUSEY! 5 STARS!

Well to do American divorcée with more money than brains buys a rundown villa in Tuscany. (Much more money; whilst having to dicker over the price, she subsequently manages to cook sumptuous buffets for her workmen and wander around Italy indefinitely with no job or apparent means of support.) Interminable boredom and the inevitable Italian lover ensue; this is a chick flick in the most pejorative sense of the term. Lane acts like an unskilled clueless teenage ingénue throughout - which dynamically clashes with her seriously fading looks - along the way smashing into a variety of (mostly Italian) cardboard stereotypes, dykes, divas, senile contessas and gigolos among them. Bloated with unnecessary scenes, the most ridiculous being a clumsily inserted and pointless recreation of the fountain scene in &#39;La Dolce Vita&#39;. (A similar conceit was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in &#39;Only You&#39;, Norman Jewison&#39;s vastly superior ode to Italy and romance). &#39;Tuscan Sun&#39; may be the most vacant piece of cinema of the last decade, despite its admittedly well-lensed panoramas of Italy. Bonus negative point for the extraneous lover parachuted in at the last minute to provide requisite Hollywood ending for its targeted audience of Oprah-brainwashed housewives. Avoid at all costs, unless, of course, you view Oprah and Dr. Phil as pinnacles of intelligent discourse.

This film was great!Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job. They both look good together and they both pulled it off.Tasha Smith was so funny as the cousin,and she couldn&#39;t stay out of her business.Essence held it down for her girl, when she needed her. Aloma was sweet and played a dear Grandmother she really reminded me of my grandmother.And Oh,I can&#39;t forget about the stripper, he was so find, and I didn&#39;t know if I should cover my eyes or smile while I watch him reveal his sexiness on the big screen.Damn! he was fine! Tangi looked flawless, and sexy, and she stepped up a notch since Felicity. Over all the movie had a lot &#34;A&#34; List Actors and Actress. It was funny, sexy, crazy, touching,loving, emotional and wonderful. This movie is a must see! Go it get on DVD now if don&#39;t have it!

My first exposure to Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli production company was when an English-dubbed version of Spirited Away was released about 7 years ago. What a wonderfully creative and unique film experience that was! So on that note, I managed to get my movie theatre-employed friend to see this new film of Miyazaki with me especially since he loves all things Disney (this movie&#39;s U.S. distributor). Once again, all I can say is &#34;Wow!&#34; What awesome visuals concerning the way water is depicted as the ocean...and what about the title character&#39;s transformation from a goldfish to...and seeing how some characters&#39; demeanor changes...and, well, watch this movie if you want to know what I&#39;m talking about. Oh, and the voices being used for this American-dubbed version: Tina Fey, Betty White, Liam Neeson, Cloris Leachman, and Lily Tomlin. Good choices all. Does everything make sense? No, but that&#39;s part of the childlike charm that permeates throughout. There&#39;s plenty of funny scenes concerning Ponyo and the boy and many other people they encounter. Oh, I think I&#39;ve written too much so I&#39;ll just highly recommend Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s Ponyo.

While a pleasant enough musical, what stuck with me about this movie was the unexpected comedic chemistry between Basil Rathbone, as the has-been composer, and Oscar Levant as his assistant. Playing a high strung, distracted artistic type (a far cry from his more familiar roles as either menacing villains or the coolly logical Sherlock Holmes), Rathbone&#39;s character looks like he couldn&#39;t find his way out of bed without help. And that help is Starbuck, played with his usual droll humor by Oscar Levant. Upon hiring Crosby&#39;s character as his ghost song writer, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck by saying, &#34;He does all my thinking for me.&#34;, to which Levant responds, &#34;Ah, it&#39;s only a part-time job.&#34; Of course this goes right past (or over) Rathbone, who&#39;s too busy fretting about where his next hit song will come from. As another reviewer said, who knew Rathbone could be so funny! Too bad he didn&#39;t have more opportunities to display his comedic talent.

One of the best of the Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers films. Great music by Irving Berlin. Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks, and Astrid Allwyn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrific songs include &#34;Let Yourself Go,&#34; &#34;Let&#39;s Face the Music,&#34; and &#34;Putting All My Eggs in One Basket.&#34; The last song is introduced by Astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings &#34;Let Yourself Go&#34; with Grable among the backup singers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two nice songs and plays Rogers&#39; mousy sister. &#34;Get Thee Behind Me&#34; is a song that sticks with you for days. She also sings &#34;But Where Are You?&#34; Snappy and fast paced, this entry in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the better ones. The classic and amazing beautiful finale, &#34;Let&#39;s Face the Music and Dance&#34; is among the best-known of their numbers. Rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history.... a shimmering sequined number that swirls around her legs as she dances (weighted hem) and is also slightly see through. Just gorgeous. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters re-created in Pennies from Heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randolph Scott seems an odd choice as Astaire&#39;s pal but he also appeared in their Roberta with Irene Dunne. Luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact. Allwyn has the bigger role but is only OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with &#34;Let Yourself Go&#34;.... Jazzy and thumping, it&#39;s a great song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun all the way, although I got tired of &#34;We Joined the Navy&#34; after the third time....

I really wish that when making a comedy, the people actually tried to make it funny. This is a film that you can sit through, but nothing is special about it. After watching it, you will say that it was alright. It was not boring to watch, but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. story. This movie wanted to be &#34;Tootsie&#34;, but instead it failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 1 out of 10.

Well the film starts good, but after half an hour it becomes boring and stupid, when all the plot is about Karen&#39;s( that was the name of the girl right?) pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end of the movie it&#39;s really corny and the characters really dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know who is more stupid, if the girl because she came back with her old boyfriend or the boy for the way he was used for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway my conclusion is this: definitely not the best eighties comedy, just another movie like many others with nothing special, they could do it better but they ruined it, if only the plot had take another way but they keep that pregnancy stuff and they definitely ruined, so final conclusion: i don&#39;t like.

But I doubt many were running to see this movie. Or &#34;Some Came Running Out Of The Cinema&#34;. Okay, that&#39;s a bit harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film starts in an unintentionally comical way: Frankie-boy comes back to his hometown after many years (this already smells of clichés) and the whole town is shaken by his arrival: he is talked about, everyone wants to talk to him, and every woman he meets flirts with him like there&#39;s no tomorrow - even his niece hints that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with Frankie-boy a little longer! Even his pretty niece wants a piece of him! Sounds like one of those laughable &#34;Mike Hammer&#34; episodes where EVERY single female wants Stacey Keach. And, like Stacey Keach, Frankie-boy is anything but a good-looking woman&#39;s wet dream. In real life, someone like Sinatra (without the fame) wouldn&#39;t get within 100 m of someone as beautiful as MacLaine. But in this Hollywood movie it&#39;s the other way around: MacLaine is absolutely nuts about Frankie-boy, but HE couldn&#39;t care less! Sinatra plays his &#34;cool&#34; shtick much too often in his movies, and it is rarely credible. Dean Martin is kind of miscast; he isn&#39;t miscast as a card-player, but rather because of the accent which simply doesn&#39;t suit him. MacLaine is charming as ever, but she plays a caricature - and this reliance on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film. The main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seen-it-all-before movies and cheap novels; Frankie is the &#34;cool cat&#34; who comes back to town to get all the women, and he couldn&#39;t care less about his writing (which, predictably, eventually garners recognition); Martin is a sleazy but friendly card-player; MacLaine is the dumb, but very likable bimbo; Frankie&#39;s blond love-interest is a snotty literary expert; Frankie&#39;s brother is the successful guy who married into his wife&#39;s business and has a lousy marriage; and so on. Clichés.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story contains a couple of coincidences which are a little too far-fetched for my taste: Frankie just happens to bump into his niece in a locale; his niece just happens to be meters away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the FIRST time; and then there is the awful, stupid ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In it, a drunk guy bent on killing Frankie-boy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all places! The place is utterly crowded, with the typical noise and chaos - plus it&#39;s happening in the evening - and yet the guy somehow finds Frankie (in spite of being drunk as a doorknob) and shoots at him. But guess who he kills? MacLaine. She jumps in front of the bullet to save Frankie: a cliché which comic-book writers might cringe at. This utterly pathetic, over-dramatic, and annoying ending certainly cannot please any, even semi-intelligent, viewer. And this happens on the same day that MacLaine and Sinatra got married! The writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life - how else is the writing of this movie to be explained? There is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with Frankie &amp; Martin vs. some cliché caricatures out of the writer&#39;s &#34;vivid&#34; imagination. (It was like a damn Western suddenly.) Another dumb thing is the way Sinatra was crazy about the boring snotty-nosed bimbo and pretty much ignored MacLaine. As the movie progresses we find out that Sinatra finds MacLaine to be too dumb for him, just as the blond bimbo finds Sinatra to be too low-class for her. There is a certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding MacLaine. MacLaine is treated as worthless by everyone, while the blond bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellectual; the ironic truth is that the latter&#39;s character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual; her behaviour, comments, and opinions are mostly clichéd, silly, confused, pretentious, and primitive. At least MacLaine&#39;s character KNOWS that she (MacLaine) is dumb. There is another irony that I didn&#39;t fail to notice: Sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story - much like the writer of this movie, and that&#39;s why he came up with the corny, crappy finale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film basically has a solid cast, and the photography is nice, but the script, though sometimes okay, relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on reality-based characters and events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re interested in reading my &#34;biographies&#34; of Shirley MacLaine and other Hollywood intellectuals, contact me by e-mail.

Fragile Carne, just before his great period. Although it is sometimes hesitantly directed, and marred by longueurs, HOTEL DU NORD is full of the faded charm and beauty typical of French films of the late 1930s, as well as a relative lightness of touch unusual with this director. All of his great virtues are here: the cramped interiors broken up by gliding, complex, delicious camera movements; a melancholy deployment of light and shade; remarkable, wistful sets by Alexander Trauner, which are so evocative that they, as the title suggests, take on a shaping personality of their own; the quietly mournful music of Maurice Jaubert; a seemingly casual plot about romance, tragedy and fatalism that casts a noose over its characters; extraordinary performances by some of the greatest players of all time, in this case Louis Jouvet and Arletty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the film&#39;s biggest failing, and I find myself astonished (as someone who usually, didactically, minimises its importance) to admit it, is its script. It has plenty of wit and poignancy, but without the poetry and irony regular Carne collaborator Jacques Prevert brought to their best films, it cannot avoid slipping into cliche (even if it is only cliche in hindsight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ostensibly set in the boarding house, the film sets up its opening idea of community with two interconnecting tales of doomed love, and emotional, metaphysical and actual isolation The doomed love scenario is the one that works least well. Annabella is very beautiful, but not very good at doing tragic, while Aumont&#39;s callowness, brilliantly appropriate though it may be, by its nature obtrudes any real, felt, romance. Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I find it hard to sympathise with a couple, so young, so attractive, who, after only a few months, are so racked with despair that they have to shoot each other. Their high-flown lines are rather embarrassing too. Of course, this affair is not meant to be plausible - they are symbolic of youth, hope and possibility being crushed in France, or maybe France itself, despairing, resigned, waiting for death. For symbols to be truly powerful, they must convince on a narrative level, which, I feel, they don&#39;t quite here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What saves this plot is its connection with the story of M. Edmond, a character linked to the great tradition of French gangsters. Although we only learn it gradually, he is a killer in hiding, living off the prostitute played by Arletty, having dobbed in his accomplices. In his previous &#39;role&#39; - and the theatricality of his position is crucial - he had one set of traits; in hiding he has assumed their complete opposite. Living a rather aimless life, he is profoundly shaken by the lovers&#39; pact, and becomes fatalistic, realising the folly of trying to cheat death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this way - the admission that one is less a person than a collection of signs, and that death is an unavoidable reality the most powerful masculinity must succumb to - Edmond is like a romantic prototype of Melville&#39;s clinical killers. With one exception - he gives briefly into hope, a delusion which only strenghtens - if that&#39;s not too much of an unbearable irony - his fatal resolve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this could have been trite if it wasn&#39;t for the truly amazing performance of Louis Jouvet. I had studied his theatrical work at college, but this was my first taste of his screen talents, and he reveals himself to be worthy of the greats - Grant, Mastroianni, Clift, Mason, Mitchum, Cotten - giving a quiet nobility to a role which is more of a conception (he, needless to say, is allegorical too) than an actual person. Edmond begins the film a minor supporting character, but emerges as a tragic hero of some force. Like all those major actors, Jouvet&#39;s brilliance lies in what he conceals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a formal level, what amazes is Carne&#39;s grasping, ten years before its flourishing, of the techniques of the great Hollywood melodramas of Sirk, Ophuls, Ray and Minnelli. Although his theatricality lacks the fluidity and clear-eyed beauty of Sierck&#39;s contemporary German melodramas (check out the masterpieces ZU NEUEN UFERN and LA HABENERA), Carne&#39;s style truly fits his theme - that of entrapment, paralysis, resignation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film&#39;s principle motif is that of water - the credits float and dissolve, the hotel stands by a waterway - but instead of Renoir&#39;s open river of possibility, we have a canal, stagnant and manmade, going nowhere. The film begins as it ends, and the setting never changes, except for one brief interlude from which both escapees are doomed to return. Characters can only escape through death - their entrapment is emphasised by the narrow rooms they occupy, the walls and frames that hold them captive, the windows that look out on an escape they can never achieve. Any hope at the end, therefore, is profoundly, if romantically, compromised.

&#34;Cinderella&#34; is one of the most beloved of all Disney classics. And it really deserves its status. Based on the classic fairy-tale as told by Charles Perrault, the film follows the trials and tribulations of Cinderella, a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable stepsisters. When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: the King wants to get the Prince to marry), Cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her. But there is a Fairy Godmother on hand...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of &#34;Cinderella&#34; on its own wouldn&#39;t be able to pad out a feature, so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise, the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the Fairy Godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become Cinderella&#39;s true sidekicks. The mice Jaq and Gus are the main sidekicks, and their own nemesis being the stepmother&#39;s cat Lucifer. Their antics intertwine generally with the main fairy-tale plot, and are for the most part wonderful. Admittedly, the film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the stepsisters depart for the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really gets going again and surprisingly (since &#34;Cinderella&#34; is the most worn down story of all time, probably) ends up as one of the most involving Disney stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The animation and art direction is lovely. All of the legendary Nine Old Men animated on this picture, and Mary Blair&#39;s colour styling and concept art (she also did concept art and colour styling for &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34;, &#34;Peter Pan&#34;, &#34;The Three Caballeros&#34; and many many others) manage to wiggle their way on screen. The colours and designs are lovely, especially in the Fairy Godmother and ball scenes, as well as in those pretty little moments here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, &#34;Cinderella&#34; ranks as one of the best Disney fairy-tales and comes recommended to young and all that embodies the Disney philosophy that dreams really can come true.

This is unlike any other movie, the closest thing I can compare it to is a Woody Allen film... But where as Woody Allen is constantly fathoming human foibles Bret Carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to grips with that one crippling insecurity that tends to define us for better or worse. In the Case of Lou, it is the root cause of his stuttering, which can be traced back to a singular child hood trauma that is revealed through flash backs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and I believe they all deserve a chance for redemption, although diversity of human character is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place, so maybe we shouldn&#39;t fix our neurosis anymore than we should fix our noses or Breasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an indie film shot on a long shoestring, but the production values are tremendous as is the scope of the film. I feel like its a quirky Gem for the self-help market. I really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next, i could imagine a career along the lines of Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, although usually when a guy like this breaks through, he goes off and makes &#34; X MEN&#34; and his humble quirky origins are soon forgotten or are they.... X Men is aout a bunch of freaks if i remember correctly :)

&#34;Why are there so many songs about rainbows, and what&#39;s on the other side?&#34; Kermit poses this relatively simple double interrogative near the beginning of &#34;The Muppet Movie&#34; while singing his signature song, &#34;The Rainbow Connection.&#34; As time goes by, the question and the movie only gain profundity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m going to forgo the review of this movie as a children&#39;s comedy, but look at it instead as a classic for every generation to love with serious ideals and a heartwarming message that gains more warmth with each passing year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the milestones in my own life come creeping up on me, I hear more and more the evocative strains of that elementary ditty, and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to anyone&#39;s life, because we all dream. And that is what this movie is about. It&#39;s not just a bunch of puppets-- it&#39;s a bunch of puppets having the strength to pursue their dreams, which is a good lesson for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while the humor and mirth of the film always feel good, they&#39;re not a fair judge of the movie. Only &#34;The Rainbow Connection&#34; and the powerful emotions it will realize. And it all fits in: &#34;Rainbow Connection&#34; *is* the Muppet Movie, and vice versa. It&#39;s existentialism meets children&#39;s entertainment-- there&#39;s no simpler way to describe it.

Spunky journalist Holly Hunter produces investigative news reports for a major news network. She&#39;s a motor-mouthed maverick, dazzlingly good at her job and with little time for romantic relationships. Enter William Hurt and Albert Brooks, two men who vie for her love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brooks is an old school journalist who adores Holly because she represents everything good about journalism. They both believe that the media exists to test the Gods, educate the public and fight for truth. Children of the sixties, they embody hippie values. They&#39;re defenders of the public good. Knights who fight valiantly with pen and camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Hurt, in contrast, is a far more complex character. Initially awkward, clumsy and self-depreciating, he gradually reveals himself to be a sexy and manipulative high achiever, skilled at climbing the corporate ladder. Unlike Holly and Brooks, he&#39;s symbolic of modern media values: news as spectacle, journalism as entertainment, news anchor as celebrity, truth as subject to editing board. We want to despise him and his blip-time junk food journalism, but we just can&#39;t quite manage it. He&#39;s playing the game by its own rules. Do we condemn him for lacking a moral backbone? Do we condemn the game? Can the game exist if its rules are disobeyed? How have these rules evolved? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#39;t Lumet&#39;s and Chayefsky&#39;s &#34;Network&#34;, and so the film never bothers to answer or raise these questions. Content to keep things on the level of light comedy, it ends with Hurt being promoted to London Division and Brooks being booted to a tiny community network. Holly, having rejected both men, remains caught between them. The last bastion of media integrity, this spunky reporter remembers her roots, mourns the loss of Brooks and warns herself to be on the guard of future William Hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a cute ending, but compared to &#34;Network&#34; the film seems positively trite. Chayefsky&#39;s vision is one in which global media, despite its ubiquity, offers less meaningful information. He foresees a world in which globalisation has homogenized cultures, information has become subject to corporatisation and a handful of media monopolies control all international news. This is a world in which the truth is subject to shareholder meetings and economic interests. A world in which viewer ratings determine content and opinion polls dictate top stories. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this is why &#34;Broadcast News&#34;, which longs for the glory days of journalism, ends on such a bittersweet note. It knows what the future holds. Made in 1987, its been living it for at least a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But today, in the digital age, things are even worse. Mergers and acquisitions have left a very small number of massive firms dominating the communication landscape. With this has come the hyper-commercialism of content, the barrier between the creative/editorial side and the commercial side all but collapsed. Today everyone might be able to start their own blog or website, but these are grass roots affairs. As the communication reach of the individual increases (due to technological progress - email, internet, electricity, air mail etc) the size of the individual&#39;s world increases likewise. He must project his voice both further and louder, futilely battling that deafening white noise, the incessant verbal static that is the global community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ultimately you need two things according to democratic theory. Firstly, you need a rigorous coming of people in power and people who want to be in power, both in the private and public sector. Secondly, you need a wide range of informed opinions on all important issues of the day. In a democratic society the media system as a whole should produce this sort of culture. Unfortunately, the structure we currently have in the global system works directly against the needs of democratic journalism and a democratic society. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10  This is lightweight stuff, but a witty script, some funny moments and a brief cameo by Jack Nicholson, elevate it above most other films about journalism. Interestingly, unlike most films about the media, it never dips into satire, and instead plays things as a straight love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth one viewing.

This is not a film you can really analyse separately from it&#39;s production. The audience became the film-makers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the American film industry; we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend. How is it possible to be objective? This is our movie, isn&#39;t it? Or is it? There may be nothing more disingenuous than a film-maker who promotes himself as the audience&#39;s friend, giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them. Just look at that prime self-publicist Eli Roth, promising gore-hounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films, only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like &#39;Hostel&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David R. Ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film, but he was, quite understandably, quick to engage with it. He took the carnival-huckster school of film-making to a new level, getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy. So many have enthused over this interactive, democratic approach to film-making that they seem to have missed the point - that this is the most cynical form of film-as-marketing. Nothing is included that the film-makers know the fans won&#39;t buy, and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated. The fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#39;t this just the evolution of the focus group approach? Individual creativity, talent, craft, ideas, all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses. It&#39;s a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings don&#39;t make for good movies - why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different? Because we happen to be film fans? Well, thank god for us, because otherwise I might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, I had fun at the movie - a midnight showing, fresh from the pub and with a bucket of ice-cream - but it actually had relatively little to do with the film, and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere. Like Christmas, everyone seemed determined that they would have fun, no matter what. There was laughter, but I don&#39;t know if it was with the film, or at the film. With a film as calculated as this one, is that even a meaningful distinction? There are some genuinely good aspects to the film. Samuel L. Jackson gives a well-judged performance, pure self-parody but with a real sense of pleasure. Rachel Blanchard and Lin Shaye are decent in limited roles, and there are one or two inspired moments - the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stock characters are to be expected, but the total lack of suspense isn&#39;t. What&#39;s the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there&#39;s no creeping menace? There are several snake-jumps-out moments, but they&#39;re incredibly badly staged. Only the annoying British man gets a decent pulpy death scene - the other killings are oddly flat. The demise of the honeymoon couple, for instance, is shamefully botched. Most of the actors fail to make an impression; it&#39;s a shame that a charismatic actress like Julianna Margulies should seem so tired (when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a roller-coaster, she could be talking to the audience - the film falls far short).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are worse movies, but there are many, many better; another reviewer on this site compared this film with &#39;Lake Placid&#39;, and it&#39;s as apt a contrast as any I can think of. That film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent, the jokes were funny, the suspense sequences were scary, and it wasn&#39;t devised by committee. That the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus. I don&#39;t need a post-pub midnight showing to have a good time with that film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film will, in time, fade to become a mere footnote in film history. If it sets a precedent, however, I&#39;m genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time. In all probability, nothing much will come of it. Perennial popcorn favourites - &#39;Raiders of the Lost Ark&#39;, &#39;Alien&#39;, &#39;Halloween&#39; and of course, &#39;Star Wars&#39; - just aren&#39;t produced by group-think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time, I&#39;ll tell you what - I haven&#39;t half got a craving for some Ingmar Bergman.

I am surprised people, after such lousy movies getting to be in the top 250 or just being in the 7.0&#39;s, I thought more people would get a kick out of &#34;Throw Momma from the Train&#34;. This was a great comedy by two terrific comedic actors, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito. Together they made a great duo of insanity and obsession. Billy is a man who just lost his million dollar story to his ex wife and repeatedly wishes her dead, Danny has an insane and senile old mother who just abuses him. When Billy gives some &#34;misunderstood&#34; advice to Danny, Danny offers a proposition to Billy, if he kills his ex wife, Billy has to kill his mother. This is a crazy and funny story that can always get a good laugh. Please, sit back and enjoy this movie, people! It&#39;s a good one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10

I love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great American sitcom. I watched five episodes of this abomination, and the only person that came close to an actual teacher was the old guy that sort of loved and hated his job. The rest of them were just pretty people trying to read the lines written by people who never actually went inside of a real classroom. I loved how every episode consisted of the two idiots (one who got laid and the other who didn&#39;t) getting into some form of zany trouble that indirectly involved their students. The British girl who thought she found an likable quality in the main idiot, but in the end was somehow shocked that he turned out to be a jackass. The hot chick that was there for the particular purpose of being hot, and the principal and her lackey that served to somehow move the almost non-existent plot forward. I loved how almost all the teachers on this show were very young, but I ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers that you had . . . did they look like that? Or did you go to the high school that had middle-aged people teaching in it? That is the high school that everyone else went to. The show lacked any form of research into what goes on in schools. In public schools, principals do not have the power to higher and fire teachers, the school board does, but in every episode that I watched the principal made threats to fire her teachers. Think back to your history class . . . . . or think of any history class, did you ever see an incredibly hot British chick teach an American History class? No. Did you ever see a teacher&#39;s lounge that is so huge that you could actually play basketball in? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teachers could have been a great show had it actually of based itself in some form of reality. What makes teaching funny is the stories that you get from interaction with students, and the teachers find it funny because they deal with the students day in and day out. The overemphasis on their lives outside of teaching just made it another four camera sitcom that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines, and I&#39;m sorry, I just didn&#39;t buy it. The show could have modeled itself after other currently successful sitcoms and used a single-camera format, and it should have centered more around the teacher&#39;s relationships with their students and not with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets a star for trying and a star for the hot chick (she was really hot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as a hacks attempt to understand a profession. I only hope that if they make another sitcom based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity such as this never touches the television screen.

I have to admit I am prejudiced about my vote on this film, but I have strong reasons as I know some of the true history that was given the Hollywood treatment here. Edna Ferber&#39;s novel upon which this is based is from an era where real names can&#39;t be used. In a way, this film is all smoke &amp; mirrors. Even though it was released in 1946, it was filmed shortly after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman is at her most radiant in this movie as a brunette. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She plays a beautiful woman who is trying to trade on her beauty to get a rich husband. Today that is a gold digger, but in this social era, she is desirable &amp; the kind of woman who makes all the men want her, &amp; all the old snooty society types talk of her &amp; avoid her, while wishing they were her. Ingrid is at her best &amp; plays this role well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some sympathy for Ingrids character is raised in the New Orleans section of this film as she manages to get a decent belated tomb for her scandalized mother as part of the settlement by her relatives to get her to leave New Orleans. The snooty family of relatives there are so scandalized by her that they will do almost anything she asks to get her to leave town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Cooper is good in this film though he already appears to be aging a bit to play a dashing Texan Bachelor/Gambler. He pulls it off well considering that handicap which he appeared older than he was due to his real life chain smoking. Flora Robison as Ingrid&#39;s Maid got nominated for an Oscar as supporting actress in this film. Jerry Austin as Cupidor was over-looked in many ways for his role but is the only comic relief in the film &amp; does it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the film moves to Saratoga, it depicts accurately how important Saratoga was in that era. I like the sequence when Bergman walks to the Saratoge Spring to get some of the &#34;sulfur&#34; water which everyone considered so healthy then. When she drinks some she forces herself not to make a face and comments how good it is &amp; that she must have more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real history is the railroad battle which really occurred on the rail line in Tunnel, New York- which is the actual Saratoga Trunk the film title is derived from. This battle actually happened in 1869 between agents for Andrew Carnagie &amp; J. P. Morgan. The line was the economic key to the country in 1869 connecting coal country &amp; the east coast. The references to it are throughout the film are very real. There is even some dialog describing Carnagie as a &#34;Scot&#34; though the reference is vague &amp; unfamiliar to anyone not knowing the history around the battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The railroad line &amp; the railroad tunnel in Tunnel, New York (zip code 13848) still exist although the film was shot in California. The real tunnel is about 1 mile long. It is still part of a key freight line today, years after this occurred. I grew up there. Gary Cooper&#39;s line in the film while he is riding the train into the tunnel is right, it is still &#34;mighty pretty country&#34;.

This is better than the early Cronenberg horror films, but nothing more than your basic what-is-real story. The videogame theme has been told before too. Nothing original is left except the weird Cronenberg atmosphere (which is not that strong here) with the amusing sexual references and Shore&#39;s dark score. The story never grabs your full attention. It just flows forward event after event with boring pace. Rating 4/10.

Being a science fiction fan from my early childhood (long time since) I always hated implausible plots. It&#39;s a pity that most authors of science fiction stories for children do not show this kind of respect for their audience. I always suspected them of thinking: &#34;children are to dumb to realise, so we don&#39;t have to strive&#34;. The writer of &#34;Science Fiction (2002)&#34; is no exception. The story is about a boy who is instigated by his new friends to spy after his parents, because they think that the parents are aliens. As intriguing the idea sounded to me, as much was I bored by its realisation. It seemed to me that the filmmakers had exactly this one idea and tried to stretch it over the ninety minutes by dunking it into a dark, stylish and painstakingly slow atmosphere. The only thing that kept me in my seat was the question &#34;how do they manage to get out of this implausible rubbish&#34;? And then - bang - they did not even try. So if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents, go and watch &#34;Klatretøsen (2002)&#34; instead.

Back in 1983, Michael Jackson&#39;s popularity was such that if he wanted to make a $1 million horror music video with the &#34;American Werewolf&#34; team and featuring the voice of Vincent Price, then that was exactly what he was going to do. And never has a music video created such a sensation, before or since ... when it was released on VHS, this 13-minute short became the world&#39;s largest selling musical of all time. But odds are you already know all about it, as whenever there&#39;s a list of the greatest music videos of all time, this one almost invariably takes the top spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins with Michael Jackson walking down a dark street with his date after their car has broken down. He explains to her that he&#39;s &#34;not like other men&#34; (damn right), and then the full moon appears from behind the clouds. His girlfriend stands there and screams, and screams, and then screams some more, during a lavish transformation sequence as Michael Jackson becomes a werewolf. He chases her through the forest, catches her and we ... cut to a movie theatre. Ah, all of this is just occurring in a horror movie that Michael Jackson and his date are watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we&#39;re five minutes in and still no sign of the song &#34;Thriller&#34;. Extravagant, much? Anyway, you must know how it goes from here ... dancing, singing ... graveyard ... Vincent Price ... zombies ... &#34;What&#39;s the Problem?&#34; ... then end credits. End credits for a friggin&#39; music video. &#34;Thriller&#34; isn&#39;t one of Michael Jackon&#39;s most memorable songs, but even by today&#39;s standards it sure is a bitch of a visual experience. If you still haven&#39;t seen it in it&#39;s entirety, then you definitely should someday soon.

After reading all of the rave reviews about this film and a few that give it a so-so. I finally decided to throw in my no cents worth. I agree with most on the point that if it hadn&#39;t been for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry it would have been a disaster. Filmed in Mariette OH. just north of Dogpatch where all the real talent fled south down I-77 years ago, at least as far as a tank of gas would allow. I did get a chuckle from reviewers who subtly claim that they cerebrate a little better than most by claiming they followed the plot without an inkling of confusion. This wee tale by the Brothers Crook is like an old record with a skip in it. As an American I understand the difficulties Ind film artists have to face. A trip to Romania would have wiped out the budget for sure. Lets face it this whole film was a loop de loop of Claire in the gas station, Claire on the side of the road, Claire under the bleachers, Claire in the house, Claire in the cornfield, Claire at school. Claire here and Claire there. It almost became monotonous and would have if she had not been the best actor in the cast. Josh and Jeff have to make a living but don&#39;t write a two page script and turn it into an hour,twenty flick. Before writing another screenplay about dreaming ghosts watch an episode or two of Ghost Whisperer or something and get a little background. All of the cast except the above mentioned and a couple of others were engaged in their first and last film. Also, there is an appearance by co-director Jeff as he is in all his films. Just like Alfred Hitchcock, eh? One thing the film had going for it is that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation on Lauren Lewis&#39; derrière. Well, with all sarcasm now satisfied I still recommend the film for the horror buff just to see this young actress in the formative time of her career (I hope)and that Chris Ferry has established himself as a villain worth watching.

well &#34;Wayne&#39;s World&#34; is long gone and the years since then have been hard for snl off-shoot movies. from such cinematic offal as &#34;It&#39;s Pat&#34; to the recent 80 minute yawn, &#34;A Night at the Roxbury,&#34; many have, no doubt, lost faith that any other snl skit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen. well fear not because Tim Meadows comes through in spades. the well-written plot maintains audience interest until the very end and while it remains true to the Leon Phelps character introduced in the five minute skit, the storyline allows the character to develop. the humor (consisting largely of sex jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than i have in any movie in recent memory. its a just great time if you don&#39;t feel like taking yourself too seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen of &#34;Saved by the Bell&#34; fame, makes an appearance in the film and looks incredible. finally Billy Dee Williams, reliving his Colt 45 days, gives the movie a touch of class. and for those out there who are mindless movie quoters like myself, you will find this movie to be eminently quotable, &#34;ooh, it&#39;s a lady!&#34;

All I can say about the Necromaniac/Schizophreniac 2 series is... if you are even remotely &#34;PC&#34; or don&#39;t have a seriously messed up sense of humor, then you probably wont get it. As sick and disgusting as this movie is, it really is a comedy and not a &#34;horror&#34; movie at all. If you can appreciate somebody who pushes the bounds of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits imaginable, to the point where is becomes so out of hand that it&#39;s comical, then you must see this to believe it. This movie is so out of control that a major film studio couldn&#39;t touch this with a 10 foot pole (with a condom on the end). In my opinion though, the best, most extreme pieces of art come from way underground. If you don&#39;t stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing, then they reject it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen stacks of terrible, boring, z-grade, Indy movies that were just a waste of a perfectly good VHS tape or DVD-R. I have also seen stacks of stink bombs coming from the big named studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars. When a NO BUDGET film like these two from Ron Atkins/John Giancaspro come out and blow all of the other &#34;shock&#34; films completely out of the water, you really have to take a second look at the whole Indy movie scene. After seeing this, you can really see how much freedom an Indy film maker can have when they work on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funny thing is, even the other people who saw this movie and &#34;hated it&#34; admit to the fact that they laughed all the way through it. I don&#39;t think that is is possible for anybody to get bored watching either of these two. So if don&#39;t take everything that you seen in the mainstream media too seriously, and are able to laugh at a misanthropic, puppet wielding psychopath who has finally snapped, YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS. You may just be able to see it for the stand alone, cult classic that it is. Both Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites in my collection of well over 1000 dvds.

this film has no plot, no good acting, to be honest it has nothing, the same songs play over and over awful acting and if you can actually sit there and watch the whole thing and enjoy it there is something wrong with you. I wish i could give this 0 out of 10 but i cant so it has to be a 1 which is generous! ice-t isn&#39;t even a good rapper and even worse at acting, every bit of the film is rubbish, i got this film on DVD without knowing what it was for the price of £1.99 and thought that i had picked up a bargain, i then looked at the IMDb rating and didn&#39;t take it into consideration but after watching it found out that the DVD i had bought was a complete waste of time, money and electricity. if you have this film there are two things you can do sell it to someone who doesn&#39;t know about it or burn it!

This was one of the most mixed up films I have ever seen. Everything in the movie seemed to be attached to justify some other element that had been glued on. There is even a talking buffalo that wants his wet nose rubbed to make the magic happen. Even the brutal father seems to be stuck in just to give the kids an excuse to fly away in a wagon. It was laughable, but in an uncomfortable way because of the serious subjects that seemed to be used just to set up the plot.

When I first saw this movie, I had thought that it was going to be a terrible upset, being directed by first-time director Liev Schrieber. What I saw in the next 130 minutes completely and utterly changed my mind. Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, Everything is Illuminated tells the story of a young Jewish-American collector(masterfully played by Elijah Wood)who is trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis in WWII. He travels to Germany and enlists in the help of a 20-something, club hitting translator and his grandfather. This results in a rigid search across the country, and they are determined to find what they are looking for. Shot in some of the most beautiful countryside in the world, Everything Is Illuminated delivers tension between the translator and his grandfather, and of the help that Jonathan needs to find his quarry. There is much religious matter as well, as the grandfather refers to Jonathan as &#34;The Jew.&#34; All in all, This is a movie that deals with finding yourself and loving family. I give this wonderful, if not illuminated movie, a 10 out of 10.-Arjun

I bought this movie exciting a gloriously gratuitous, over the top, entertaining bloodbath. I got none of them. This film fails on practically every level, not in the least frightening, or funny, it is simply terrible film-making, and never provides the audience with anything worth seeing. What is so bad about it is that far from being as raw, violent and brutal as it had promised to be, there is very little violence at all. Virtually no blood shed, and no excitement whatsoever. Acting, direction and dialogue is absolutely unbearable. Honestly, it is truly laughable. I could hardly sit through this total garbage once; I certainly will never want to watch it again. Don&#39;t waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this; it is truly possibly the worst film ever made. If I could give it minus stars, I would.

&#34;The Garden of Allah&#34; is a prime example of &#34;popular women&#39;s literature&#34;, turn of the XXth century style, combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism and the sado-masochistic bite of Catholic guilt. Just as Jane Eyre couldn&#39;t really be happy until her castle burned down around her and her lover was permanently maimed for his sins, or the heroine of &#34;Rebecca&#34; couldn&#39;t find true fulfillment in her marriage until her lordly husband was put on trial for the murder of his first wife (and her castle burned down around her), or poor Psyche couldn&#39;t leave well enough alone and had to extract Cupid&#39;s secret at all costs, Domini, the devout Catholic heroine of this piece of tripe, can only find true sexual realization by inadvertently marrying a man who has renounced his sacred religious vows. Like all such narratives aiming to stimulate the female reader and induce the vapours, this one relies on the oldest tricks in the book: basic misunderstandings and the inability to express one&#39;s true feelings at the right place and at the right time until it is too late. The logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be indulged in as long as one is willing to eventually pay a high enough price for it in atonement in the last act. It is Paul Claudel reduced to beauty salon magazine standards. Oh well... It could have been much worse and it often was...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the religious overtones, the film&#39;s plot is that of your basic porn flick: Oversexed monk driven mad by abstinence escapes to the desert where he has a few rolls in the dunes with a romantic, shapely but naive Catholic heiress before reintegrating his monastery, all passion spent, leaving her to clean up his mess. And I really resent another commentator&#39;s comparison with Anatole France&#39;s &#34;Thais&#34;, a sophisticated novel whose intention was to make fun of the whole concept of Catholic sexual repression, some of which transpired in Massenet&#39;s opera of the same name, thankfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what makes this picture unique in the annals of commercial female eroticism, of course, is the enormous constellation of talents gathered under one banner to make this cinematic wet dream come to shimmering, vibrant life. Imperishable Technicolor photography that will outlive us all, a truckload of worthy character actors (including one cute dog), a music score by Max Steiner that seems determined to accomplish the &#34;composed film&#34; that Michael Powell (who, ironically, had a bit part in the 1927 silent version) always dreamed about, tittering at times on the brink of dissonance but always coming through in splendid symphonic, operatic exoticism, a dream-like atmosphere where material considerations are no object, characters travel as if by magic from one spot to the next, dialog is sparse, vague and suggestive, the art direction is close to celestial, flower arrangements appear in the humblest hut or tent, the heroine&#39;s wardrobe is inexhaustible and all the male characters are either aristocrats, saints, doomed but horny sinners, mystics or poets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahh... Hollywood! The MGM DVD presentation of this film is bare bones but impeccable. The bit rate is very high throughout, the colour registration is almost always perfect and the 2.0 mono sound truly does justice to Max Steiner&#39;s score and to Boyer&#39;s penultimate confession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A historical note on this sort of &#34;women&#39;s subject&#34;: The following year (1937), Julien Duvivier, visibly inspired by &#34;The Garden of Allah&#34;, directed &#34;Carnet de Bal&#34;, where a very similar clothes-horse butter-won&#39;t-melt-in-her-mouth heroine (widowed after taking care of an ailing husband in the exotic remoteness of some impossibly romantic Alpine lakeside villa) wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book. She finds them all in time, only to realize that whatever feeling there was at one point between her beaus and herself were either misunderstood, overestimated or else had lifelong tragic consequences. It was Duvivier&#39;s cynical way of telling us to beware of impossibly idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later.

Nice, pleasant, and funny, but not earth-shattering. It does a good job of showing the &#34;behind the scenes&#34; world of theater groups and the lives of the actors. The three witches are great- both on- and off-stage. I would assume the movie works wonderfully (lots of apparent inside jokes) if one was involved in theater (which I&#39;m not).

I consider myself a huge horror movie fan. One night I wanted to just rent some newer horror movies to make fun of. Then, I rented Milo. I was so surprised by this movie. It scared the hell outta me. That&#39;s not something I can say very often. Usually Halloween only scares me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other friends watched it with me, and were left with a disturbed feeling. A good feeling, if you ask me, after watching a horror movie. If you are unaffected, then what&#39;s the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was original. It didn&#39;t follow the normal guidelines of a horror movie. That&#39;s why movies like Valentine bombed for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, many are left with unanswered questions, as most horror movies do. It is worth the rent though.

In 1990 I saw Kathy Ireland in person - I was at UNT in Denton during the filming of &#34;Necessary Roughness.&#34; Strangely enough, the voice she&#39;s using in this film isn&#39;t too far off from her real speaking voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the plot goes like this: Kathy gets a letter telling her that her father&#39;s fallen into a bottomless pit in Africa. She goes and investigates the site of her father&#39;s death, only to get sucked into a subterranean world that&#39;s part dystopian nightmare, part uninspiring fantasy, and inhabited by rejects from the Plasmatics. This movie really wastes the talent of Linda Kerridge, who, in my opinion, could have been someone had she gotten that one big role that was right for her. Anyway, the main hero of the story, Gus, is a very lame Mark &#34;Jacko&#34; Jackson rip-off. The original is annoying enough to begin with, but this guy really is torture to watch. Eventually the nebbish Wanda comes out of her shell and ends up wearing a bikini top and a sarong at the end. If you&#39;re going to have Kathy Ireland in a film in skimpy clothing, it&#39;d better be a bikini. Anyway, the film was just all around bad and rightfully skewered by MST3K.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this one if possible.

A movie this dumb should never see the light of day. The acting is lame, the violence is just all over the place, the sneaking ending is just plain stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s all about a lawyer who saw a murder done by the R.I.C.C.O. squad. No one has never seen him, not even the hit men themselves. So he and a beautiful lady are on the run trying to find the leader of this R.I.C.C.O. squad, before they find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the movie goes on to a romance, gun shooting, and voodoo. Now how in the hell did voodoo come in this. Never see this film if your life depends on it. Trust Me!!!!!!!!

I bought this DVD for my young son who loves the ToyStory movies. I never expected it to be in the same league as the Toystory movies but what I got was just another lazy Disney cartoon, way below what I expected from Disney/Pixar. The story is unoriginal, the characters are dull and two dimensional, the animation is below par, even Buzz isn&#39;t that great. The movie could have been so much better. I especially hated the paint by numbers storyline. I know it&#39;s meant for kids, but even kids know when something stinks to this level lameness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I did enjoy some aspects of the movie, I really liked the opening section of the movie, with the slag mutant monster, it just went downhill from there.

This esteemed production has it&#39;s fans. But to paraphrase the classic bad review of &#39;Mary Reilly,&#39; Moby Dick is like a painting, only slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is because the philosophical grounds for a movie &#34;production&#34; are never to make a great film, rather it&#39;s to substitute the lack of a strong guiding idea (in this case for a books transference to film) with a list of hopelessly atomized, undynamic but dazzling conceits in an effort to trick viewers into thinking they&#39;ve seen greatness. As viewers &amp; critics are apt to fall for this, Oscars follow, feeding the whole dumb equation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t share in the pleasure all these reviewers found. Moby Dick is stunningly uninvolving. Actors dutifully recite essays about Jonah, Moby Dick, the ocean, Moby Dick, Moby Dick... all things that can&#39;t respond, and not one of which is absorbing in the slightest. It&#39;s dramatically inert. It doesn&#39;t build. In narrative terms Moby Dick (as a movie) is little more than a foregone conclusion in search of an actual story. After half an hour I was muttering &#34;Oh terrific... another oath ...another 4 minute soliloquy!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the failed effort to involve you, it&#39;s a pretty campy overacting showcase. A lot of grey hair here. Starbuck is supposed to be a golden god. (!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One knows one is looking at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than trying to replicate the feel of someone else&#39;s paintings &amp; palette, or reverently embalming a classic as Huston does here. Paintings and books are nice but they&#39;re a different mediums. A movie like this fails to grasp that an honestly enjoyable piece of crap (Village of the Damned) is better in most respects than an insufferable piece of culture. This is the Eat Your Vegetables school of film-making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One appreciates the work that must have been done to make the movie, but not the narrative. Only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting; the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work &amp; various sea efforts; and the technology of whaling. And that doesn&#39;t call for a two-plus hour movie.

Believe it or don&#39;t, i have my very own DVD copy of this &#34;movie&#34; which i bought at Walgreens for a great big whole dollar. I&#39;m still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar foolishly wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty amazing set designs and costumes. Apparently much thought and effort went into their making. The set designs are very Mexican in stylization. I liked them a lot. And Santa is impressive. One of the more impressive Santas in moviedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience. But, somehow, it comes across quite deranged. In fact, i&#39;m left stunned at how deranged it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#39;s the English dubbing that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre. One of the reasons i prefer to experience movies in the original language they were made and the use of English subtitles as dubbing often gives an unintended strangeness. The kid voices were at least dubbed with actual kid voices as opposed to women pretending to be kids which tends to sound very, very weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns? You didn&#39;t? Neither did i until i watched this movie. One learns something new everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this movie actually worth watching? Now, that&#39;s a tossup. I can&#39;t in good conscience recommend it to anyone as it&#39;s quite disturbing in its own bizarre way. Yet, its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching. You decide what you&#39;re going to do. I dunno... for myself, it made me feel uncomfortable seeing demons constantly doing cutesy ballet moves. Now, that&#39;s just wrong...

Cassidy(Kacia Brady)puts a gun in her mouth blowing the back of her head out on boyfriend Neal(Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the lead singer of a &#34;demons and death&#34; rock band who couldn&#39;t shake the sad feelings of her boyfriend&#39;s neglect towards her(you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve this other than putting a bullet through your head). She returns, however, possessing the soul of Dora(Jill Small)her friend who is to replace her on vocals so that the group can finish the album halted by Cassidy&#39;s untimely death. But, Cassidy made a deal with the dark one and souls are to be collected..she&#39;s consumed by this anger towards mainly Neal, but all the band members or anyone within the music studio get dead when they fall prey to whom they believe is a rather distraught Dora..not Cassidy returning for payback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lousy micro-budget horror flick looks cheap, has a cheap cast who should make plans in another line of work, and boasts cheap kill-scenes which aren&#39;t effective one bit.

In the ten years since Wildside aired, nothing has really come close to its quality in local production. This includes the two series of the enjoyable but overrated Underbelly, which have brought to life events in the recent criminal history of both Sydney and Melbourne. The miniseries Blue Murder (which also starred Tony Martin, but as someone on the other side of the law) may be the exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wildside is currently being repeated late at night on the ABC. Having not watched the show in quite a while, I&#39;m still impressed by its uncompromising story lines and very human characters. The cast is excellent: Tony Martin as a detective haunted by the disappearance of his son, Rachael Blake (who later hooked up with Martin in real life) as a community worker struggling with alcoholism, and Alex Dimitriades as a young cop whose vice is gambling. Equally good support roles are provided by Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie herself), and a young Abbie Cornish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ABC inexplicably released only the first three episodes on DVD a couple of years ago. The logic of this sort of marketing is beyond me, but I&#39;m guessing it may have something to do with licensing disagreements with the original producers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great series which has aged remarkably well. Here&#39;s hoping the ABC&#39;s DVD department gets its act together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(According to a moderator on an ABC message board, some sort of further DVD release is due in December 2009)

Brilliant kung-fu scenes, loads of melodrama, peculiar footwear symbolism and an unhappy (?) end makes Barefoot Kid an unforgettable film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the silliest subtitles I&#39;ve seen...

As a zombie fan, I really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters! PB is also an excellent tie-in to Chronicles of Riddick (COR). The gang has to run as fast as they can away from darkness. There are so many metaphors in the story! Riddick is this bad guy, but he&#39;s also the hero who tries to save the slow-paced folks. The Muslim guy, Imam, relies on the sun&#39;s positions for the five times a day prayers, but he is stuck in a land where darkness will rule. Overall, I recommend this film to any sci-fi fans. You won&#39;t be disappointed.

The whole world is falling prey to a lethal disease, and rain never stops pouring down : nevertheless, in this atmosphere of nightmare, a man and a woman discover that they are neighbors, thanks to a hole in the floor of the man&#39;s apartment. They fall in love : at least, all would not have been lost. Although this wonderful film expresses the loneliness and the weakness of human being, there is also some room for hope, in the shiny singing scenes.

Enchanting, romantic, innovative, and funny. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled, exceeding better known &#34;death romances&#34; such as Ghost. While we know intuitively that Peter and June will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long-long stairway, the joy is in the journey. The moral of the tale, of course, is timeless: love conquers all. But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur. With more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors&#39; vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later, far into the CGI era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet for all the cosmic scale, Powell and Pressburger knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. The wonderfully, determinedly romantic aspect of &#34;Stairway&#34; is captured with ultimate simplicity: June&#39;s teardrop, preserved on a rose petal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film, like the story and the set itself, is one for the ages.

Thanks to the BBC for this show. I used to suffer from an inferiority complex, I hated leaving the house, talking to new people and I had an overwhelming sense that people hated me. However after watching one episode of 4 Non Blondes my fortunes started to change. After episode 2 I started applying for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes and I actually felt talented. When the series had finished I was running the sales department at work, banging a plethora of women and frequently won the karaoke competition down my local. If you ever have a confidence crisis and don&#39;t know where to turn then take a trip down to Poundland and pick up the DVD it&#39;s only 99p.

I thought it was a very funny movie. I love dog movies and comedy movies so combined they were twice as good. K-9, k-911, and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is hilarious and adorable they make a great team. The only downside is that i really didn&#39;t understand how Dooley&#39;s wife died. She died before this movie but how? If they said it i must have missed it. Other than that I give it two thumbs/tails up! Those dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have had A lot of training. They were so funny and all the noises Jerry Lee would make when Dooley was talking to him was so funny. my favorite was when Jerry Lee sang and when he would bite peoples privates to get information very very funny lol

A definite no. A resounding NO. This movie is an absolute dud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been recommended to me by a friend very much into &#34;that sort of thing,&#34; I watched this movie with some anticipation of being informed, changed, moved, altered, uplifted, and all the other positive mystical things that could happen to me when I suddenly see The Truth. Now this may sound like someone who is already predisposed to poo-pooing anything dealing with the metaphysical, the metaphysical/physical boundaries of existence. Believe me, I am not such a person. I try to be open about any presentation and then decide accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of content, the only thing I found mildly interesting and informative, was the bit about peptides, emotions, addiction, and cellular receptors. That was the only &#34;unifying&#34; element I could find in the documentary part of this film. The rest of the documentary rambled around several topics and never seemed to unify and cohere, try to tie up and conclude to a point. And what was all that stuff about native Americans not being able to see the ships that Columbus came in? Who told the &#34;authorities&#34; in this film that that was what happened in 1492? Where they there too? Had they compared this to scientific work being done in visual cognition (the famous gorilla video, for example, visit the Visual Cognition Lab at the University of Illinois site) there may have been a more convincing point made. Here, however, it seemed like unsupported mystical mumbo-jumbo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a film: this wasn&#39;t one film, it was two. I found the documentary part mildly interesting, just to hear the people talking about what they were talking about (I was annoyed that their credentials weren&#39;t presented at the bottom of the screen when they spoke, at least initially!) But I found the &#34;story&#34; part of the movie with Matlin in it annoying, disjointed, intrusive, non-related and downright stupid. That bit about the Polish wedding with that dance was not in the least bit funny. It was laughable, ludicrous, sophomoric, and stupid. And I found the use of the word &#34;Pollack&#34; offensive. It just seemed so out of place and wrong. Is such usage okay because a member of the group uses a pejorative term to refer to the group because he or she is a member of the group? That may be okay to make a point, but it didn&#39;t seem to be used that way here. And in any case, I don&#39;t care what the reason, it offended me, a Pole. I never call myself or refer to my ethnic background as &#34;Pollack.&#34; And I certainly don&#39;t like like it when others do. Can I watch or listen to a bigoted conversation in which this term is used? You betcha! But again this didn&#39;t seem to be the case here. It just seemed so out of place. Unprovocked, unmitigated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting was abysmal. Elaine Hendrix&#39;s performance was totally unbelievable. At times, it seemed like she was just reading her lines that had just been given to her. Marlee Matlin for the most part seemed to be sleep walking through this whole thing. Perhaps she was baffled by the material. I know I was. If she was supposed to be portraying a disillusioned drugged-up anxiety-prone malcontent, it just didn&#39;t seem to click. But by far, the world&#39;s worst was Hendrix! All in all, I found this a disjointed, poorly acted piece of clap-trap.

In short, this movie is completely worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early 1900s might think of the future. An interesting idea, but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief, so the idea just flops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed. But as a graphics person, the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening. The color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality. And I don&#39;t understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking. If anything, the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics -- they don&#39;t measure up even to the ancient Jurassic Park graphics. The models for the robots were so simple, plain and very uncompelling. There were a bunch of weirdo prehistoric-like animals on that island, but they are not explained in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is horrible beyond belief. In fact I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t just walk out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is unmotivated, and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception. Why is the Morris Paley character even there? We are not in any way convinced that Joe is heroic -- I mean he flies a plane, and saved one person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yeah there&#39;s a great hero for you. Dex has very little screen time, so why are we supposed to care about Joe wanting to save him? Who were the Nepalease that locked Joe and Polly in the mine vault, and why would they do it (remembering that the entire Totenkopf operation was robotic)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot holes: (1) Why did Bai Ling&#39;s character (a major fall from her excellent character in &#34;The Crow&#34;) halt the robots who had captured Joe? They were looking for the vials, and had not found them. (2) Why in the hell would Dex be captured but not killed (he doesn&#39;t have or know about the vials, and the bad guys didn&#39;t know that Polly had the vials and was connected to Joe and therefore to Dex)? (3) Polly indicates that &#34;they&#34; don&#39;t know anything about Totenkopf, yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete FBI-style file on him. (4) The blank spot on the map as described by the Nepalese -- if they know all about this mysterious area, then why the hell is their map blank in that spot? (5) At one point, Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes (they are burned) -- Joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes, yet Polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress, then in the same line of continuity suddenly Polly has her original clothes back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sigh*. How far off am I supposed to switch my brain to watch this crap?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music, even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the acting? We&#39;re supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad British accents? Which character isn&#39;t annoying? I think Ling Bai&#39;s dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie (she doesn&#39;t have a single line). The dialogue wasn&#39;t camp, and doesn&#39;t even rise to the level of cheese. Its just bad and annoying. These people aren&#39;t hero&#39;s or compelling; they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on IMDb. IMHO it should be competing with &#34;Batman Forever&#34; in the bottom 100 of all time.

I really enjoyed this movie for what it is: A funny little film that doesn&#39;t take itself too seriously. Plot summaries are available everywhere so I won&#39;t go into details. Michael isn&#39;t about a complex plot anyway. It just builds on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful road trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Travolta&#39;s performance as a chain-smoking, lady-loving, bar-brawling, pie-eating angel is just perfect. And who doesn&#39;t love Sparky?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch this if you want to have a few laughs and a overall good time. Highly recommended.

It&#39;s easy to forget, once later series had developed the alien conspiracy plot arc more, that once upon a time, The X-Files&#39; wrote episodes like &#34;GenderBender&#34; and &#34;Fearful Symmetry&#34;, where the aliens weren&#39;t all little grey men or mind-control goop, but could actually surprise you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Fearful Symmetry&#34; starts with an &#34;invisible elephant&#34; - actually an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time, not a mile away from &#34;The Walk&#34; - and ends with a pregnant gorilla being abducted. And it&#39;s very much an episode of wonderful moments. The subplot is annoyingly worthy - yeah, we get it, zoos are bad except when they&#39;re not - but the ideas that within it are fascinating, visually powerful, and very memorable, and it covers an angle on abduction that is largely overlooked - why *would* humans be the only things that aliens are interested in?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it wasn&#39;t an instant classic, but it was enjoyable viewing while it lasted, again, very memorable, and mainly, it&#39;s something that you couldn&#39;t imagine many other shows doing.

Guinea Pig: The Devil&#39;s Experiment is without a doubt ***** stars on first view, its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature. This movie gets right to the point, you may be thinking what point? The point is to satisfy fan&#39;s of just extreme violence and gore. This movie has some gore, more or less just torturing a women violently. There are really only 3 scene&#39;s that could be considered gore. I&#39;ll tell you one thing though Guinea Pig: The Devil&#39;s Experiment makes Hostile look like Sesame Street. If you thought Hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ain&#39;t seen the half of it until you&#39;ve seen Guinea Pig: The Devil&#39;s Experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Rating 0-5, Gore 0-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guinea Pig: The Devil&#39;s Experiment (Uncut) ***** (7)

As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film, I find it very interesting how few ,&#34;middle of the road&#34; comments there are. Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film. &#34;Why would you like a film that&#39;s so confusing?&#34; ask many of my associates. The answer is this: Forget the war, forget the brutality....This is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo. Brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done. They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the job, he does it too well, without adhering to the accepted &#34;standards&#34; of death and destruction (Am I the only one who&#39;s troubled by the fact that we have &#39;standards&#39; for death and destruction????), so they send the &#34;Conformity Police&#34; out to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm....Draw any parallels between this and things you see every day? With the deepest respect to Mr. Coppola, whom I believe is one of the best directors of all time, I think he transcended his original intent of the movie, and probably didn&#39;t even realize it until after the movie was released. The subtle sub-text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed; instead, it seems to have &#39;grown&#39; itself, like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. Again I must reiterate: I think FF Coppola did a bang-up job on this entire production, as did the cast and crew, but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten-fold. So if you haven&#39;t seen the movie, rent it, watch it, then watch it again, and maybe a few more times, and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. Only then make a judgment on the quality of the film. Those of you that have seen it, watch it again with the mindset previously described. I think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film. Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story-telling style!

Unreal &#34;movie&#34;, what were these people on?? A mix of French Upstairs Downstairs, mating horses,porn (not suggested, its pretty full on for a film) &amp; bestiality with a bit of Benny Hill music &amp; chase scenes thrown in, its sounds crazy &amp; its even more so to watch. **spoiler** It plods along in a tedious fashion for quite a while,.... then a Lamb does a runner, prompting woman in period dress to run off after it, she goes into the woods where she is set upon by an erect &#34;penis&#34; attached to a man in a bear/rat manky suit, I put it like that as its obvious the &#34;penis&#34; is in charge &amp; gets way too much screen time, ejaculating for the most of it, anyway, in a nutshell, it turns out she liked a bit of bear/rat tadger &amp; thats about it, the rest is just padding. **end spoiler** A film made to shock &amp; offend, thus getting talked about, any publicity is good publicity I suppose,a waste of time really, but the &#34;main event&#34; has to be seen to be believed, its hard to imagine that anyone thought it was a good idea as they filmed it.

I am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie... I have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though ive seen the &#34;making of&#34;, i still have doubts when watching those 35mins of pure torture : its that powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 10 out of 10 because this movie achieved perfectly what it set out to do : be the best fake snuff film ever made.

It&#39;s rare that I get the opportunity to review a film for IMDb that relates to my own life in such a close way. However, as someone living with cerebral palsy (albeit less severe than Michael, one of the main characters in the film) I don&#39;t wish to give this film a &#39;free pass&#39; just because it tackles a subject that&#39;s rarely approached; and when it is, is normally treated with po-faced seriousness. There WERE minor problems I had with the film; and I&#39;d like to address those first, so that people are clear that it isn&#39;t my situation which has clouded my judgement of this overall excellent film! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Parts of it I felt were unashamedly crowd-pleasing, at the expense of realism. If I had a pound for every time a well-meaning member of the public has mentioned electric-wheelchair racing to me, I&#39;d be much the richer man; but speaking personally, that fits more into the public perception of how we deal with our disadvantages, rather than the reality of what actually goes on. Same thing with spending time watching disabled people go to the pub - it&#39;s not a big deal to those of us who actually do it, as much as it might be admirable for outsiders looking in. I appreciate that this is from the previously sheltered perspective of Michael; but I still think he&#39;d be concentrating more on enjoying the experience, rather than reflecting on what a big deal it was that he was actually there, in the first place. As such, the amount of time we spend seeing them have fun felt like a bit too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I felt that the terminal nature of Rory&#39;s illness was brought to our attention far too late; meaning that it was just used as a cheap sentimental device to come between the pair, rather than something everybody knew all along was going to have to be dealt with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To balance those criticisms, I have to dish out a heap of praise, as well. Although I thought some scenes showing them getting to grips with normal life were a touch overdone; the script also ventured into some tricky places I wouldn&#39;t have expected, and comes out with a lot of credit for doing so. For instance raising the issue of love and relationships; and showing the daily apparatus often used to aid and assist the lives of non able-bodied people. Also, despite the blunt emotional shock tactic of death being sprung upon us, the movie as a whole is far less sappy than anyone has a right to expect these type of films to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brenda Fricker can and has been performing variations of her role capably on autopilot for what seems like years; but Robertson and McAvoy share a special interaction that must be noted. Inside, I&#39;m doing cartwheels that a group of people somewhere have finally made a film doing justice to the lust for life of many disabled persons.

I&#39;ve seen this film literally over 100 times...it&#39;s absolutely jam-packed with entertainment!!! Powers Boothe gives a stellar performance. As a fan of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981)I never thought an actor could capture the &#34;intensity&#34; like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles, until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones! As far as I&#39;m concerned, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones...this film captures his best performance!!!

The Ealing Comedies constitute their own specific sub-genre in the history of film. They were wry, droll reflections on British life in the late Forties and early Fifties. They are always amusing but I feel it is misleading to characterise them as comedies. They are breezy and good-humoured, rather than laugh-out-loud funny. However, the best of them are laced with understated satire and shot through with an occasional dark streak (epecially Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Ladykillers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an affection for all of them, but The Lavender Hill Mob is probably the one I have most difficulty with. Compared to the others, it seems somewhat perfunctory. To me, it is an outline sketch for a movie, but one that needed to spend a lot more time in development before it was ready to go before the cameras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything about it is a bit undercooked. For example, nobody is given any real context or background. Henry is simply a dutiful drudge, whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions go unrecognised, while Albert is a frustrated artist forced to prostitute his talent by making gift shop trash for a living. This establishes a motive for their crime, but nothing that subsequently happens is a consequence either of their characters or their plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other characters are introduced but play no real part in the story. The elderly resident in Henry&#39;s guest house could (with her love of detective stories) have been made an unwitting thorn in his side, but is merely used as background &#39;colour&#39;. Similarly, the various policemen who pop in and out of the action are simply there to keep the plot ticking along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, the movie is driven entirely by its contrived plot devices, which I find both frustrating and faintly irritating. The not-very-ingenious robbery is accomplished with minimal problems, despite Albert being prevented from carrying out his part in the plan (by Sidney Tafler&#39;s Clayton). The gold is then smuggled to France without mishap. Everything would have gone smoothly if it wasn&#39;t for a minor hitch, lamely based on the French pronunciation of the letter &#39;R&#39;, which results in six of the gold Eiffel Towers being accidentally sold to some English schoolgirls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leads to a series of frantic chases as Henry and Albert seek to retrieve them. These scenes are well executed, but at each point the conspirators are frustrated in their pursuit of the schoolgirls by a series of wholly factitious accidents. It is as if God is deliberately intervening to give them a hard time. This kind of plotting always has me grinding my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they finally track the last Eiffel Tower to a Police Academy exhibition and snatch it from under the nose of John Gregson&#39;s Police Inspector (why is he there, anyway?) all shreds of plot logic are abandoned. The final car chases are then simply filling up screen time until we are returned to the framing device with which the picture began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie doesn&#39;t even bother to tell us the fate of Albert (Stanley Holloway), Lackery (Sid James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This genial little caper has the professionalism of the Ealing team behind it, so it is far from being a bad movie. I suspect most viewers will find it considerably more enjoyable than I do (and why shouldn&#39;t they?), but I cannot help thinking there was a much better movie waiting to be made, if only more time and effort had been expended on fleshing out both the characters and the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the standards established by Ealing, Lavender Hill Mob is a missed opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: One curious footnote is that Audrey Hepburn gets a credit for her single line early on, but Archie Duncan remains anonymous despite his much more substantial contribution. I guess she just had a better agent.

With the advent of the IMDb, this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience. Why? Because users here who do a search on two-time Academy Award winner Glenda Jackson can find &#39;The Return of The Soldier&#39; among her credits. So can those checking out Oscar winner Julie Christie. Fans of Ann-Margret can give the title a click, as will those looking into the career of the great Alan Bates. Not to mention the added bonus of a movie with supporting heavyweights Ian Holm and Frank Finlay. Any movie with so many notables in it is rewarded by the IMDb, given all the cross-referencing that goes on here. So, why isn&#39;t this movie out on DVD? Don&#39;t the Producers realize the Internet Movie Database is a marketing gift for such a film? And &#39;The Return of The Soldier&#39; is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered. Get with it, people.

Shtrafbat - Penal Battalion is a moving, and mostly honest, look at the lives and deaths of Soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood during World War Two. One can almost call it the Russian equivalent of highly acclaimed &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; miniseries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formed in July of 1942 on the eve of Battle of Stalingrad, the penal battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrible casualties (sometimes as high as 90%). Prisoners of GULAG (political prison/concentration camps), deserters, soldiers who were captured by Germans but managed to escape, soldiers accused of breaching protocol, were all given a chance to join the Shtrafbat and prove that there were not &#34;Traitors of the Motherland&#34; with their lives. Those who sustained injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes of the law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This miniseries features a look at one such Shtrafbat, under the command of Tverdokhlebov - an honorable officer who was captured by the Germans, was shot and left for dead. It features a colorful and varied group of people, thrust into a situation from which there is no escape. The authoritative yet honorable crime boss Antip &#34;Kulak&#34; (The Fist) and his little gang of unreformed criminals, a young Jewish intellectual who struck his anti-Semite officer, Father (Orthodox Priest) Mikhail who joins the battalion when his parish is destroyed in the house-to-house fighting, political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the GULAG but who are nonetheless willing to fight one last time for their people and country, must all find their courage and their reasons to keep on living, and to keep on fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although set during a war, not every episode features combat, in fact what combat scenes there are, are often chaotic, sporadic, and short - which was probably the intent of the director. In between, the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast, their backgrounds, their thoughts and tragedies. The rape of a young woman by one of Shtrafbat&#39;s soldier and then his execution, execution for supposed AWOL, periods of boredom on the march, the celebration (and subsequent consequences) of finding a German bunker stocked with food (and champagne), the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors, cheating on a spouse, and other situations, feature prominently. The camera is unflinching - it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature, nor from raw human emotions. The dialog likewise does not censor out the swearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is superb and deep, and the script is likewise well written. Everything from rage, to weariness, to resignation, to finding a scrap of joy to hang on to, is rendered almost faultlessly. One complaint might be that some of Russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and culture. Because it is a history drama in a sense, some of the terms and situations (military rank, mention of other battles, certain historical references) may be lost on some viewers. This understanding is not needed to thoroughly enjoy Shtrafbat, but these references are a nice touch of authenticity. Another complain that could be levied, is an occasional anachronism and bending of history to suit the plot, but frankly this is such a riveting miniseries that one will likely forgive these slight mishaps.

This show is based on the concept that loud + obnoxious + repetition = funny. The comedic writing is non-existent, in fact I face serious repercussions by even comparing it to entertainment of any sort. Here is the premise. Two girls accidentally get their shenanigans posted on the internet and hilarity ensues after their initial success, they contrive the idea that they should make a web-cast to showcase their brilliance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so where should I begin? Let&#39;s start with the laugh track, the oft used but never successful reminder that, we the viewing audience should laugh. According to the foley guys, this show is the funniest thing on the planet. We should all be dropping loads into our pants because of the brilliance of the humor placed before us. The laugh track seriously goes every few seconds. It quite possibly usurps Scooby-doo for the king of laugh track over-use. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the in-your-face-shout-at-the-top-of-our-lungs-the-craziest-grouping-of- words-to-seem-silly trick is also employed with little to no success. Whoa and let&#39;s not forget creating new words to sound funny trick. That is web-o-licious and poop-tastic? What the hell... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the acting. I can&#39;t entirely complain here. The actors are young and inexperienced, but this should and can be corrected by good professional help. Because of the inexperience nick should be helping the actors define their craft. Instead, in usual nick fashion, the actors are placed in front of the camera and told &#34;act&#34;. Which for the most part is robotic recitation of lines, missed timing and overall epic fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of anything in this show makes it a disgusting representation of how not to be funny. Don&#39;t waste your time. This show is debasing to all of humanity

It&#39;s not a brilliant idea to watch Hundstage if you&#39;re not 100% sure of your mental stability, because it will be severely tested with this film no matter how sane you are. I have to say Hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment film, so the majority of the viewers wouldn&#39;t have the level of &#34;maturity&#34; to reach in to its delightful side. Kind of like Tarkovsky films, but different in a way. I, myself, can&#39;t say I had a lot of fun watching it. But it&#39;s an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the cliché that Hollywood offers. Hundstage sticks a finger right into your brain and scratches your mind all over. You can&#39;t simply sit back and watch it, you&#39;ll be using exclamations or looking with eyes wide open throughout the film. A film that&#39;s similar to this in style is Nachtgestalten, but it was considerably better, and way less violent. This one for instance, is not for children or those who are mentally tender or bad-tempered. Most viewers would most likely give either a 10 or a 1 to this film. I give it a 9 because I&#39;ve seen the multiple-stories-in-one-film phenomenon in another film and it was better. But this one&#39;s an outstanding piece on its own. Worth watching, but get ready to see something disturbing.

**********POSSIBLE SPOILER********** Madonna plays an ex-con that needs to recover some valuable information that might clear her from the murder that she was put in prison for four years ago. Griffin Dunne is a tax attorney who&#39;s marrying his boss&#39; daughter. Together, the two of them are supposed to come together in a world where chaos keeps you from getting on the bus...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get down to it, this is a stupid movie. Without trying to give away the plot ****POSSIBLE SPOILER****, the bad guys in the movie are trying to protect their boss by retrieving the information that would incriminate them for the murder that Madonna was sent up for. What kind of bad guys don&#39;t commit murder by trying to hide the original murder?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#39;s the cops who are trailing Madonna who follow the bad guys in a limo, where they have the brides-maids all tied up! And let&#39;s not forget those same brides-maids who fought from the front gate to the front door, still all tied together! And I hate to say this, but that patagonious feline sure looks like a cougar! There might be only four of them in the New York City area, so they might be endangered there, but I know there&#39;s plenty of them in the Rocky Mountains (see &#34;Charlie the Lonesome Cougar&#34; if you really want to see a large &#34;cat&#34; in the movie). And let&#39;s look at the old man who falls asleep on his feet... NAW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is there, but that&#39;s all there is to this movie. I was barely out of my teens when this movie originally came out and I was some-what of a fan of Madonna, but that was the only reason I liked the movie, but since then, she&#39;s fell out of popularity with me, and I&#39;ve faced the fact that she is just a terrible actress (good thing she&#39;s got that singing career to fall back on). It rated maybe a &#34;5&#34; back then, but it&#39;s fallen to &#34;barely making a 2&#34; over the years.

Wow! I&#39;m shocked to learn that it&#39;s a small world and that we are all interconnected. What a waste of 88 minutes. John Dunne put it much better in one sentence. &#34;No man is an island.&#34; The acting wasn&#39;t bad. The kids gave it all they had but at times the thread got so thin I couldn&#39;t follow it and the only real &#34;hero&#34; in the film ends up in jail after being tormented by a meter maid. I don&#39;t know. I just don&#39;t get it. Oh well.

I can&#39;t believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness. Of course, Brooks has not made a comedy about _real_ homeless people. No mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these streets. The people we meet in this movie are homeless in Fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they don&#39;t eat quite as often. Brooks&#39; movies have become worse and worse over the years. This is just another nail in the coffin .

Released at a time when Duvivier was going again from strength to strength .&#34;Black Jack&#34; which was sandwiched between the overlooked extraordinary &#34;Au Royaume des Cieux&#34; and the dazzling stunning &#34;Sous Le Ciel de Paris&#34; , is a jumble,which Duvivier himself hated,which is not surprising.There&#39;s almost nothing to write about this dud.We can notice that: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Orson Welles used to admire Duvivier .That may explain why Wellesian actors were featured in Duvivier&#39;s movies :Joseph Cotten in &#34;Lydia&#34; (1941) ,and here a totally wasted Agnes Moorehead .It&#39;s the first time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not enjoyed Moorehead&#39;s performance!On the other hand,Welles borrowed his Desdemona (Suzanne Cloutier) from Duvivier&#39;s &#34;Au Royaume des Cieux&#34; for his &#34;Othello&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.In any Duvivier&#39;s movie,there&#39;s one or two worthwhile sequences and this one is no exception: the search in the caves where Duvivier&#39;s sense of mystery works wonders (for a short while);then the chase when Dalio gets caught up in the fishnets.Duvivier&#39;s touch can be felt in the unhappy end too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the rest ,as my dear pen pal writer&#39;s reign writes,it&#39;s a black joke.

I watched the movie &#34;The Flock&#34; because of the casting of Gere and Danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting. This was one of the WORST movies I&#39;ve seen in a long while (and I&#39;ve seen some turkeys.) I&#39;ve never posted online before but this movie was so awful I had to do so. I suppose the problems begin begin with the script which was so amateurish it&#39;s unbelievable. The story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so trite it&#39;s nauseating. Poor Gere, he deserves so much better. As for the Gere/Danes on screen matchup, because of the horrible writing, one doesn&#39;t believe either character for a single minute. I&#39;ll bet Gere wishes he could buy back the negative, were such a thing possible. It&#39;s a shame to see talent wasted so badly, not to mention I wish I could get my 2 hours back. (I know what you&#39;re thinking. How do I really feel?)

OK, so this film is well acted. It has good direction but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years. The straight man &#34;deciding to be gay&#34; and the gay man &#34;Deciding to be straight&#34; I did enjoy it up until the last 20 minutes, after that i got really offended. As what usually happens in these films the straight actors play the main parts and the out gay actors play the secondary straight roles. The leads are played by handsome men but don&#39;t let that distract you from the fact that this is a a film that leaves you feeling unfulfilled. All the romance and relationships you hope would happen do not. Unless you are a priest that is in which case god bless straight woman who cure our homos.

Just watched this film on TV and it was awesome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;had just planned on watching it whilst doing some work however i ended up watching the whole film with out doing work as it was so good! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actors my not be very well know but the story line makes up for it. the fact that the actors make are less well known only makes it more believable that the events could occur. i did not feel a biased towards one character as i have no judgement of the types of character as i have never seen any of the actors in a film before which made it even more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would recommend watching it.

A chick flick that Guys still like - Yes! Wonderful. Now I can have fun, enjoy the company of my girl, and not feel like I can&#39;t wait until the movie ends! Light - but funny. Great stuff. What ever you do don&#39;t miss the DVD extras. This a great &#34;blind date&#34; file too. Will Smith does well in this - even though in is light acting - he pulls trough it all well. The movie is a little slow in pacing - don&#39;t expect too much action - the laughs are there - and so is the message - but the timing is a little slow. Use the low moments to whisper or kiss - it will pick up. The ending makes the feel good moments worth it. Most of all expect fun light hearted fare - and watch for some great upstaging by the supporting actors - they make the film. The plot twists are predictable - but it IS a date move, so get the refills of popcorn from the kitchen - and don&#39;t make her pause it. Count on more dates after this movie - she&#39;ll want o see what is next in line. Remember Hitch&#39;s advice!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.

The Christmas Secret was touted as a wonderful film, but I was truly disappointed. They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the film when it was over, which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project. As a screen actor myself I felt most of the performances were phoned in, although Beau Bridges, as Nick, did have a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas I would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume. It was an embarrassment. I had been a fan since his Waltons days, but have found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent work, so poor was this offering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In defence of the actors, the directing was stilted, mechanical, and thoroughly amateurish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic. I turned the movie on because it had a good cast and I was prepared to enjoy the film. However I would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back, even though it was on T.V.

Six months after high-school sprinter Laura dies during a race, a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons: that&#39;s the daft plot of early 80s slasher Graduation Day, a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style, originality or decent gore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does deliver, however, are some stunningly awful musical interludes, a few familiar faces (including an early appearance from scream-queen Linnea Quigley), and a smattering of nudity (a prerequisite of any slasher movie!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So forget the death scenesthey&#39;re lame and rather bloodlessand instead enjoy the movie&#39;s more memorably crap elements: the rapid editing that can induce migraines and epileptic seizures; the roller disco, which is accompanied by a prolonged heavy rock song, &#39; Gangster Rock&#39;, as performed by the unforgettably awful Felony; an impromptu jamming session by the school&#39;s students; Christopher George hamming it up as chief red-herring Coach Michaels; and the cheesy music teacher who letches after his female students (who, for some reason, find him quite irresistible?!?!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Towards the end of the film, the action picks up a little, with the discovery of the slaughtered kids&#39; bodies under the bleachers, and a quite twisted scene featuring Laura&#39;s corpse in her cap and gown, but it all comes way to late in the day to save this film from mediocrity.

THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A film based on a novella by Gerard Reve, that works best as a thriller. That&#39;s quite surprising, considering Reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Fourth Man&#34; is top-heavy on symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and I&#39;m never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way, he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline, and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In &#34;The Fourth Man&#34; he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there&#39;s plenty) but, as in most of his films, he seems afraid the audience wouldn&#39;t get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. There&#39;s hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity, most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face, it undermines an otherwise good story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, when you can cope with Verhoeven&#39;s pretty obvious satiric approach, it&#39;s quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round, Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbé in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camera Obscura --- 7/10

This animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs. evil plot and is all about action. What sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated. It was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around, her movements were done so well. Why don&#39;t they use this rotoscopic technique more these days? It&#39;s quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fire and Ice, in it&#39;s prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women, was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways, her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy. Some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy, others (including plenty of women) will adore it&#39;s esthetic quality. I for sure did not mind! Bakshi just loves animating lushious, voluptuous babes, as can also be seen in Cool World, and I don&#39;t think he has to apoligize since it&#39;s pretty much animation for adults. But I had also enjoyed this animation as a child and I never forgot it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was just special, so different from the standard Disney or Anime fare, and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it&#39;s possibly Bakshi&#39;s finest. For those who like animations with lushious women: try Space Adventure Cobra as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.

Prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films, and there&#39;s a good reason for that because it&#39;s not one of the best...but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer, this is certainly among the best of the lesser known/smaller films. The film does have some connection to blockbusters; for a start it&#39;s an early directorial effort for Renny Harlin; the capable director behind a number of action films including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and secondly we have an early role for Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen. The film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting. We focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years. This was the prison where a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison&#39;s governor. Naturally, the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace; and when the old execution room is reopened, the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is not exactly The Shawshank Redemption, but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror, the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base. This is a good job too because other than the basic premise, the film doesn&#39;t really have a &#39;plot&#39; to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting. The horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but it&#39;s never over the top, which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered, being released in a decade of excess. The murders themselves are rather good and imaginative, however, and provide some major highlights. As the film goes on, we start to delve more into the back-story of the vengeful convict&#39;s ghost and while it&#39;s fairly interesting, some things about it don&#39;t make sense and it drags the film down a little. Still, everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall I have to say that Prison is a film well worth tracking down.

This is a wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama. It is not really a horror flick so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to be internally consistent. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble or New Age revisionism. Rather than advancing an agenda, the filmmakers just told the story, told it well and let the viewer think about it. The sparse dreamscapes were reminiscent of Wyeth paintings and amazingly effective. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great example of how to make a good film on a small budget, without big studios, star actors, big-name directors (this was far better than many of Hitchcock&#39;s films), special effects or &#34;clever&#34; plot twists.

This comment discusses &#34;North and South Book I&#34; dealing with 1842-1861 period&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen. D.W. Griffith, in the early 1900s, made his unforgettable BIRTH OF A NATION. Yet, the most famous film about the north-south clash is still, I suppose, GONE WITH THE WIND (1938). Unfortunately, fewer people know the magnificent TV series based on John Jakes&#39; novel, &#34;North and South.&#34; It is the very best TV series ever made and the time spent on watching it is really precious. I taped it on my video from Polish TV many years ago and have come back to it with great pleasure many times since then. Why? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the entire story is deeply rooted in historical reality. The two families, the Maines from South Carolina and the Hazards from Pennsylvania, represent two entirely different ways of life. In spite of that, friendship unites them. Yet, what they experience is the struggle all people do: friendship attacked by &#34;truth&#34; of &#34;political correctness&#34;, love attacked by hatred of &#34;legal spouses&#34;, gentleness by strength of &#34;social heroes&#34;. Orry Maine (Patrick Swayze) is my beloved character - someone who finds love and who is quickly deprived of her; someone who cares for friends but political fanatics step in the way and ruin much. Finally, he is someone who can see the tragic future for his land but there is nothing he can do about the south&#39;s inescapable fate. His friend, George Hazard, is similar in most aspects but sometimes he appears to have a stronger character. It is him who shows Orry that although there are tragedies, he must get up from despair and live since life is the most precious thing we have. Although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendship occurs to be stronger than any prejudice, politics or conflicts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other characters are also particularly well developed. There are villains, like Justin LaMotte or Salem Jones who are really wicked but most of the people are ambiguous as the nature of humanity has always been. Charles Maine is, at first, full of rebellion, prone to fighting, later, however, he learns to be a true southern gentleman for whom southern pride is not courageous words but foremost courageous deeds. Virgilia Hazard represents the most fanatical side of abolitionist movement striving to condemn slavery and punish the owners of &#34;black breeding farms.&#34; Her marriage with Grady appears to be a symbol of equality but also a symbol of saying &#34;NO&#34; to the politics of the south. Two interesting characters are Orry&#39;s sisters, Brett and Ashton - sisters in whose veins runs entirely opposite blood. Brett, in her gentleness but also naiveness, believes in absolute fidelity. She marries Billy, even though he is a northerner, because she truly loves him. Brett is the representation of all that is precious in any young woman. Ashton, however, is a vamp, a tigress, a woman who does not hesitate to do the most wicked things. The clear picture of their world views clash is their chat about men and family...unforgettable moment and how universal! Most characters head for their values...yet, war breaks out and they&#39;ll have to put aside a lot...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the performances... someone said that not all people act naturally. I wouldn&#39;t say that. I&#39;d rather say that all cast do very good jobs in their parts from the main characters who are portrayed by younger staff to the guests that consist of famous stars, including Liz Taylor, Robert Mitchum and others. Patrick Swayze as Orry does a great job. I consider this role one of his best ones. Lesley Anne Down as Madeleine is also very memorable. Her part, perhaps, entails too much suffering but she manages to express all sorts of feelings really well. Kirstie Alley is very appealing and truly memorable as the abolitionist Virgilia Hazard. Phillip Casnoff is worth consideration as horribly ambitious Elkanah Bent as well as David Carradine as a monster husband, disgusting Justin LaMotte. And, in contrast to him, a mention must be made of Jean Simmons who is truly excellent as Orry&#39;s mother whose heart beats for the glory of family life and concord of union. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, memorable moments of &#34;North and South&#34; leave an unfading trace in one&#39;s mind. Who can forget the first meeting of Orry and Madeleine - what charm, what gentleness there is in this scene! Or is it possible to skip the moment when Madeleine&#39;s father dies? I found it really powerful, there is a real drama in this moment, a drama of a woman being left by someone who really loved her. I also liked Churubusco sequence and George Hazard so worried about the life of his dearest friend, Orry. Then his meetings with Constance are terrific. Virgilia&#39;s speech in Philadelphia is a masterpiece of performance. And the final moment of the first part: although North and South may separate, their friendship will never die. Orry and George symbolically join hands as the train moves on. Simply, there are so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it&#39;s impossible to mention even half of them here. And these gorgeous tunes by Bill Conti and shot in brilliant landscapes. The music in &#34;North and South&#34; is very touching and memorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to say in the end? &#34;North and South&#34; is a real must have on DVD, simply an amazing TV series about the victory of all that is precious in us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truthfulness, absolute fidelity. 9/10

Although the wonderful soda counter in the local drugstore no&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;longer exists, and the clothes are definitely l946 immediate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;post-war vintage, and good and evil are easy to understand, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;those old planes are really dated, this movie will never be dated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The human adjustments and problems post-war, the beautiful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love stories, the wonderful acting (especially Harold Russell and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dana Andrews) are as moving today in 2002 as they were in l946. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was one of the young women who welcomed our marvelous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;veterans home from World War II. Like so many, my memories of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the war years and the homecomings are as fresh today as if they&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;took place yesterday - this movie is very relevant for our times.

This film is, far and wide and beyond any shadow of a doubt, the single worst and most contemptible film in the history of the universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really *is* that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible film, and rented this one thinking it would be one of those. To my immense disappointment, it was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script is delivered in a way that sounds as if they&#39;re reading the lines directly off placards, the story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and the actual film looks like it was shot on a home video camera. I couldn&#39;t even finish watching it. It is even worse than &#34;Witch Academy&#34;, and that&#39;s quite a feat in itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot even begin to fathom how a director could shoot this film, and then still have the sense to believe it was decent enough to release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Painful, awful, horrendous.

If a movie can&#39;t hold your interest in the first 25 minutes, it&#39;s over as far as I&#39;m concerned. This concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense. A good movie has to start and end strong. It all seem interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise, but ultimately muddled and irrelevant. There are so many other movies from Asia to watch, many of which I am sure most of you have not seen, that I would really skip this one and look elsewhere. Why exactly does IMDb require a 10 line minimum for reviews? I said my piece and I hope this helps a few of you move on to the next film.

almost every review of this movie I&#39;d seen was pretty bad. It&#39;s not pretty bad, it&#39;s actually pretty good, though not great. The Judy Garland character could have gotten annoying, but she didn&#39;t allow it to. Somewhere along the line, i&#39;ve become a fan of brooding, overbearing, overacting Van Heflin, at least in the early 40&#39;s. Judy&#39;s singing is great, but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship. I gave it a 7.

Maléfique is a very interesting movie. It is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures. The central concept is great, three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth (who the audience identify with) and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The atmosphere is well-woven, it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of Edmond Dantes&#39; in the Château d&#39;If (prior to becoming the Count of Monte Cristo). The director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell, particularly the character we are meant to identify with (Carrère - a white-collar criminal whose crime is not specified, but it&#39;s obliquely suggested might be fraud). On one occasion Carrère dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him; we never leave the cell, the claustrophobia is unbroken. There are also no shots of the prison outside the cell, and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall. So even though the film appears to be very modern, it has a very old world feel of incarceration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are intriguing. We have Marcus, a violent pre-op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to Pâquerette (French for Daisy) a heavily retarded young man. Pâquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful, and unfortunately this included his baby sister, hence his current predicament (I like this comment on internalisation, very primitive). Lasalle is a withdrawn, possessed elderly man, in for brutally murdering his wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you, and there&#39;s a ritual that goes with that. I think that&#39;s what disturbs me the most, seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically. It has a real life ring to it. The quite simple soundtrack backs this up well, every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong. I&#39;m actually hearing the gong now every time I do something self-destructive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don&#39;t really reinforce the message consistently, particularly with Carrère, also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film, not in terms of a successive revelation either. I also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish, more by design than execution, such as the famous &#34;vagina eye&#34;, and the sodomy of Lasalle, for me, totally hollow images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with, and some things don&#39;t seem logical, for example we&#39;ve been clumsily led to believe different things about Carrère&#39;s child. This doesn&#39;t change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird, a &#34;pure&#34; horror movie. There is no comedic dross or genre segueing, like Cube (1997/Natali), the obvious movie to compare it to, it&#39;s a total immersion experience, where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters. This last comment I make about it being a &#34;pure&#34; experience I think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a personal note my favourite part of the film is when Lasalle talks about his past as a librarian. He very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him. The books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge. This prompts Lasalle to go insane. That really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge. It&#39;s something I myself have felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final comment is that two of the quite well-received comments on the board have confused the characters&#39; names. To convince yourself that Lasalle is the older librarian character, simply click on Philippe Laudenbach&#39;s page and you will see he was born in 1936.

An example of genius filmaking. The epic story of three major stages of life for a young boy told with eloquence and raw fearlessness. Rarely does a film come along that causes me to out loud say during most of the viewing, &#34;this is a really good film....&#34; again and again. That is exactly what happened when I watched this film. I really do not understand how anyone could not like it. I found myself at moments crying and laughing at the very same moment, unable to control how I felt about the scene. The acting is outstanding. Eric Mabius- why is he not all over movie screens? He was really extraordinary. His seemingly effortless attempt on the screen impacted me in deep visceral ways. I thank him. In my opinion, Eric Schaeffer is one of the best filmakers around, and I hope he continues to rise to the challenges that he faces while trying to give us art in the face of ferocious commercial filmaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I have watched this movie three times. The last time, I kept skipping around confusing scenes to find resolution for the plot. Perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together logically. Or perhaps these rough spots are in the plot because Ann&#39;s recall of distant events is rather faulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who has attended an unnamed college with the scions of a rich family. She must have had help to afford this very expensive education, but never seems to have any family ties at all. She never seems to have any relatives she can turn to when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions take effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann shares an evening of passion with her great love Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). Then, when Harris comforts Lila after the tragic death of her brother Buddy, Ann suddenly finds him repulsive and is disgusted with her own behavior. I must have missed something significant here. Ann&#39;s behavior seems totally inexplicable. Ann abandons her relationship with Harris and eventually marries one of the groomsmen at Lila&#39;s wedding. Despite Ann&#39;s rejection of Harris, she continues to hold deep feelings for him on her deathbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was obvious from his behavior that Harris was deeply smitten with Ann and would have gladly married her. A scene showing their chance meeting years after Lila&#39;s wedding showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Ann.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film showed a pattern for Ann&#39;s romantic relationships. She always had a falling out with her men and she rejected them. This pattern held with Harris and two husbands. In contrast, Lila married a man she did not love and she remained with her husband until he died. Perhaps Lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came the too convenient reappearance of Lila Ross at Ann&#39;s bedside. Apparently Ann&#39;s nurse was able to extract enough information from Ann&#39;s last few lucid moments to identify and contact Lila. None of this communication appeared on the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept wondering about the house Ann was living in during her final days. How did she afford to buy such a house on the meager earnings of her singing career? Ann always seemed one step ahead of financial disaster while raising her two daughters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another level, I enjoyed the film&#39;s setting and music immensely. The seaside mansion was just so heartbreakingly beautiful. Claire Danes was luminous as the young Ann Grant. She is really quite a talented singer. I much prefer her natural brunette to the bottle blonde look she had in the film extras. If only those pesky CGI fireflies would go away, I could raise the movie a whole point in my vote!

Absolutely the worst experience I have ever been through. I think my eyes started bleeding. I actually got sick the night after watching this. I don&#39;t even consider this a movie. Movies are supposed to be worthwhile and entertaining. This fails horribly. I could not make it through the entire film, so because the ending could be greatest phenomenon in motion picture history, this gets a 1 for that small chance. Otherwise It would be a flat 0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t see how National Lampoon, or let alone any organization, would sponsor this atrocity. Renting this DVD is currently one of the worst mistakes of my life. Only watch this if you want to make ever other movie you will ever watch seem great. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without question this is the worst movie I have ever seen.

This movie starts out the way every movie should start out, with a bunch of hot babes in a dorm walking around in their undies and/or topless. A couple of them take showers. I&#39;m liking it so far! Unfortunately, we then meet or main characters. They&#39;re just not particularly likable. Usually in these movies, the actresses aren&#39;t really acting, they give very &#34;natural&#34; performances, and they&#39;re quite sympathetic, fun, and likable. Not here. They don&#39;t have much of any personality and I didn&#39;t care for them much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the girls go on a camping trip for school. On the way they stop at a backwoods gas station and meet a biker gang. The biker gang should really have been left out of the movie - it was cheesy before, but now it&#39;s just plain stupid. The head biker looks like a middle aged guy dressed up as John Bon Jovi for Halloween. The girls go out to the woods and later the biker gang follows them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t really know what the heck happens after that. There&#39;s a bunch of stuff about the world ending because it&#39;s the end of the millennium, then some of the bikers get killed by a mysterious Indian dude who keeps disappearing. Somebody gets eaten by a cheesy Lock Ness Monster thing as he&#39;s swimming across a lake. Some guy in silly makeup is apparently a Druid, and he needs to sacrifice some of the girls in order to forestall the end of the world. Or maybe cause the end of the world, I&#39;m afraid I wasn&#39;t paying much attention. First he dresses the girls up in animal skin lingerie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could have been a really fun cheesy movie, but the biker gang kind of ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so scatterbrained that it didn&#39;t even live up to my grade Z schlock expectations. They really should have eliminated half the plot elements and just focused on one or two things. Instead it&#39;s all over the place. Overall, if you&#39;re looking for late &#39;80 schlock, I imagine you could do worse. If you tried really hard. There&#39;s plenty of nudity at the beginning, but the characters are kind of crummy and the plot is too nonsensical to be even the least bit satisfying.

Committed doom and gloomer Peter Watkins goes slummin&#39; across the pond to take on the American justice system circa 1971 with this priceless piece of zeitgeist paranoia that leans so far left it falls over constantly. Watkins is pure tourist as he assembles this our gang tragedy with cliché freaks, hippies and black revolutionaries pitted against trigger happy cops and military and a kangaroo court tribunal made up of disapproving calcified adults making poor fashion statements. Talk about a revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Punishment Park we have radical youth versus corrupt system as dissenters convicted of crimes are given the choice of imprisonment or a three day trek across Punishment Park (Death Valley) and freedom. Of course the law enforcement officials monitoring their journey aren&#39;t about to play fair and combined with the stifling heat the fate of our protagonists looks sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punishment Park has elements of Kafka in setting as well as theme. Trials are held under a large canvas tent where shackled prisoners shout defiance at a hardcore love it or leave it group of inquisitors (such as members of Silent Majority for a Peaceful America) who snarl back. Neither group spends much time listening to the other and the proceedings sometime takes on a teen parent battle over the keys to the car look. Mostly its just one side saying what&#39;s wrong with America the other saying what&#39;s right with no one offering solutions for change. Meanwhile the Punishment Park martyrs stumble endlessly about the dessert while cops with guns act like twelve year olds. It kind of has the look and feel of some of my 70&#39;s college film making class when we were younger and knew more then than we do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Watkins has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he perceives as a corrupt powerful few. Culledon was a strong indictment of military atrocity in 18th century Scotland that still resonates. War Game is a raw sobering look at nuclear aftermath that should be required viewing for all. Punishment Park has its value as well but for other than intended reason. Watkins vision today is a textbook example of the left in full tilt counter culture 70s paranoia and given the times ( Vietnam, Kent State, The Chicago 7) such strident hysteria seemed not that great a distance from the truth. But 35 years later the fever has subsided and Punishment Park with it&#39;s unrestrained narrow viewpoint is a pretty silly ride.

This is fairly typical for the Sci-Fi Channel: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot, and terrible special effects. We&#39;ve got some alien sock puppets loose on a train, and Lou Diamond Phillips does his best with what little he&#39;s given to eke out a performance. And save the day. Everyone else in this is utterly dispensable; the ex-wife who goes through the time-honored cliché of first disliking Lou, then of course comes to love him again at the end. The obnoxious State Senator who gets munched early on, and a gaggle of dull security guards who run around a lot. Then there&#39;s an eco-terrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever, except to provide us with 3% more running around. He spends the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The special effects really deserve their own paragraph. We start with a meteorite that flies through the air, trailing flames behind it, at about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this movie, if you exceed the posted speed limit in your car, atmospheric friction may cause you to burst into flames. Then it lands on the hood of a car, coming in horizontally. Sort of like a velcro ball landing on a velcro floor I guess. It really doesn&#39;t damage the car much, just bends up the hood a little bit. Later on Lou gets in a helicopter and goes chasing after the train. Even though the train only had a two minute head start, it takes a good half hour to catch it. The CGI is so bad that the helicopter looks like it&#39;s as big as the hills it&#39;s flying over. Then it flies into the side of a mountain - this effect must be seen to be believed. It looks like they took a jar of gasoline and threw it against a wall, then superimposed the flame effect over the helicopter. About 10 times too big. No wonder the helicopter couldn&#39;t pull up in time, it was carrying five tons of nitro glycerine. Then the eco-terrorist eventually blows himself up, but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions do, he explodes upwards like a cannon aimed into the air. Then there&#39;s the whole deal with not being able to stop the train because that would allow the little aliens to get off, but it appears that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling, so why this would keep them on the train I have no idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#39;ve got a couple of hours that absolutely need killing, and it&#39;s down to this movie or reruns on the Food Network, well, come to think of it, some of those chefs are kind of cute. Usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them; maybe there&#39;s a sexy girl, some T&amp;A, or a character that actually has some personality, or some suspense or, well, something. I really didn&#39;t see any of that here.

This turned out all right and looks interesting. However, as it goes on the attempts at creating emotions between the characters is so inept that it really turns the horror off and is an insult to serious viewers. The story this is based on &#34;I walked with a zombie&#34; is probably much better although unfortunately I haven´t seen it yet. &#34;Ritual&#34; looks so exciting and could have been a great movie about zombies and voodoo but in reality it has turned out very poorly which is a shame. It´s hard to say what is wrong with it. I guess there are just too many inept scenes and it is hard to believe, for example, in the lovestory between Alice (who is called Alice Dodgson like the girl who supposedly inspired Lewis Carrol to call his heroine Alice) and the younger brother. Absolutely nothing has been built up between them and then in the end they get married. Anyway, this looks great, and it was worth a look - but the movie is just so poorly performed. 3/10.

This movie features several well known actors which I usually like, so I had at least modest expectations when I rented this on DVD. I was highly disappointed. In fact I walked off for some snacks somewhere during the last half hour and somehow I ended up in the kitchen rather then going back to the TV. The actor performances where poor pretty much all across the board and none of the atmospheres in the movie felt very convincing. Virtually all scenes had that &#34;just a movie&#34; feeling to them, I just sat there waiting to hear the director calling &#34;CUT!&#34; followed by the crew having a little chat about the scene before moving on to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the movie is about gangsters most characters are tough and mob-like, the problem here is just that this whole bad-boy attitude is played out so poorly that it just feels like a joke. The constant guitar-drilling soundtrack really tries to emphasize this atmosphere too, but when the same track is played the 18th time it just adds to the already strong feeling of the whole thing just being fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was just a really really bad script, maybe it was just poorly executed. I&#39;m no movie critic, in fact I consider it rare to see something that&#39;s REALLY good, but this was just plain bad no matter how objective and forgiving I&#39;m trying to be. NOT recommended, not even as a rental!

Absolutely one of the worst movies I&#39;ve ever seen! &#34;The Beginning&#34; was not the greatest either but better than this one. This is not a good way to lead up to the original movie. It&#39;s just simply awful! The CGI hyenas were so fake looking in both movies! Why not use real animals? I enjoyed the old Sinbad movies better than this. I was royally disappointed! The only good thing I can say about this waste of film is the cinematography and clothes which really captured that era well. I understand why this movie was redone as &#34;The Beginning&#34;. It&#39;s just that bad, in my opinion. where does the money come from to waste like this? Give me a multi-million dollar budget and I&#39;ll show you how it should be done!

This review is based on the dubbed Shock-o-Rama video released on an undeserving world in 2002. How bad is it? It&#39;s awful, which is what a &#39;1&#39; represents on the IMDb scale--but it&#39;s much worse than that. It&#39;s nice to imagine that an original German-language print might improve matters--the comedic English-language dubbing isn&#39;t funny at all--but truthfully, this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre you&#39;re likely to see. The zombies in the film are as slow and clumsy as ever, and they don&#39;t seem to have the ability to speak or think about anything beyond their next meal. However, they&#39;re also intelligent enough to operate chainsaws and malicious enough to know that western taboos about genitalia will no doubt enliven their dinner table conversation. George Romero&#39;s Land of the Dead posited a zombie nation that retained a shred of social coherence; here, zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imaginings of director Andreas Schnaas. Utterly without redeeming social value, and even worse, entirely lacking as entertainment, Zombie &#39;90 is a bad joke on anyone who wastes money on it.

AWWWW, I just love this movie to bits. Me and my cousins enjoy this movie a lot and I am just such a HUGE FAN!!! I hope they bring the TV series out on DVD soon. Come to mention it, I have not see the TV show in a LONG time. Such geart times! Where I come from Australia The Chipmunk Adventure is only known by people in their late teens and adult years which is kinda sad because the young kids don&#39;t know what there missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The songs in this film are ace the ones I love the most Boys/girls of rock n&#39;roll, Diamond Dolls and the song that ls sure to make you want to cry My Mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is sure to excite both young and old GET THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE TODAY!!! 10 out of 10, such an excellent movie.

People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup. She injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season corrupted by the devil&#39;s evil magic. Fonda aside the acting was not what we have come to expect from Hollywood, which I think is a good thing since Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to train its acting talent to portray roles and so they have become stale and reliant on CGI and other special effects to take us away from the actors who all use the same tricks on us. Instead it shows new ideas some real thinking on the part of the actors about how they can find new variations on the the old themes of love and danger.

Wow, what a strange film. It&#39;s a David Lynch movie so it&#39;s no surprise that it is weird. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film. I can&#39;t be done. After some research following my second viewing of this film, I pretty much know most of the story but on a first look, and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help, it is hard to figure things out. So, if you&#39;re in that boat and was confused, don&#39;t feel bad; that&#39;s normal. Let me just say the key to the film is Naomi Watts&#39; character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I find the film fascinating. I love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch. The camera-work is excellent and the music is creepy, a la Lynch&#39;s &#34;Blue Velvet.&#34; There also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. In all, it&#39;s very well scored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Lynch&#39;s &#34;Twin Peaks&#34; television series, this was a film in which the end was pieced together afterward since Lynch thought this film was going to be a long, drawn-out TV series. When that didn&#39;t happen, he pieced at the last minute this ending. That may account for some of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations concerning characters we see earlier in the film but who mysteriously disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theme of the story, supposedly, is a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Watts and the other leading lady, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene. Looks- wise, both women were chameleons, looking average at times, stunning at other times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first. It&#39;s not just a curiosity piece; it&#39;s a very intriguing movie.....just don&#39;t feel stupid if you can&#39;t make sense of a few things.

Catherine Brreillat is a French director who loves to provoke her audience. She takes us along to witness how a film is done on location. The movie in production seems to be based on herself, since the person at the center of the story is Jeanne, a woman director, much like Ms. Breillat. Jeanne acts as the alter ego of the real director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeanne reaches an impasse at the start of filming. Not only has she picked the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold spell, as it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras. Jeanne has problems with the two principal actors, especially, the male lead who has problems accepting the way the director has decided to show him in the movie; the lead actress is no angel either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie making, Ms. Breillat tells us is a process like no other in a creative work of art. First, there is the writing period, in which, in this case, Jeanne, has written a screen play, that when it goes into production reveals problems the writer/director didn&#39;t think about. There is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the young woman of the story has her first sex contact. What appeared clever in the written page, doesn&#39;t necessarily translate into an easy time in front of the camera. The actor is made to wear a false penis and has a lot of problems accepting the fact that a make up has to touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The luminous Anne Parillaud is marvelous as Jeanne, the director. She makes observations about the production, the actors, and the crew that fit well into the story being told. Gregoire Colin and Roxane Mesquide play the lead actors, with all the insecurity that some actors bring to a movie set. Jeanne has to massage their egos in order to get what she wants in the end. Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, Jeanne&#39;s assistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Sex Is Comedy&#34; allows Ms. Breillet to give us her own take on films in general. This is a great look at the way movies are done in a typical Breillat style.

Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV&#39;s &#34;Land of the Lost&#34;) creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S.; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair. Moreover, the game cast mug it up with infectious aplomb: the adorable Valerie Bertinelli as Brian&#39;s sweet fiancé Casey Norton, Chuck McCann as klutzy crook Brooks, Red Buttons as McCann&#39;s equally bumbling partner Bracken, Jim Backus as evil CEO Mr. Gibbs, Hermoine Baddeley as nice old biddy Ms. Foster, and 60&#39;s AIP exploitation feature regular Larry Bishop as smarmy, duplicitous suit Ken Sharp. Best of all, the titular pooch is a cuddly delight: C.H.O.M.P.S. jumps through fences, walls and windows with amazing agility, performs acts of exceptional strength, runs faster than a deer, and even does a few nifty martial arts moves. A subplot about a hulking neighborhood hound named Monster supplies a few extra belly laughs (Monster is voiced by some uncredited guy with an appropriately deep, growly voice). The groovy animated opening credits sequence, Charles F. Wheeler&#39;s glossy cinematography, and Hoyt Curtin&#39;s funky, pulsating disco score are all solid as well. A cute little kiddie flick.

I was very impressed with this film. I would have to rate it as one of the better classic-era westerns. I say that for the whole thing: the acting, mature dialog, no- nonsense story and excellent cinematography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Anthony Mann, who did several well-photographed film noirs around this same era, also made some westerns such as this one. It has that same film-noir look. Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period. . If you like this movie, I recommend the Mann-Stewart film &#34;Bend Of The River.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, the story is about a man, &#34;Lin McAdam,&#34; (Stewart) who owns this prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won fair-and-square in a contest. It is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain. All of those villains are interesting characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aiding Stewart act out this interesting tale are Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. All of them are fun to watch. It was a bit of a stretch, however, to see Rock Hudson playing an Indian (&#34;Young Bull&#34;), but you can&#39;t have everything.

Jennifer Egan&#39;s novel was brought to the screen by Canadian director Adam Brooks in a film that, based on some comments from contributors to this forum, sounds a bad proposition, but in fact, it&#39;s much better than one is led to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a story about two sisters who loved one another dearly. Faith, the fair headed and happy-go-lucky hippie girl, takes her younger sibling, Phoebe, under her wing. Phoebe plainly loves Faith; when the older one decides to follow her boyfriend Wolf to Europe on a summer vacation from Berkley, she promises she will send Phoebe a post card every day. Faith does that, until the cards stop coming in and one night, some time later, the family receives a phone call to inform them Faith has died under tragic circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phoebe can&#39;t forget Faith. That is why after some years pass by, she decides to take the same route the older sister took. She takes the cards from Faith and visits each place, starting in Amsterdam, then moving on to Paris and she wants to end up the trip in Portugal, where Faith encountered her untimely death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Paris, Phoebe hooks up with Wolf, who by now, is not a hippie anymore and is living with his girlfriend. Wolf, tries to persuade Phoebe into abandoning her trip and to go back home; she suspects that Wolf holds the key into solving the mystery, and as she is going to depart for Portugal she makes a discovery when she finds a picture that clearly contradicts Wolf&#39;s version he has told Phoebe. He feels guilty and, against his girlfriend&#39;s wishes, decides to accompany Phoebe to the town where Faith died. The story changes at this point and we go back in flashbacks to what Faith experienced in Europe and what happened in her final days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing in &#34;The Invisible Circus&#34; are the performances of the principals, something that Mr. Brooks has to take the credit for. The big surprise is the range of Cameron Diaz, who, as Faith, seems to select light comedy parts, when she is quite able to do good dramatic work under the right director. Jordana Brewster is seen as the older Phoebe and makes a wonderful contribution to the film. She is a stunning beauty with what seems to be a naturalness for acting. Christopher Eccleston is Wolf and shows he also is capable of doing more serious drama. The sweet Camilla Belle plays the younger Phoebe quite convincingly. Blythe Danner appears as the mother of the girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The European locations are gloriously photographed by Henry Braham. The film is also enhanced by the musical score of Nick Laird-Clowes and Petra Haden&#39;s original song. Elizabeth Kling edited with great elegance. Ultimately, this film shows Adam Brooks in great form as he gives the right tone to the adaptation of the novel and gets rewarded by having the right cast doing wonders for him.

I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing. Everything about this movie seemed to click, the storyline, the characters, the setting. As far as film is concerned I wouldn&#39;t call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic. It gets it&#39;s meaning across. The cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O&#39;Neil are hilarious. For this who haven&#39;t seen it, I will give you a brief synopsis: Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose. The film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can&#39;t stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you to see this movie.

This film is truly a sorry excuse for film making. The pacing is poor, the budget must have been depressingly low, and the acting is cut-rate (that is, except for Bela Lugosi). The audio at this point in time is also terrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as though a jet were taking off for the entirety of the movie. If these things bother you at all, don&#39;t watch this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get past this, however, you will find that the idea behind the film is a very good one. A German plastic surgeon (Bela Lugosi) was hired by the Japanese to operate on several Japanese agents and turn them into the likenesses of upstanding American businessmen whom the Japanese have kidnapped and killed. After completing his work, he was betrayed by the Japanese and thrown into prison. He later escapes and travels to America to seek revenge on his patients through a series of highly-publicized murders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed as though Bela Lugosi was the only decent actor in the film, and, to be honest, the rest of the actors were completely forgettable and stodgy. The leading actress ended up being rather boring and stereotypical, while the police officer assigned to her case was the common, chauvinistic and always correct dominant male that is found in many films of this time period. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that the camera work was completely uninspired, often taking the exact same angles of the exact same rooms time and time again. After a while, this tends to drag the film down, setting a very slow pace for the &#34;action,&#34; which is more or less non-existent anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, the idea is a fascinating one, and with a better writer, director, script, equipment, and actors it could become an excellent film. Sadly, these handicaps keep the film back for now, and I can&#39;t recommend it to anyone but the most open of movie lovers.

This movie is really nerve racking Cliffhangin movie!Stallone was good as always!Michael Rooker put on a surprising performance and John Lithgow play a excellent villain!The music is fantastic especially the theme!The movie is action packed and never dull!If you are a Stallone fan then watch Cliffhanger,you won&#39;t be disappointed!

This film is a study piece for my english class, but it&#39;s depth and meaning has amazed me. Since we&#39;re looking closely into all the facts and characters in this film, its and interesting tale of love, hate, war, and prejudice. Well Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Story: A girl named well-off jewish Patty Bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war, she then hides him in her playhouse in her huge gardens, and as they get to know each other, they begin to see the others qualities, and they earn each others love. Patty&#39;s father despises her and treats her like dirt. Anton (the prisoner of war) almost blows his cover to protect her, but patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone.

With the runaway success of &#34;God&#39;s Army&#34;, every Mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now. In the case of the recent &#34;The Other Side of Heaven&#34;, this wasn&#39;t at all a bad thing. That film, while not great, was quite good. &#34;The Singles Ward&#34;, however, is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Telling the story of a young, divorced Mormon guy thrust back into single life, the writing and shooting style of &#34;The Singles Ward&#34; is, in many ways, very similar to the 80s comedy &#34;Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off&#34;. However, the similarities end there. While &#34;Ferris Bueller&#34; was funny, original, and well-acted (as far as stupid comedies like this ever are), &#34;The Singles Ward&#34; is completely the opposite. It tries very hard to be funny. However, 90% of the gags either fall flat or are cliches and jokes you&#39;ve probably heard a million times before. The other 10% seem to be thrown in to fill out the time. And the acting, while not awful, is amaturish at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, if you&#39;re not either a Mormon yourself, or very, VERY familiar with Mormon culture, you won&#39;t get hardly anything at all. Whereas &#34;God&#39;s Army&#34; and &#34;The Other Side of Heaven&#34; were appealing to a broad range of viewers, both inside and outside of the Mormon church, this film is most definitely one big inside joke, and even if you get it, it&#39;s just not that funny.

A sophisticated contemporary fable about the stresses that work to loosen and ultimately unbind the vows of marriage. The main thrust of the narrative arises from a &#39;homily&#39; spoken by a country priest following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. In it, the future course of the marriage is spelled out, which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life. The &#39;moral&#39; of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out, both now, and in the past, it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends. This film was a relative blockbuster by domestic Italian standards. It&#39;s a terrible shame that this film is not available in either DVD or VHS.

I thought I was going to watch another Friday The 13th or a Halloween rip off, But I was surprised, It&#39;s about 3 psycho kids who kill, There&#39;s not too many movies like that, I can think of Mikey, Children Of The Corn and a few others, It&#39;s not the greatest horror movie but it&#39;s a least worth a rent.

Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana, a high school girl with an insolent scowl and 2 x 4 on her shoulder. She&#39;s ready to battle anyone, especially her father who is paying for her brother&#39;s boxing lessons. Diana decides boxing would be a good way of focusing her anger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent. Watch how their emotions towards each other are shaped by the squared circle.

**** Spitfire (1934) John Cromwell ~ Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Young &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mountain hillbilly Katharine Hepburn (as Trigger Hicks) is a religious back-woods laundry woman. &#34;Going on 18&#34;, she begins to attract male attention, and responds by throwing rocks. The arrival of a dam-building construction crew triggers dreams of romance in Ms. Hepburn. She quickly attracts the attention of suave engineer Robert Young (as John Stafford), who flirtingly hides his marital status. Supervising engineer Ralph Bellamy (as George Fleetwood) is also interested in Hepburn, but for different reasons; Mr. Bellamy wants to know more about Jesus Christ, whom Hepburn worships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Hepburn employs the power of prayer to heal a child, neighborhood folks suspect she is a witch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it weren&#39;t so serious, &#34;Spitfire&#34; might be more amusing; it is an atypical and wildly inappropriate vehicle for its star, who is thoroughly unconvincing. Of the leads, Mr. Bellamy performs best. However, the best characterization is essayed by Sarah Haden (as Etta Dawson), who appeared in George Cukor&#39;s stage version, along with Louis Mason (as Bill Grayson). Will Geer (as West Fry), &#34;Grandpa Walton&#34; in the 1970s, has a small role. An unexpected ending helps.

Belmondo is a tough cop. He goes after a big-time drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, normally a great villain - see &#34;Sharky&#39;s Machine&#34;; but here he is clearly dubbed, and because of that he lacks his usual charisma). He goes to the scuzziest places of Paris and Marseilles, asks for some names, beats up some people, gets the names, goes to more scuzzy places, asks for more names, beats up more people, etc. The whole movie is punch after punch after punch. It seems that the people who made it had no other ambition than to create the French equivalent of &#34;Dirty Harry&#34;. Belmondo, who was 50 here, does perform some good stunts at the beginning; apart from those, &#34;Le Marginal&#34; is a violent, episodic, trite, shallow and forgettable cop movie. (*1/2)

Definitely worth watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten different directors each present a segment based on their favorite opera aria. You don&#39;t need to be an opera lover to watch this film. (Although, of course, if you hate opera, you&#39;re really going to have a bad time with this!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not surprisingly the segments range from brilliant to only fair. Most of the fuss seems to be over Godard&#39;s contribution -- whether you think he&#39;s brilliant or pretentious, his segment won&#39;t change your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the pieces have a clear narrative; others are more a montage of connected images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the pieces is more than 10 minutes or so; if you&#39;re not happy with what&#39;s on the screen, wait for the next segment, and think about how much culture you&#39;re soaking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your eyes open for performances by Buck Henry, Beverly D&#39;Angelo, Elizabeth Hurley, Briget Fonda, Tilda Swinton, and John Hurt. (The Buck Henry segment alone is worth the price of admission).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Its very tough to portray a Tagore novel along cinematographic lines.And if you forget an obscure production of 1967 then its the first time that chokher bali has been done on a grand scale. Overall the sets looked fantastic with the right touches for making a successful period drama.Prasenjit,so used to doing crass commercial stuff made a good effort.I saw the Bengali version and found that Aishwariya&#39;s voice was dubbed,which made her dialog delivery a bit poor. While the director did a good job portraying each of the characters with finesse,yet there was very little in the way of meaningful plot,probably a lack of the story itself.However the development of the characters including those with minor roles seem to be the strongest point.Its tough to make some Tagore stories into films,as only the visual parts seem to get realized.

STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time heroin addict Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) gets out of prison to his bumbling jailbird partner Sparrow (Arnold Stang), needy cripple of a wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker) and bit on the side Molly (Kim Novak.) He&#39;s trying to make it big as a drummer in a band, but until his big break comes along he&#39;s stuck doing the only other thing he was any good at other than being a junkie- dealing cards in high stakes games. And try as he might, even prison hasn&#39;t cured him of his addiction to the devil&#39;s drug- causing him to lie to and deceive all those around him and driving him to desperate measures to feed his habit. His yearning to come off it is his only motivation towards a happy ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When people think of Frank Sinatra they generally think of classic high pitched songs like Under My Skin, New York New York and It Had to Be You. But lest anyone forget he was actually a renowned actor too and, if his performance in the acclaimed From Here to Eternity wasn&#39;t enough, he will also be remembered for this cutting edge drama, dealing with what was at the time the ultra taboo subject of drug abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is often listed as one of the first to feature graphic heroin use (probably the reason behind the 15 certificate) in a time when it was a subject that was still very much pushed underground. In his portrayal of the main protagonist, Sinatra is fine, perfectly conveying the despair, desperation and sincerity of a man losing every second chance that is being given to him. His cold turkey scene is much more intense than Ewan McGregor&#39;s in Trainspotting. The first co-star to make an impression is Parker as Machine&#39;s demanding, needy cripple of a wife, using her husband&#39;s guilt and sense of duty to all the effect she can. Novak as his secret lover still manages some strong moments but is less of a star than Parker. Stang does his usual comic relief thing, as the bumbling sidekick who trails the leading man around with his waspy New York accent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Otto Preminger does allow the pace to drag a bit sometimes but this is still a powerfully absorbing film all the way, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns and which should be admired for being one of the first films to bring such a grim subject so powerfully to life. ****

Forget all those sappy romantic movies involving notebooks and lip-locked couples who somehow manage to go to the great beyond together after a screen lifetime of over-simplified unrealistic romance. Forget all those shameless &#34;dog gives its life to save its family&#34; flicks (although I have to admit that I have a soft spot for them myself). Forget Ricky Schroeder already displaying his propensity to overact at a tender age (now that one WAS shameless!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This TV-movie, which unfortunately never seems to get aired anymore, is the all-time champion of tear-jerkers, hands down. And a well-written and well-acted story to boot. Ann-Margret took a big chance in taking this role. Nothing flamboyant or sexy about her here, and that&#39;s a monumental achievement in itself. Based on a true story, she plays Lucile Fray, a terminally ill mother who chooses to struggle till her dying breath to find good homes for her ten children, instead of leaving them in the hands of unpredictable government agencies. Frederic Forrest does a great job as her husband, the good-hearted but unreliable breadwinner whose crippling arthritis and personal demons make him unable to care for the kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film takes us through Lucile&#39;s heart-wrenching process of interviewing prospective parents and then watching her kids leave home. It also gives us the perspective of the children themselves, and of the father - grieving over the tragedy taking place now and the one sure to follow, and frustrated over his inability to do more. The scene in which the youngest of the children (Steven)is taken to his new home is the most heart-breaking I&#39;ve ever watched. Now, I grew up as a &#34;hopeless romantic&#34;, and have spent the many years since then growing myself a harder, more cynical shell. I usually find more to mock than to empathize with in the sentimental cinematic tripe foisted upon us these days. But this gem from the early 1980&#39;s still slays me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish that someone with a lick of marketing sense would release a DVD version of this drama. Among the special features one needs to include the Emmy Awards telecast the following year. A-M was nominated for this role, but the award for best dramatic actress went to Barbara Stanwyck for &#34;Thorn Birds.&#34; In what has to be one of the greatest moments in what is now a truly drab awards show, Stanwyck broke into tears during her acceptance speech and gushed out, &#34;Ann-Margret, I love you!&#34;, which brought Ann-M to tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note. The IMDb rating for &#34;Who Will Love My Children&#34; is 6.4 as of this writing. However, over 75% of the ratings are in the 8-10 range (mostly 10&#39;s). Whatever kind of handicapping system this site uses to modify the overall ratings of the movies listed by IMDb, it completely misses the mark on this one. This one is the &#34;weeper&#34; of all time, and a darn good TV-movie to boot.

Is there a movement more intolerant and more judgmental than the environmentalist movement? To a budding young socialist joining the circus must seem as intimidating as joining a real circus. Even though such people normally outsource their brain to Hollywood for these important issues, the teachings of Hollywood can often seem fragmented and confusing. Fortunately Ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here you&#39;ll learn the art of wagging your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark smirk. You&#39;ll learn how to shrug off logic and science with powerful arguments of fear. You&#39;ll learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by labeling it as the gateway to planetary Armageddon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to learning how to lie with a straight face you&#39;ll also learn how to shrug off accusations that are deflected your way no matter how much of a hypocrite you are. You&#39;ll be able to use as much energy as Al Gore yet while having people treat you as if you were Amish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the second season was even more useful as we were able to visit other Hollywood Gods, holy be thy names, and audit - i.e. judge - their lifestyles. NOTE: This is the only time it&#39;s appropriate for an envirofascist to judge another because it allows the victim the chance to buy up all sorts of expensive and trendy eco-toys so that they can wag their finger in other people&#39;s faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does Ed have in store for us in season three? Maybe he&#39;ll teach us how to be judgmental while sleeping!

Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80&#39;s during the Cannes or other film festival and one said &#34;Hey, guys let&#39;s do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria.&#34; Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling&#39;s Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money&#39;s worth. Not every director succeeded but more did than not and the flick seems to improve with each viewing over the years. My favorite is the eerily beautiful love duet from Die Todt Statd; okay a young naked Elizabeth Hurley is eye candy but her husband singing to her, his wife&#39;s ghost, is incredibly beautiful with the love music second only to Otello and Desdemona&#39;s &#34;Gia nella Notte Densa&#34; in all the operatic repertoire. Could the flick been better, sure, what couldn&#39;t not have been but it&#39;s well worth a view especially of you&#39;re in a hyper-romantic mood.

After mistaking a Halloween re-broadcast of Orson Welles&#39; classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a real Martian invasion, a group of moronic Martians shows up on Earth looking to conquer only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is often quite good and funny, with some decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) to boot. It will most likely appeal to Sci-Fi fans. This has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much better than I expected it to be. Despite a cast made up of no-name stars, this may just be the funniest Martian invasion ever put to film. Interestingly enough, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic Action Hero/Sci-Fi Hero stereotype there is (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist). Fun for the whole family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Prepare to DIE! Earth Scum!&#34;

Team Spirit is maybe made by the best intentions, but it misses the warmth of &#34;All Stars&#34; (1997) by Jean van de Velde. Most scenes are identic, just not that funny and not that well done. The actors repeat the same lines as in &#34;All Stars&#34; but without much feeling.

I found this movie boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried, shallow &#34;upbeat&#34; ending that didn&#39;t ring true to the overall story. Following these characters through a weekend of awful events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news just isn&#39;t my idea of a watchable, interesting movie and I got very tired of its &#34;one note&#34; theme and couldn&#39;t wait for it to end--in fact I almost stopped about halfway through. The whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering, and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant, though the acting was good. A small movie with small ambitions and small appeal--sorry, but it just didn&#39;t make it with me, and I love good, small films! This one just didn&#39;t jell, though I kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their &#34;Year&#39;s 10 Best&#34; list. I&#39;d strongly recommend watching &#34;The House of Sand&#34; instead--now there&#39;s a good, small film!

Pierce Brosnan the newest but no longer James Bond, is an assassin. He is very very good at what he does, but he&#39;s getting old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man. Now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives. Then one night they are having drinks in a bar, and they begin to talk. Then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events. The story is excellent, the acting is top notch, and the humor is hilarious I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would be this funny, but he really is and I must say this movie is a must see.

The glorious Edward gets to move up in the world when his supervisor tells him that he can drop those filthy Swedish drama movies and head up stairs to the splatter and gore department. Excited along with his big anticipations for the new type of movies he soon will be going to edit, he asks all sorts of questions, about the wage, his workspace and lunch brake. Well, not really. Edward is maybe quite the opposite. Calm, stuttering guy, on top of that, he got glasses. With the exception when he&#39;s insane. I guess that created a much creepier atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evil Ed is with all reason a Swedish movie, but somehow a magical force came across the good actors and turned their lovely Swedish accents into stereotypical American voices. I guess that&#39;s some of the expertise an actor needs these days. The acting is very.wooden, as in they are inflexible, not bendable (well hey, what did you actually expect?). On top of that the movie has a jamming techno theme song, sounds like its E-Type. In any case, this only makes the movie experience worse. Since I&#39;m fairly harsh against this movie so far, there will usually be a breaking point where I tone the level of happiness up. But there&#39;s really not much to say. The blueprints look good, but somehow &#39;Hanz&#39; spelt coffee over it and partially destroyed it. That&#39;s how I look at this movie. If the movie ended where Edward is taken to a mental institute and they refurnished the parts from where he goes insane and kills people, the result would have been much better, but that&#39;s just my radical view. I would also like to see more footage from the lose limbs movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also illogical things to discover in this piece of movie. Let&#39;s to say that the actors really are American, living in America, why would they then work on a Swedish movie, like Edward did? And also, that delivery man, why is it that he never uses the doorbell which is located directly beside him? Instead he goes away with tapping softly at the door. Good old Edward really got some good ears to hear all that while he is editing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this movie had its moments, it&#39;s just a shame there were not that many. But that doesn&#39;t mean I would not recommend it. It&#39;s a rather cheap movie, go ahead and buy. It&#39;s almost like I see a pattern for the price and the movie. On the other side; if you like watching dubbed movies getting crappier by the second this might be IT. My verdict would then be a rock solid 4.

The Plainsman is an entertaining western, no doubt a classic, which is actual even today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, ideal for the role, together with John Wayne and James Stewart, they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation. Jean Arthur is great as Calamity Jane, nobody that I know played it better than her. Even if might not be historically accurate, the film manages to capture the most important about Hickok and about the time it takes place. Sometimes you have to sacrifice History to make your point and that is what DeMille does here. The friendship of Hickok with Buffalo Bill, the selling of rifles to the Indians by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have because of the end of the civil war, Custer and Little Big Horn, the uneasy relationship between Buffalo Bill&#39;s wife, a religious woman, with Hickok a man who had killed plenty, also the unusual love affair between Hickok and Calamity all this makes &#39;The Plainsman&#39; a non conventional and interesting film. Anthony Quinn has a very short appearance, that already shows what a great actor he was going to become. A lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time.

This movie is about as underrated as Police Acadmey Mission to Moscow. This movie is never funny. It&#39;s maybe the worst comedy spoof ever made. Very boring,and dumb beyond belief. For those people that think this movie is underrated god help you. I give this movie * out of ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

If you have any clue about Jane Austen´s production, you´ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring, but I like Austen´s characters, because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in Emma. The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she´s very good in her leading role. Also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don´t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious.

What &#34;Noise&#34; fails to do is get us to understand its character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can&#39;t deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer, particularly car alarms. It&#39;s an odd idea for a film, which has about as much creative credibility as &#34;Death Wish.&#34; It is clever at points; particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through Hagel, &#34;I&#39;m too stupid to be understanding this.&#34; He reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion, we read it and don&#39;t get it either.Just then a car alarm goes off. Throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises. Though, all in all it does little to help us understand our hero, who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper-into his persona. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film-making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems, shoddy editing, and visible boom mikes. No, &#34;Noise&#34; isn&#39;t all-bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the ending doesn&#39;t fall flat. Overall it drives home a logistical point, one you haven&#39;t probably thought of. At least I hadn&#39;t. Though all in all, ninety minutes long, it couldn&#39;t have ended sooner. The story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival, but probably won&#39;t get picked up for distribution. Check it out on DVD if you&#39;re really partial to someone involved in the project. Otherwise skip it.

An obvious vanity press for Julie in her first movie with Blake. Let&#39;s see. Where do we begin. She is a traitor during a world war; she redeems that by falling in love; her friends (who are presumably patriots because they are German citizens) are expendable and must die; and she winds up as a heroine. OK. The scenes with the drunken pilot and the buffoons who work for French intelligence can&#39;t even be described, and we won&#39;t even mention Rock&#39;s romantic scenes with a female. (By the way, when they visit a museum, look at his gaze - I reran it on video and it&#39;s priceless). Is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie? I don&#39;t know and you won&#39;t either.

i saw this movie when i was 13 and i really liked dana plato who later starred in different strokes as kimberly drummond . i don&#39;t think it&#39;s garbage .it was not meant to be a sequel to the documentary either . its just a cute kids movie about 3 children who go after men trying to find the boggy creek monster . the men get hurt and the kids rescue them with the help of the creature .haunting shots of the arkansas swamp and scenery were neat . this is a good movie for kids ,no real violence a few mild scares but good fun for the young kids.

Low budget &#34;films&#34; like this just give me hope as an aspiring screenwriter. In other words, if there are people out there who are willing to finance a piece of schlock like this, than there&#39;s certainly much more than a glimmer of hope for someone like myself who can actually write stories. This film is right up there, or should I say &#34;down there&#34; with the Ed Wood&#39;s of the world. The story, if you can call it that, and the dialog, not to mention the sophomoric acting, is a travesty toward the genre itself. Someone should have driven a stake through this stinker while it was still just on paper. It follows that since literature has pretty much been killed off, that film should follow. In order to have a good or even just passable movie, you must have at the very least decent writing. The legendary Curt Siodmak springs to mind. They used a lot of his stories for low budget films way back when but they still come off today as good, serious entertainment, i.e. &#34;Donavan&#39;s Brain&#34;. The cast for this &#34;work&#34; should seriously consider going back to work at their respective hamburger joints or shoe stores and forget about any future feeble attempts at appearing in front of a camera. Avoid this one like the plague itself!!!

What was this about ?? Pre-destination, you can not change the future cause it has already been written ??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll give it this much. I did want to see what happened next and therefore watched the whole movie. This movie took a concept and made it watchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re looking for a recommendation, See it at matinee prices. No thrills but an interesting concept. They should have left the Y2K reference out....

Ugh. Yes, it&#39;s exactly like the McMartin mess, or the horrific arrests in Wenatchee, Washington. In the movie, the mother keeps aggressively questioning her little boy, over and over and over, until he finally tells her what she obviously wants to hear. The court investigators and &#34;therapists&#34; repeat the pattern. The questioning itself is sexually creepy, a relentlessy repeated assault in its own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moviemakers throw in a doctor talking about physical evidence of abuse, maybe to justify the film&#39;s point of view: that two- to four-year-olds never make &#34;things like this&#34; up. Well, they will if every adult they know is asking them to. The way this piece endorses such discredited interrogation techniques makes watching it an exercise in frustration for anyone who knows what it takes to get a successful prosecution in real life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(They also add a special arrest incident towards the end to &#34;prove&#34; their case -- no parallel to this fictional incident ever occurred in real life. Can&#39;t say more here without turning this into a spoiler, but you&#39;ll know it when you see it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, children are abused, sometimes by paid care providers. But to watch a movie which affirms the ludicrous, hysterical accusations against so many totally innocent people, to watch re-creations of the trials that ruined the lives of countless children as well as the lives of the accused -- I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d last until the end. It&#39;s just too sad, and made more so by the writing team&#39;s seeming endorsement of the abusive, paranoid, obsessional questioning techniques that started -- what can we call it? The bonfire of the sanities? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one I know has ever been accused of child abuse, thank heaven, but my 12-times-over-great grandmother was accused of witchcraft and killed for it. Mobs filled with what they think is holy anger are just as dangerous now as three hundred years ago. Sensational drivel like this -- &#34;These accusations of Satanic abuse are cropping up all over the country, there must be something there!&#34; &#34;So tell the jury that!&#34; -- just eggs them on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And whoever thought it was a good idea to have kids under ten, some of them under five, play these roles? It&#39;s traumatic to watch them delivering their lines; how much more traumatic was it to act these parts? The moviemakers&#39; commitment to fight child abuse apparently doesn&#39;t apply to themselves. And what were the child-actors&#39; parents THINKING? &#34;Melinda&#34; (uncredited, at least in the version on the A&amp;E Network in 2005, but I think it was Cassy Friel) and &#34;Teddy&#34; (Brian Bonsall) were terrific. Professionals or not, though, they were too young to be exposed to this material, much less to be paid to act it out. Despite ruthlessly exploiting these real-life children, &#34;Do You Know The Muffin Man&#34; got an Emmy nomination for directing -- which just goes to show how crazed things were, back in 1989.

Eichard Gere &amp; Diane Lane back again in another romantic love story. They are an excellent team,BUT somehow this film will not be among there best, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director George Wolfe using a screenplay by Ann Peacock &amp; John Romanao, for Nicholas Sparks novel, does a capable job. This is yet another tale of 2 strangers meeting &amp; falling in love,then they go on there way,then when they are about to meet again &amp; start a life together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILER but not really. Tragedy happens, one of them dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many times have we seen this already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who never saw tearjerkers like this will hopefully like it more than I did. This story has about every cliché there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this has the ratings I will give it. is because of the fine acting &amp; excellent production . The cast besides our 2 stars, includes Christopher Meloni, Viola Davis &amp; Scott Glenn. they all give real good performances &amp; do the very best with the material they were given&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a good but not over done storm sequence, The sex scenes are well done, no nudity &amp; next to no foul language,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ratings: *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 out of 10)

This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it&#39;s one hell of a good time. This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devil&#39;s Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky&#39;s shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they&#39;re the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable&#39;s scenes. It&#39;s as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day. But Chucky and Tiffany were great to watch and I really liked the black humor to it. I thought it made the movie stand out more. If you want one hell of a good time then be sure to check this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10.

Gung Ho was a good idea, however it is to much to ask Americans viewers to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition.In this movie the main character Hunt Stevenson(Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and convinces a Japanese auto company to come to America and help his dying Pennslyvania town. Two things come at you.First why would a Japanese company come to America to make cars when they do so ,and so well at that? Secondly can anyone understand that American companies of all types go to third world nations to have their products made to escape American labor costs? It makes the film&#39;s premise then that the Number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its&#39; top competitors(aside from Germany)and put a plant there as unrealistic. Keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time. But he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but Director Ron Howard can&#39;t keep this from becoming a TV movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of Japanese and American relations not withstanding. Gung Ho has a Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley feel to it as the producers of both TV shows made the film and then made the TV version of this movie as well which gives the film its&#39; lightweight feel.The Japanese manager gets to love his American workers and feels he and other Japanese people can learnfrom Americans.His No.2 man Saito who supposedly doesn&#39;t like Americans all that much doesn&#39;t think so.I would have prefered all the Japanese characters been like Saito than the soft goofball characters they made the Japanese out to be.It would have made the film more interesting.

Finally got to see this movie last weekend. What a disappointment..it barely reaches &#34;made for TV&#34; level. Given the list of actors, I would have expected something substantially more sophisticated. The movie lacks a good story, well, actually any story for that matter. It has no credibility, instead lots of predictability. Save yourself the money and the time.

I haven&#39;t seen this film since it came out in the mid 70s, but I do recall it as being a very realistic portrayal of the music business ( right up there with Paul Simons &#34;One Trick Pony &#34; ..another vastly underrated film IMO )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harvey Keitel does an excellent job as a producer caught between the music he believes in , and the commercial &#34;tripe&#34; the record company &#34;suits&#34; want him to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I spent my entire career in the music business as a composer /arranger /producer, I can really vouch for the verisimilitude this film possesses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it should ever come out on DVD uncut, I&#39;d buy it!

Had this movie been made a few years later, I would have given it a lower score. However, for 1909, this was a dandy little movie and still stands up pretty well today. Just don&#39;t try to compare this silent film to later silents--the industry changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century don&#39;t look at all like movies made in the 1910s and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is 11 minutes long (about average for most films back then) and is a variation of the Edgar Allen Poe story, THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO. While many are familiar with the story, I won&#39;t elaborate further as I don&#39;t want to ruin the film. Just suffice to say that it&#39;s very creepy!!

I just don&#39;t understand why this movie is getting beat-up in here. Jeez. It is mindless, it isn&#39;t polished and it is (as I am reading) wasted on some. The cast of this movie plays their characters to the &#39;T&#39; (If you watched Permanent Midnight and became a Ben Stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed). These are misunderstood, well-intentioned misfits trying to save the city/world with nothing but grit and determination. The problem is they don&#39;t realize their limits until the big showdown and that&#39;s the point! This is 3 times the movie that The Spy Who Shagged Me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group, likely the same people who feel the first AP movie pales in comparison to the sequel. I just don&#39;t get it. The jokes work on more then one level; if you didn&#39;t get it I know what level you&#39;re at.

Fever Pitch is a fun enough movie. It has a lot of funny moments (including a hilariously disturbing shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, it has a &#34;dead zone&#34; in the middle where all the heavy, &#34;she&#39;s breaking up with me&#34; stuff happens, but other than that it continues to be funny until the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the Red Sox, it&#39;s not overloaded with sports. You don&#39;t have to be a fan to enjoy this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course that&#39;s easy for me to say: I&#39;ve been a Red Sox fan since I was a boy, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barky

I didn&#39;t really like this movie that much at all. It wasn&#39;t really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this, it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in. I mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but that&#39;s about it. The only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and I&#39;m not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found. All in all it was a couple notches below an average movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Query:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theaters: So glad I didn&#39;t squander too much money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DVD Purchase: Ummm, let me think....no!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rental: If you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not.

Why didn&#39;t this pick up a bag full of Oscars? It is an amazing interpretaion of an oft-filmed/performed piece. The visuals are breathtaking (especially in wide-screen...the pan &amp; scan really kills this film&#39;s wonderful cinematography and sets). Every frame is a painting. Astounding. The play is almost completely intact, and Branagh&#39;s passion for it is clear from the opening titles on. No Zefferelli here, just great storytelling the way only film can, but rarely does. Jacobi is especially perfect as Hamlet&#39;s murderous Uncle: he doesn&#39;t play him as a mustache- curling evil villian, but a charming politician, allowing us to see why only Hamlet suspects foul play. Branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between Hamlet&#39;s fake/real madness and the burning revenge inside him. And the many cameos come off quite well, everyone from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardeu and Charlton Heston, unobtrusive if you are sucked into Branagh&#39;s vision the way I was. A mesmerizing piece.

This movie ... I saw it 15 years ago and in the last years couldn&#39;t remember it any more, name or anything else, just it was about a Romanian country man played superbly by Anthony Quinn. The impression I got from this drama will be eternal. Finally I found the name of the movie, I hope I will be able to buy it. And honestly this movie worth 10 Oscars. Ten times BRAVO. I was quite young when I first saw the movie. I asked my friends if they heard about this story but nobody would know anything about Anthony Quinn playing the role of a Romanian peasant. I remember when a German officer came and saw Anthony and told him he was a good &#34;breed&#34; but in fact the German was cheating on him. For few bucks you won&#39;t get rich in case you buy the movie but you will be rich if you have it.

I&#39;m always surprised about how many times you&#39;ll see something about World War 2 on the German national television. You would think they don&#39;t like to open old wounds, but there isn&#39;t a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war. Perhaps it&#39;s a way of dealing with their past, I don&#39;t know, but you sure can&#39;t blame them of ignoring what happened. And it has to be said: most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies (think for instance about &#34;Der Untergang&#34; or &#34;The Downfall&#34; as you might now it) which are also very realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of those movies is &#34;Rosenstrasse&#34;. It tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war, even though the movie starts with a family in the USA, at the present day. After Hannah&#39;s father died, her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox Jew even though she hasn&#39;t been very religious before. She doesn&#39;t know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from, but as she starts digging in her mother&#39;s troubled childhood, Hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mother&#39;s past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the Nazi regime is already quite surprising. For as far as I know, there hasn&#39;t been another movie that deals with this subject. (For those who didn&#39;t know this yet: Being married to a so-called pure Aryian man or woman meant for many Jews that they weren&#39;t immediately sent to one of the concentration camps, but that they had to work in a factory). But it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages, it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives. How difficult it sometimes was for them during the Nazi regime and how these people, most of the time women, did everything within their power to free their men, once they were captured and locked away in for instance the Rosenstrasse...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is really good and the story is very well written, although the way it was presented in the beginning didn&#39;t really do it for me (and that&#39;s exactly the only part that you&#39;ll get to see in the trailer). Perhaps it&#39;s just me, but I would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day. At least of the part that is situated in the USA, because the part where Hannah goes to Berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mother&#39;s past, definitely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in everything that has something to do with the Second World War, and if you aren&#39;t necessarily looking for a lot of action shots, than this is definitely a movie you should see. This isn&#39;t a movie in which you&#39;ll see any battles or gunfights, but it certainly is an interesting movie, because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of. I give it an 8/10.

Pretentious storytelling such as this always uses the same technique: 1) Throw opaque, unstructured threads around to perplex the audience. 2) Deal only in `big&#39; topics such as life, death and God. 3) Make it appear profound with scenes of life, death, sky, etc. 4) Depend on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt. 5) And finally, laugh all the way to critical acclaim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is pretentious faux-intellectualism at its boldest. Not only do these filmmakers not answer any questions, they&#39;re afraid to pose the questions to begin with. The film is held together by wisps. Directions are raised and dropped awkwardly. Pop cultural references are jolting and arbitrary. There is so little to point at, that any critical stabs will miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critics who found an intellectual base to this movie are afraid to admit the truth: they have no idea what this movie is about. Good news: neither do the filmmakers. Satisfying attempts at answers to profound questions about human existence demand wit, intellect, poetry, and genius. Sadly, this movie demonstrates none of these traits.

I pride myself in being able to sit through everything. I think &#34;if I&#39;ve paid the rental fee, then I&#39;m going to at least watch it&#34;. I have found the exception to this rule- The Planet. I don&#39;t know what the exchange rate is, but reading through the other comments I can only guess that £8000 must be around $150. I&#39;ll date myself but this movie reminds me of the old Steve Reeves movies of the 50&#39;s. He was a bodybuilder turned actor. He was in these really awful Italian, dubbed movies that starred Reeves as Hercules or some other muscle bound hero. As a kid watching them you couldn&#39;t quite articulate why these movies stunk- you just knew they did. Mike Mitchell IS the new Steve Reeves. That&#39;s it.. that&#39;s what this really was- a new telling of an old Italian &#34;Spaghetti Sand and Sandals&#34; movie. And, I kid you not- where was Reeves born? Glasgow, Montana. This movie isn&#39;t so bad that it&#39;s kind of fun to watch- it&#39;s just plain bad.

This is another Sci-Fi channel original movie staring Rhys Davies where its hard to decide whats worse, the acting, or the writing/directing/producing (John Sheppherd helms all three.)Basic story: obsessed exobiologist captures chubacabra monster,smuggles it in a cargo container aboard a cruise ship it escapes and the blood bath begins. Clichéd sci fi cast of the sturdy captain with the beautiful daughter, handsome hero and mad scientist. Captian calls in a terrorist alert for the ship (since of course wouldn&#39;t believe a monster story.)No dramatic Helicopter drop of the Navy Seals here. Budget only allowed for entire force force of eight seals to arrive in a fiberglass fishing boat and ride a ships wench aboard. Puleeze. Also cheesy computer animation of the ship you could do better on your computer. I also loved when the Seal commander looking thru standard binoculars from ten miles away was able to see three people jump of the ship. If the Sci-Fi channel is going to continue original movies I hope they realize there audience is not kindergarten level and purchase better scripts and directors. If this were direct to video you would find it in the 99 cent bin.

The movie is a riot - hilariously funny yet graphically violent. Just when you think you can&#39;t take any more it gives you more. Great thiller. The cast is excellent and the plot is very convincing. The past does indeed catch up with our hero, but right(?) prevails.

Only in the Hollywood audiovisual fiction world could anybody, including FBI agents, be so unbelievably stupid. The good guys are stupid enough to pick up everything they&#39;re interested in, answer phones, go up stairways, all in search for a demolition expert who&#39;s out to get everybody. Oh yes, and then we get the Hollywood SUPERVILLAIN. He can be shot, even if he&#39;s got a vest on, and then fall down a long flight of steps and then still have the upper hand over his stupid pursuers. Every cliché you can think of in suspense movies were used. I only watched it because Yuki Amami is so HOT. Oh,,,,but yes, it&#39;s great to see how morally superior this FBI agent is, when she&#39;s pretty certain that there&#39;s a bomb in an Opera House, and she doesn&#39;t sound the alarm. Who writes these scripts????????????

These are the kinds of movies I loved, and still love growing up. Unlike big budget movies that crate huge plot holes and never acknowledge them. This movie takes in all in stride and just makes something you can sit back and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was some film student earlier that complained it wasn&#39;t A list material. But that is not the point. The point of this movie is that no everyone likes huge CGI Cliché&#39; filled movies. There are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to just entertain you, and not get as much money as they can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, its also nice to know that good ol&#39; Bruce isn&#39;t dead yet.

you will likely be sorely disappointed by this sequel that&#39;s not a sequel.AWIL is a classic.but this movie is about as far from being a classic as you can get.what a joke.special effects that aren&#39;t very special,horrible dialogue,non acting.and a laughably ridiculous subplot quickly and unconvincingly,(not to mention fleeting)tacked on with about a third of the movie left.did i mention the story is less then lame.there&#39;s no way this was supposed to be serious horror movie,yet it&#39;s to stupid to be funny in any good way.the rating it currently has(4.8/10)is too generous if you ask me.my rating for An American Werewolf in Paris:a 3.5/10

I hadn&#39;t planned on watching O12 because I didn&#39;t like O11 that much. I thought O11 was a nice but slightly boring little bank robbers movie with a sensational arsenal of stars. Anyway I was talked into watching O12 one night and I regretted it a lot. The plot is not only boring but also senseless. I honestly don&#39;t even know what it was all about. I left the movie after 3 quarters and got some coffee with another girl who didn&#39;t like it. Much more pleasure I can tell you that. But even the guys who stayed till the end later reported to me that the plot continued being awful and useless. My advice: Don&#39;t watch. Go watch Team America (hilarious btw;-)) and forget about Ocean&#39;s Twelve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion the most boring and senseless peace of crap to be on the screen in years.

This movie is a vehicle for Schwarzenegger-clone Alexander Nevsky. His charisma however is insufficient to lift this movie above the level of its poor script. He has little to add to his Arnie-act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael York is quite pathetic as the begging diplomat. Watching him revisit his D&#39;Artagnan-act from the time that he was a better actor made me feel uneasy. Come on, you can do better than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is full of holes and unexplained relations; top of this bill is the informer of Vlad, who sounds like an American woman, but from the context appears to be working for a Russian government-department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the story takes place well after the end of the Communist-regime, all the Russian characters are still very communist-like. In contradiction to that, Vlad is allowed to drive a pimped up all utility vehicle as police-car. The action scenes are poorly shot and therefore lack dynamics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a must see movie...

Vulpine Massacre should have been this movies actual title. And the tag-line should have read &#34;Guaranteed to make your kids CRY!&#34; This is a nature drama telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region. Starting with the meeting and pairing of two young foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and the trials of raising them. The only speaking is done in narrative by a tree that stands over the den, giving insight into the animals loves and lives... Lovely scenery and gorgeous filming of the animals. Sounds good huh? Well from there things go straight to hell and then start drilling towards the core...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Spoilers Below - Or they it may be a Warning!***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost first off we learn one of the foxes is born blind. But seems to get along well enough and there&#39;s a beautifully cheerful musical score to accompany him... And then he dies... Next we have one of the siblings adventures. And then he dies... One of the sisters gets her screen-time... and then she dies...And so it goes like some horrific slasher movie as one fox after another is killed off by nature, in traps, just up and vanish, and even by a bunch of snowmobiles! By the end of the movie almost all the foxes have been massacred. Though mercifully no deaths are shown on screen. (Least not in the version we saw.) Unlike say &#34;Tarka the Otter&#34; the deaths in this movie are almost all pointless and border on the sadistic in the way hopes are built up and then snuffed out. One or two losses would have been acceptable. It is a nature film after all. But not nearly the whole family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not go to see this film deceived by the cheery box into thinking its safe for the kids. Watch it with some foreknowledge that things are *not* going to go well at all and that you or your kids may be left feeling very badly depending on how sensitive you or they are. You may enjoy it. Or you may not...

*May Contain Spoilers* A few weeks after I had originally wrote my review for Hood of the Living Dead I realized that I may have been a bit too harsh on this movie. Which is why I decided I would do something I had never done before. Review the same movie again. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still don&#39;t like the movie, I still think it&#39;s dreck, and I still think the zombies don&#39;t look all that zombie-ish. The story in the movie is still in my opinion, weak and rather lame. The story is about a guy named Rick, who works as a scientist (that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells, in animals) and his brother Germaine, the two aren&#39;t exactly on the best of terms (my my, an original plot point) and argue a lot. One day Germaine is shot in a drive-by shooting, and Rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate Germaine(whereas most people would&#39;ve called 911, but whatever), naturally the serum fails and Germaine &#34;dies&#34; (if that didn&#39;t happen there&#39;d have been no movie), after the police and the coroner (until the end of time I will still think that maybe the paramedics should&#39;ve shown up) leave the scene shows the coroner van (which I still believe was just someone&#39;s van with a &#34;coroner&#34; decal thrown on the side), and Germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics. I would talk more about the plot, but I feel that if I reveal more about the story you wouldn&#39;t want to watch it (and we wouldn&#39;t want that now would we?), but suffice to say that the story (in my opinion at least) meanders and is rather slow moving (pun not intended). As I&#39;ve previously said in my review the zombies don&#39;t look all that much like zombies, I still think they look like they&#39;ve been in a bar fight. That&#39;s not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot, but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims. Also I still don&#39;t like the fact that the director(s) continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move. They couldn&#39;t really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble (as most zombie movies do), don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m all for running zombies but make up your minds people. In one scene the zombie runs toward the living, and in the other he just shambles to them. And sometimes they just don&#39;t seem believable (yes I know their fictitious creatures but still), I am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room, and I still don&#39;t like the zombie who is lying on the ground, gets shot, then jerks like he was just shot. The sound in the movie also bothered me, mainly the music, which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much non-existent. Music in a movie is important folks. Especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick. The acting is still atrocious (in my opinion) and is on par with the American &#34;actors&#34; from the Japanese zombie movie Junk. The movie is still bad, almost House of the Dead bad, it&#39;s better, no doubt about that, but then again that&#39;s not saying much. It&#39;s not the worst movie out there, and it is better than a lot of direct to video movies that are out there but at the end of the day wasn&#39;t good. I also think the movie moves really really slow, despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes (and yes, I still don&#39;t like the opening song). This is the type of movie I think is well-suited to be premiered on the Sci-Fi network. Which is why I am obligated to give this debacle of a film a one out of ten. But think of it this way, at least it&#39;s not a negative one.

As I&#39;ve noticed with a lot of IMDb comments, certain reviewers seem to demand that every film they see have smugly intelligent plots that wallow in there own cleverness. I am not one of those people. If I watch an action film, I want to see explosions, gunfire and heroics. If I watch a comedy, I want to have tears of laughter in my eyes. You get the idea. Therefore watching a horror film, I primarily want to be scared. The Grudge is a very scary film, in both it&#39;s well executed &#39;jump&#39; scenes, and it&#39;s creepy imagery. I&#39;ve been a horror film fan for many years, and I&#39;m talking about the masters such as Dario Argento, rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days. If you want to be scared, watch this film. Way scarier than the original Japanese &#39;Ring&#39; (which I also think is a great film).

Luckily for Bill Murray this is such a light-weight project since he pretty much has to carry it. Meatballs is the story of low-rent Camp Northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another. Then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named Camp Mohawk which culminates in a two-day Olympiad competition. Above it all is Bill Murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is sprinkled with medium-sized laughs, chuckles, and more than a few guffaws along the way. The biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director. Three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he&#39;s sleeping. Morty, or &#34;Micky&#34; as everyone calls him, wakes up along the side of a road, strung up in some trees several feet above the ground, and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another, but this is a PG rated film with little in the way of raunchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace. Of course it&#39;s up to Murray to teach the kid how to open up, and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the Olympiad. The sentimentality of Rudy&#39;s situation seems tacked on to a great degree. Notice how when Murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him, &#34;you must be the short depressed kid we ordered.&#34; Makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or Murray was just ad-libbing while the cameras were rolling. In other words, Murray might as well have said to Makepeace, &#34;you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn&#39;t fit in.&#34; But before it&#39;s all over, Murray&#39;s performance makes this plot device more than bearable. He really seems to have some good chemistry with Makepeace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film culminates with the games between the two rival camps. Very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable, but &#34;it just doesn&#39;t matter&#34;. This is a pretty good film on many levels. Don&#39;t let the absurd 5.6 rating this film is currently getting scare you off. Murray will keep you laughing throughout. Just be warned..... avoid the sequels!!!! Especially the one with Corey Feldman!! 8 of 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hound.

Although I rated this movie a 2 for showing a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale. I couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but I didn&#39;t care because I knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter. Dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but I believe this is because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile. It doesn&#39;t matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment. I particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks. I believe the doctor refers to this as treatment. Genius!

The first twenty-five minutes stand out as possibly the worst in modern British film. Director/adapter William Cartlidge has treated Wilde&#39;s original with such reverence that he seems to have completely ignored the needs of a cinematic audience. Thankfully the quality of the direction and editing improves significantly after the first half hour, but by then the damage has been done. Of the actors, Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy wipe the floor with the rest of the cast every time they are on screen. The other exceptions are Jonathan Firth&#39;s Arthur and Karen Hayley&#39;s Mabel, who are given enough latitude to deliver their lines with the true comic sense which Wilde intended. The ostensible leads, James Wilby and Trevyn McDowell, are in comparison lacklustre and wooden. In an obvious attempt to eke every penny out a meagre budget, the play has been nominally updated to the 1990&#39;s, but in conjunction with the original script the effect is more of a badly script 1970s TV drama. True moments of comedy are few and far between, but when they arrive are highly amusing - a sign, maybe, that more judicious pruning of the rest of the play might have led to a better paced, more even film.

This movie is worse than &#34;heaven&#39;s gate&#34; or &#34;plan 9 from outer space&#34;. Don&#39;t know why it got even one Oscar, it should have gotten a million raspberries, just like the audiences that either walked out or didn&#39;t show up in the first place. The Hospital was a first-rate financial failure, but I&#39;m certain the elite classes of left-wing, gutter-mouthed intellectuals railed that the American public was far- too plebeian to appreciate biting social-commentary when they saw it, and on and on. George C Scott, in one of most-artless and embarrassing roles, along with aging sex-symbol Diana Rigg spend most of the movie trying to cuss in an increasingly-blasé manner as they push along a silly plot. Poor old George is impotent and is just crushed by the event, but after lots of dirty language between him and Rigg, he rapes her multiple times on lovely night in a filthy, crumbling NYC hospital that looks so disgusting that I wouldn&#39;t want a dying pet rat treated in it. There&#39;s also some sacrilegious junk-dialog tossed about hither and yon, laced with plenty of cussing as well. It ends by portraying the faulty notion that unusual stress without physical exertion always brings on cardiac arrest. Never want to see another minute of this awful movie again.

It&#39;s reassuring to see that other IMDb reviewers have had the good sense to pan this disappointing film, at the risk of blaspheming against the great Vadim, Malle and Fellini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These directors may be talented &amp; artistic in their own right; however in attempting to pass off this hodgepodge of attempted eroticism and 60s chic as *in any way* related to Edgar Allen Poe&#39;s stories, they exposed themselves as frauds. Either (A) they didn&#39;t bother to read the Poe stories, or (B) they read them but were so transfixed by their own egotistical agenda that they didn&#39;t pay Poe any mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine if Metallica plugged in their guitars, cranked the amps up to 11 and moshed out 3 chords claiming it to be Beethoven&#39;s 9th Symphony. That&#39;s the feeling you&#39;ll get after sitting through this film. If you&#39;re a Vadim/Malle/Fellini fan (Metallica), you&#39;ll dig it. If you&#39;re a Beethoven fan (Poe), you&#39;ll puke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;METZERGENSTEIN...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we begin with a bizarre porno version of Poe. OK, &#34;porno&#34; may be a bit extreme haha, but at the very least you have to call it a Barbarella version (including, I don&#39;t doubt, some of Jane&#39;s outfits coming directly from the set of that scifi romp). Vadim falls into old clichés of his own: the girl lying on a bed being pleasured by some man whilst from the pillow-cam we see the apathy in her eyes; the general lassitude and ennui of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism. Cute stuff, but &#34;Metzergenstein&#34; ain&#39;t the place for it. And in addition to the Barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic themes, Jane Fonda&#39;s awful American accent and unconvincing performance as a European countess made this the worst casting since Julia Roberts in that lousy version of Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WILLIAM Wilson...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s a great Poe story about the madness that claims a man when he realizes that he is no longer unique in the world. If you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme, go watch Star Trek episode #27 &#34;The Alternative Factor&#34;. But here, Malle glazes over that central theme and instead focuses on... any guesses...? yup, eroticism, sadism and debauchery. Ho hum. Brigitte Bardot&#39;s role is a complete fabrication to accomplish that end, and once again the director distorts a classic Poe story into a masturbatory catharsis of his own unrequited sexual issues. Do it on your own time, Malle. I thought we&#39;re here on Poe&#39;s dime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOBY DAMMIT....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolute worst of the three and possibly the worst film I&#39;ve seen since &#34;Staying Alive&#34;. At least Fellini showed some tact in changing the title, but his departure from the original plot, theme and humour of the story is so vast, I wonder if he just picked this reel out of his private collection of home movies, stamped &#34;Edgar Allen Poe story&#34; on it and submitted it to this collection. I strained very hard to find any thread of familiarity with Poe&#39;s works, but there was absolutely none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original Poe story (&#34;Never Bet the Devil Your Head&#34;) is a short and hilarious dark fable about a man who constantly exclaims &#34;I&#39;ll bet the devil my head...&#34; On a foggy morning, the devil takes him up on his offer. The result is the sickest and silliest thing you&#39;ve ever read. This was Poe, the comedian, at his finest (yes, Poe wrote many comedies. Also check out &#34;A Predicament&#34; and &#34;Devil in the Belfry&#34; if you want a taste of his witty, satirical works).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Fellini version? It&#39;s bland, soulless, and not funny at all (unless you consider it funny to see a drunk stumbling over himself for 45 minutes). Here Fellini&#39;s egotistical rant is about an artist struggling with the hypocrisy, pretense and mediocrity of cinema. Most of it is set at an awards ceremony where Fellini beats us over the head with sarcasm, cynicism and that classic &#34;sour grapes&#34; attitude that we find in all Fellini films dealing with cinema. Note the sarcastic jabs at &#34;the critics&#34;, a recurring theme in Fellini&#39;s films. For someone who considered himself above the critics, Fellini sure spent a lot of time talking about them. At any rate, I feel like Fellini just took some outtakes from 8 1/2, spliced them together and sold it as a Poe story. Worst &#34;adaptation&#34; ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I put more effort into typing this review than any of the three directors put into making a Poe movie.

Poor Tobe Hopper. He directed an all time horror classic &#34;Texas Chaimsaw Massacre&#34;. Since then everything he&#39;s done has been horrible. This is probably the worst...and that&#39;s saying a lot. It&#39;s about a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to make things (and people) catch fire...or something like that. Hardly an original idea (anyone remember &#34;Firestarter&#34;?) It&#39;s a real mess...literally EVERYTHING is done wrong! Pathetic acting (even Dourif!), asinine script, loust production values, crappy special effects...everything is BAD!!!!! A must miss...not even good for laughs.

This is more than just an adaptation of Bond: it&#39;s a plain rip off! With mediocre character sketches that Ian Fleming would not have approved of, this film goes down as the worst 007 movie. An older (even haggard) Connery tries to relive his past 12 years later. The result is a humourless, tacky version of the classic hero. Give me Roger Moore any day!

Steve Carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy, first on &#39;The Daily Show&#39;, and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin, Carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle aged man living a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a little odd, but in an awkward nice guy sort of way. One night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation. But it&#39;s clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that Andy is, and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity. And so begins Andy&#39;s quest into adulthood. Andy is the quintessential innocent, and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film. Some of the humor is crude gross out stuff, but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy. In addition, I found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. I&#39;m not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama; it&#39;s a rolling in your seats comedy. Still, every good comedy I have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters. A good comparison would be &#39;The Wedding Crashers&#39; from earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes. I particularly loved the ending of the film, which I thought was a perfect way to end the flick. Without giving anything away, it reminded me of &#39;Something About Mary&#39;. Very light and fun; it leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend.

This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. It is an extreme tragedy. It left me sick to my stomach. I hated it. I think if they want to make a movie like this than they should be man enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I would not have seen this movie if I would have known. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie. I am tired of it. I really wanted to have a fun comedy and I am extremely disappointed. It has been several days now and I still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie. I have never been more disappointed in a movie, nor have I ever written a comment on a bad movie. I really think that true deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie, no one would have seen it.

where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. And make no mistake, &#39;mainly ETC.&#39;, the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I&#39;m sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you&#39;ll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer. Questions are raised  everything from the mundane to the profound  but jansen skillfully forces his audience to examine and answer these questions ourselves, with little to no help from the characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;side 1 opens with an increasingly complex and beautifully orchestrated arrangement of non-linear segments to introduce us to the main characters. We meet them on the morning of april 8, 1994  the day kurt cobain committed suicide. And it is the death of cobain, and the journey to his wake two days later in seattle, that serve as the backdrop for the film. In exploring cobain&#39;s life, music, and death, the characters attempt - with varying degrees of success - to understand and come to terms with their own lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are some aspects of the film that are what you might expect from a low-budget indie film: the performances range from decidedly mediocre to outstanding, with the strongest performances coming from jessica scott (holly) and noel wood (daniel); some of the dialogue is admittedly a bit stiff, but never completely strays into the unreal; and there are some minor sound problems, particularly once we get on the road, that make it difficult at times to follow the action on screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but despite its shortcomings, &#39;mainly ETC.&#39; is a solid, deeply affecting piece of cinema. amid moments of haunting poignancy, laugh-out-loud humor, and intimate turmoil, jansen deftly weaves all of the character threads together and illuminates their own struggles while at the same time making them accessible and engaging for us. and because we can see reflections of ourselves in one or more of these characters, we can identify with the questions and issues they&#39;re struggling with, and we&#39;re able to look back and remember where we were on that day in 1994 when for many people the world changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;while jansen takes credit for the writing, editing, and direction of the film, kudos must be given to his photography as well. With an uncanny eye and amazing ability to capture and draw us into each of the characters&#39; worlds, jansen managed to produce shot after shot after shot that stuck with me long after the credits rolled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no review of this film would be complete without a nod to the amazing soundtrack. the music in this film is used to amazing effect; at times subtly underscoring the action, at other times taking center stage, but never getting in the way or deteriorating into kitschy music video. the soundtrack plays like the ultimate greatest hits, though i suspect that label would probably not sit very well with the director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the new double DVD archive edition offers some deleted scenes, trailers, music videos, and a cobain documentary. the deleted scenes offer some insight into the making of the film through alternate opening and closing sequences, and it&#39;s certainly a treat to have the rare and beautiful Raining Kind video. the cobain documentary is fine, if a bit worse for wear, and certainly more extensive documentaries are available for the hardcore fans. conspicuously absent is a director commentary, and i can&#39;t help but wonder if jansen has plans to re-release this at some point with that tasty tidbit attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;suffice to say that the next time you&#39;re looking for a strong piece of work from a talented filmmaker, I recommend you get on board.

North And South (1985): Patrick Swayze, James Read, Lesley Anne Down, Wendy Kilbourne, Terri Garber, Kirstie Alley, Genie Francis, Phillip Casnoff, Jean Simmons, John Stockwell, Lewis Smith, David Carradine, Inga Swenson, Jonathan Frakes, Wendy Fulton, Erica Gimpel, Tony Frank, Jim Metzler, Olivia Cole, Andy Stahl, William Ostrander, George Stanford Brown, Robert Mitchum, Morgain Fairchild, Johnny Cash, Hal Holbrook, Gene Kelly, David Ogden Stiers, John Anderson, Lee Bergere, Olivia De Havilland, Elizabeth Taylor, Forest Whitaker, Robert Jones, ....Director Richard T. Heffron, Teleplay...Paul F. Edwards, Patricia Green, Douglas Heyes, Kathleen A. Shelley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on John Jake&#39;s successful paperback novels &#34;North and South&#34;, &#34;Love and War&#34; and &#34;Heaven and Hell&#34;, this was a mini series on television from 1985 to 1987. Its success owed more to the success of &#34;Roots&#34; a similar Civil War era/slavery soap opera televised about a decade earlier in the 70&#39;s. Patrick Swayze, at the beginning of his career and at the time he was doing many films like Dirty Dancing which would make him famous, stars as Orry Main, a plantation-born young man from South Carolina who sets off to West Point. Here he meets George Hazard (James Read) who is supposed to be the hated enemy, the Yankee North, but with whom he bonds closely. Soon, the Mains from the South and the Hazards from the North become friends despite the turbulent era leading to civil war. The theme of family, friendship and doing the right thing even when the nation was falling apart is at the heart of this otherwise soap opera full of action and romance. Clariss and Ashton (Jean Simmons and Teri Garber) portray sisters who become enemies when one of them marries Yankee Billy Hazard (John Stockwell. Garber&#39;s bitchy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil Ashton is fun to watch on screen. Though the series didn&#39;t cover everything in Jakes&#39; novels, what we see is a condensed version of it and they changed a few things to make it a sort of historical romance with history lessons attached. The characters find themselves in all the major Civil War scenes - Harper&#39;s Ferry where abolitionist and feminist Virgilia Hazard (Kirstie Alley) loses the love of her life, the ex-slave Grady, Fort Sumter, Vicksburg, Antietam, Gettysburg, Appomatox and we are privy to the White House where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Halbrook) battle out the war in his conscience, we meet all the prominent players including Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jackson and Davis. Several veteran Hollywood actors from the Golden Era - Robert Mitchum, Elizabeth Taylor and Olivia De Havilland have cameos and it&#39;s interesting to see them. This is not historical fact, it&#39;s historical FICTION and purely dramatized entertainment. But it&#39;s got cliffhanger endings and beautiful cinematography, costumes and locations. It is like watching an epic movie that runs longer than Gone With The Wind with with war scenes in it! The script may be bad at times and the acting may not be the best, despite the good casting. Swayze hams it up as does Terri Garber but some performances, like that of Kirstie Alley, James Read (as George Hazard)and Leslie Anne Downes as the beautiful and strong Madeline are really good performances. They shot in sets and in Southern locations.The music is enchanting and this is a feel good film in which we root for the good guys and watch the villains scheme and ultimately get their comeuppance. All fans of Civil War movies and the Jakes novels should watch this. It&#39;s available on DVD and VHS.

The tragedy of the doomed ship Titanic has inspired many books and movies. The battle between nature and technology always caught man&#39;s imagination. The latest film concerning this tragedy in the Atlantic Ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker James Cameron. The story of &#34;Titanic&#34; involves two fictional characters (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) from different backgrounds (one is a hobo-artist, the other is an aristocrat) and how their love triumphs over societal barriers and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, although using a historical name, this movie had little regard to history. The plot was built around two fictional lovers, French diamond, and treasure hunters. The deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background. Many historical facts were simply forgotten. Where was the radio operator that ignored the iceberg warnings? Why was there no mention of the ship that was only 5 miles away from the Titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress signal? Omitting these facts is an insult to the tragedy. And what was the point of flavoring this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall plot was rather shallow; rich equals greed and corruption, poverty equals compassion and heroism. It is very ironic to spend $200 million to make a movie about how money corrupts. There was absolutely no human side shown in anti-heroes. It seemed like Billy Zane was playing a part of the devil. Casting was also very poor. If DiCaprio was 2 inches shorter than Winslet, you could swear she was his baby-sitter. The length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over 3 hours. First hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse. Hearing corny pick up lines such as &#34;I see you&#34; and &#34;This is my side of the ship&#34; generated more pain than the screams of drowning people. Also, jokes were too abundant and rather lame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Titanic&#34; did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original. The best thing about this film were its special effects, and that is the only thing that truly deserved an award.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this film lacked artistical value in overall sense, the public could not resist a sentimental story starring Romeo (DiCaprio), and so the movie became a success. Now it is safe to say that the industry will be less hesitant to invest large amounts of money in a single motion picture, so it seems that &#34;Titanic&#34; did achieve something after all.

Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Barbet Schroeder. If you like Hitchcock&#39;s `Rope&#39;, then you will like this movie. `Murder by Numbers&#39; stars Sandra Bullock as psychologically troubled yet brilliant police detective Cassie Mayweather. Her partner is Sam Kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective played by Ben Chaplin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teenage killers are high school students Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). These young psychotics are out to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it, but the nearness of capture is exciting and thrilling to at least one of the killers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supporting characters include a police chief, an assistant district attorney, and the high school janitor that the killers pin the murder on. The movie reminds me of various `Hitchcock&#39; movies crossed with the TV show `Law and Order&#39;. We see a fair bit of police work and it is really interesting to see which clues the detectives follow and which ones they don&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other plot in the movie relates to Cassie Mayweather&#39;s past and incarcerated ex-husband. Most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessary and slow moving, but I found this to the most intriguing part of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;`Murder by Numbers&#39; is a nicely crafted movie if you are looking for safe, or should I say dangerous, murder mystery. For more thrills and suspense, try `Se7en&#39; or Hitchcock&#39;s `Dial M for Murder&#39;.

Story goes like this, Netflix was late sending me my dvds so I went on down to the the analog rental place known as &#34;Blockbuster Video&#34; They suck you know. Real bad, They have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for your viewing pleasure yet I never want to see any of those. So I saw BTK Killer there on the shelf, all by its lonesome self. I like seeing films based on serial killers. Its just a part of humanity that I will never understand, therefore I wanna see that kind of stuff. Anyways I put this DVD in and all the sudden from the very first second, it sucks. I&#39;m sitting there with my b.f. and we are like, &#34;what is this kind of crap?&#34; Unsteady camera operation, horrible acting,- the first scene in which a woman gets killed you wonder if she would rather just calmly gab instead, Then a rat gets stuffed down her throat. I really wonder if the director has a hard-on for this crap. There is nothing decent about this &#34;film&#34;. All I have to say to the director is &#34;do you own a freakin&#39; tripod?&#34; Every shot was brutally unstable. The music was awful. It was like they just decided one day to make a movie. They were probably gathering people from WalMart to show up and &#34;act&#34; for them. Just plain awful. If you make a movie like this then directing is your hobby-NOT what you should be doing for a living- SHould not make it to the DVD renal outlets for movie buffs like myself. Better left at home for your friends when you are having a party and run out of interesting things to entertain them with.... Then you break out your BTK KIller film and say, &#34;Wanna see this crappy movie I did once?&#34;

In this horrible attempt at a Blair Witch mockumentary, a bunch of people go to Africa to investigate a creature called the Half-Caste. It&#39;s pretty obvious that there was no script to speak of, and that everything was improvised. That can work if you have good actors, which this film didn&#39;t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie tries to gain points for originality by exploring a more obscure myth and an exotic culture. As a result, there are a lot of scenes out in the bush where characters do &#34;quirky African stuff&#34; like eating elephant dung. There is also some pretty good footage of lions eating (from a National Geographic perspective) but there&#39;s not a single scare in the whole movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;ve seen Cannibal Holocaust or the Blair Witch Project, this movie will hold no surprises for you, and you can probably watch better lion footage on the Discovery Channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a Half- Aste effort. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note to the filmmakers: guys, do us all a favor and next time save the &#34;How I spent my African Vacation&#34; home movie for your family and close friends. Nobody else wants to see it.

This is one of the worse movies that I have ever seen in my entire life. I wish I could travel back in time and do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Find out where the &#34;movie&#34; &#34;War Games- The Dead Code&#34; was filmed 2) Watch the original WAR GAMES with my current computer knowledge AND the eyes of a 1983 preteen. 3) Break into the pentagon computer in the 80&#39;s with the knowledge and perspective learned and remembered. 4) Reprogram the WHOPPER to NUKE the location of THE DEAD CODE minutes prior to its first day of filming 5) Come back to the present, have a beer and get Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to &#34;flash&#34; my memory blank of the whole event, especially my original viewing of &#34;The Dead Code&#34; 6) Have another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7) Be happy until the next bad remake of a GOOD 80&#39;s movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Did I forget the have Jar Jar killed. I am not sure if I would have to travel into the future for that. Maybe I need access to a wormhole.

This film is actually pertinent even today given the threat of bio-terrorism, and the threats of superbugs, West Nile Virus, and SARS. As a thriller, the tension is fairly intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than serviceable in their roles. The domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot. The actor in this film who most left his mark is Jack Palance. His sharply defined features and seemingly easygoing exterior always wither way to reveal the avaricious and cruel man beneath the surface. The chase scene through the packing plant is impressive even today. Recommended, 7/10.

The title is a reference to the destruction of the remnants of a harvest, like rice husks, by farmers who burn them creating fires on the plains. This is a bleak tale of the destruction of the Japanese soldier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is set in the closing days of the Philippines campaign as a soldier with TB who returns from a hospital because since he can walk, they have no room for him. His superior officers don&#39;t want him around since he&#39;s really too sick to work or fight. Abused by his officer he&#39;s sent back to the hospital with orders to either be admitted or kill himself. They still won&#39;t take him and he&#39;s soon left to wander across the war ravaged landscape trying to find help or a place to stay or even just food. Its a bleak journey with no hope in sight and only death and man&#39;s inhumanity to man at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billed as a harrowing journey into the dark heart of man and war this is also a very funny movie. This isn&#39;t to say its not horrifying, it is at times, but its also darkly comic. How could it not be? Here is a film where madness and insanity run rampant, people are constantly trying to hustle tobacco leaves for food, trying to get even a slightly better pair of shoes, trying to remain a Japanese soldier in the face of absurdity by marching constantly but never getting anywhere and you can&#39;t help but laugh. To be sure things go darker as it becomes clear that cannibalism maybe, literally and figuratively, the only way to survive, but at the same time there is something uncomfortably funny about the human comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hailed as a great anti-war film its stark photographic style makes clear the insanity of war even as it dazzles our eye with its beauty. Here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the civilian. set amid fields forests and trees that would otherwise be, and to some extent still are, quite beautiful. Its a jarring sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What intriguing is that I read that this is based on a novel about the redemptive power of Christianity. The director removed all over the religious references to hope and salvation and instead used it as to show that life stinks, war stinks worse and that there is, ultimately no hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intellectually I admire the film, emotionally I don&#39;t. Part of it is a strident downbeat score which, for me over accentuates what we are seeing on the screen. Its almost gilding the lily since the imagery is so strong it doesn&#39;t really need to have the music force you into feeling one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a great film, thats for you to decide. For certain its unlike any other war film, bloody, horrific and real in ways that big budgeted films claim to be but never are. This is not for those adverse to blood and gore since its here in spades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a look.

I thought that I was never going to find a horror movie as bad as &#34;The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#34;, but this film compete with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I´m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the Trance started. I woke up, and started to watching it agian. Why did I deserve that? All the movie was a torture, I have to use fast forward to watch it complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can´t stand why one of my favourites actors of all time (MR. WALKEN) could done this thing. I have to think that he made the director a favor, or he was really in the need of money, because film after film he is doing, he is ruining himself; and so fast...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about the movie? it´s not scary, stupid plot, characters are awful (but I really liked the one played by Jared Harris), effects are very poor, lack of deaths &amp; blood, etc; in three words, it has anything. And I mean it. Can´t stand how a director can make a film like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, When I got more disappointed was when I saw in the video cover, that the film was presented by &#34;Stephen King&#34;, I think he could never present this crap, no? (I rented it in Argentina). I not recommend it in a million years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this movie with a 2 out of 10. (As I say in my &#34;Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#34; review, there will be always a worse movies, thats why it don´t deserves a 1 out of 10)

This is the best version (so far) that you will see and the most true to the Bronte work. Dalton is a little tough to imagine as Rochester who Jane Eyre declared &#34;not handsome&#34;. But his acting overcomes this and Zelah Clark, pretty as she is, is also a complete and believable Jane Eyre. This production is a lengthy watch but well worth it. Nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true &#39;romance&#39; in literature, this is the way to see it. I own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original. The filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this.

This movie has got to go down in the history of bad movies as the worst one I&#39;ve ever seen. It wasn&#39;t even a bad b movie...I would have rated it at as a z. The special effects were ridiculous...err if you could even call them special effects. I think the reviewer before hit the nail on the head...it was the box that sold the movie, while the cover art was great and the synopsis intriguing (which both is why I rented it) it was a waste of not only time but money as well. I didn&#39;t last long. I took it back to the store and switched it out for another movie I believe my local video store took it off the shelf because they had SOOOO many complaints about this horrible movie. My 6 year old could have done a better job filming it/writing the script!

To start off, I love Steven Seagal, the man is a genius. But recent movies leave me to wonder, Is he trying anymore? His latest movies show almost no effort on Seagal&#39;s part. In Out of Reach, its too obvious that his lines are dubbed over. . What Seagal does in this movie is not only a slap on the face to his fans, but even more to Jean-Claude Van Damme and his fans. In the 2nd scene or so, when he prepares to zip-line into the drug dealers penthouse to steal the jewels and money, it shows him set-up the gun and hook it on a neon sign. Your might be saying to yourself, &#39;Yah, so what does this have to do with Van Damme?&#39;. Well that scene was stolen from a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie called the Order. Rent both, watch both, compare both and you will lose respect for Seagal. Not only was Today You Die garbage, but it was, dare I say, an insult. Seagal&#39;s Aikido moves are still good, but why isn&#39;t he doing great movies like Marked for Death or Above the law, hes still got the moves and the attitude, I&#39;m just left wondering &#39;Why Seagal, Why?&#39;. There are such idiotic scenes in his newer movies that have nothing to do with the storyline, and such idiotic story lines on top of that. I hope the up-coming Black Dawn movie will be another Exit Wounds or Beyond Justice, because these last chain of movies he made, especially Today You Die, really made me wonder if he has the stuff to make more great action movies like Double Team. Please, don&#39;t watch this movie unless you hate Seagal, if you love his movies don&#39;t watch this, it WILL make you question his future in the action film genre.

This movie is in the same league as Ishtar. Lots of wasted talent. Who let this bomb escape? When Sigfried says an example has to be made, in reference to a nuclear bomb, I said &#34;Please let it be this theatre!&#34; Don&#39;t waste your time. Not even worth a free rental! And where did they get these shills to fill the comments section on IMDb? I can&#39;t believe that anyone who has ever seen the original series enjoyed this stinker. Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. If they removed the &#34;comedy&#34; and made it a straight action movie, it could pass. What the heck was the purpose of the dance scene? Also, the fat jokes and references were tasteless. This movie never missed a chance to go for the lowest common denominator and scenes just ended, it seemed, as if no one thought them through. Just awful! Save your time, if not money and give this movie a pass!

Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It&#39;s so interesting to see how a world leader (like Chavez) who supports the poor people in his country, can be held in such low esteem in the US. His worst &#34;sin&#34;, in my opinion, is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel. What can be so bad about that? I have always been fascinated by the US government+media reaction to Fidel Castro. At first, Castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he supplanted Batista. Soon, however, Castro started turning the corporations in Cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats. We&#39;re a decent country, but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor? If these guys are &#34;dictators,&#34; then we could use more &#34;dictatorships&#34; especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.

I don&#39;t expect a lot from ghost stories, but I do expect a story to make a bit of sense! Is that asking too much from the screenwriters and filmmakers? When the bad guy, all of the sudden, becomes a homicidal maniac solely because a bunch of crows start pecking him, then I have a problem spending $9.00 for a ticket! Alfred Hitchcock would be spinning in his grave. Didn&#39;t anyone learn anything in their college Film 101 class? A good movie has at its roots an INTERESTING story!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the ridiculous messages in this movie: If you have desperate financial problems move from Chicago to the middle of no-where in North Dakota to grow Sunflowers (I kid you not!). If your toddler has serious neurological problems from a car accident move away from some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to an isolated small town, which, at best, has a community hospital. Hire a drifter to live &amp; work with you, out of the blue, without checking any references, when you have a teenage vixen daughter, a wife and toddler. ( I&#39;m glad they&#39;re not my parents!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A town where everyone knows everything would have no problem missing a triple homicide, just outside of town. And, of course, blame the man&#39;s lunacy on a bad crop of Sunflowers! (Doesn&#39;t anything else grow in North Dakota?) A couple of days after you buy your rundown house - with huge vines growing everywhere - that it reminds you of Jack and the Beanstalk, a guy from the X-Files, ala Smoking Man, (I&#39;m glad to see the cigarettes didn&#39;t get him, I guess he doesn&#39;t inhale!) will just suddenly sneak up on you while you&#39;re working to offer you the sale price of your home, plus 15% more, for absolutely no reason!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you get the picture. I have seen so many godforsaken awful movies in the past month, it just blows my mind! Is it that difficult to make a movie that doesn&#39;t treat the audience like an idiot? I&#39;m glad at least the crows in this sorry film turned out to have the some brains! I wish I could say the same for whomever thinks they are going to make money off this celluloid piece of trash!

The warmest, most engaging movie of its genre, Those Lips, Those Eyes, made me smile and cry as it reminded me of the work it takes to pursue a dream and the pain of disappointment. Hulce and Langella are superb and the story seems to write itself. A brilliant screenplay by David Shaber (one of my favorites! - see The Warriors and Nighthawks for more...) and beautiful sets filmed on location (I think) at the actual summer theater in which the story takes place. You can&#39;t see this movie and not want to drop everything and get into the theater! Please check this video out if you can find it.

Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) is a successful dentist, who shares his practice with other business partners. Alan also has an loving wife (Jada Pinkett Smith) and he has two daughter (Camille LaChe Smith &amp; Imani Hakim). He also let his parents stay in his huge apartment in New York City. But somehow, he feels that his life is somewhat empty. One ordinary day in the city, he sees his old college roommate Charlie Fireman (Adam Sandler). Which Alan hasn&#39;t seen Charlie in years. When Alan tries to befriends with Charlie again. Charlie is a lonely depressed man, who hides his true feelings from people who cares for him. Since Charlie unexpectedly loses his family in a plane crash, they were on one of the planes of September 11, 2001. When Alan nearly feels comfortable with Charlie. When Alan mentions things of his past, Charlie turns violent towards Alan or anyone who mentions his deceased family. Now Alan tries to help Charlie and tries to make his life a little easier for himself. But Alan finds out making Charlie talking about his true feelings is more difficult than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written and Directed by Mike Bender (Blankman, Indian Summer, The Upside of Anger) made an wonderfully touching human drama that moments of sadness, truth and comedy as well. Sandler offers an impressive dramatic performance, which Sandler offers more in his dramatic role than he did on Paul Thomas Anderson&#39;s Punch-Drunk Love. Cheadle is excellent as usual. Pinkett Smith is fine as Alan&#39;s supportive wife, Liv Tyler is also good as the young psychiatrist and Saffron Burrows is quite good as the beautiful odd lonely woman, who has a wild crush on Alan. This film was sadly an box office disappointment, despite it had some great reviews. The cast are first-rate here, the writing &amp; director is wonderful and Russ T. Alsobrook&#39;s terrific Widescreen Cinematography. The movie has great NYC locations, which the film makes New York a beautiful city to look at in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also an jam session with Sandler &amp; Cheadle, an featurette, photo montage and previews. I was expecting more for the DVD features like an audio commentary track by the director and deleted scenes. &#34;Reign Over Me&#34; is certainly one of the best films that came out this year. I am sure, this movie looked great in the big screen. Which sadly, i haven&#39;t had a chance to see it in a theater. But it is also the kind of movie that plays well on DVD. The film has an good soundtrack as well and it has plenty of familiar faces in supporting roles and bit-parts. Even the director has a bit-part as Byran Sugarman, who&#39;s an actor himself. &#34;Reign Over Me&#34; is one of the most underrated pictures of this year. It is also the best Sandler film in my taste since &#34;The Wedding Singer&#34;. Don&#39;t miss it. HD Widescreen. (**** 1/2 out of *****).

Despite later claims, this early-talkie melodrama has very little in common with &#34;Citizen Kane&#34;: It&#39;s a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat, told in flashback but hopping around time. The scriptwriter, Preston Sturges, shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog, and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of &#34;Kane&#34; are evident. Still, it&#39;s very watchable, with a young Spencer Tracy (his old-man makeup makes him look just like, well, an old Spencer Tracy) showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore -- a little past her prime, and not physically well matched -- playing a multifaceted woman-behind-the-man. There&#39;s also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history, sending the final third into ecstatic soap-opera reverberations. The surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets, and there are some plot holes left open (how would she know whose son it was if she&#39;s sleeping with both of them?), and the music is awfully hokey. For all that, I was quite fascinated.

(First of all, excuse my bad English) Of course only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include serious goofs like this.. I&#39;m a norwegian and I felt offended and shocked the makers of this movie did not take the time to do their research upon making this American/&#34;Norwegian&#34; movie. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#39;m posting my corrections out of my frustration: -The Country is named Norway, not Norwegia. -&#34;Da&#34; is Russian, not norwegian. -Norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far -It&#39;s true we have a native traditional folk-outfit (that we only use like twice a year) but the outfit in this movie is more like a German outfit. -I could NOT understand the so called &#34;norwegian&#34; in this movie.. Jessica was not making any sense.. neighter did the &#34;norwegian priests&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I recognise is the norwegian flag (and the viking hats, but that&#39;s so stereotypic what people think about norway - vikings!:O gosh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well.. I guess the people who made this film will never read this comment. but at least I cleared some things up and got rid of some of that frustration..!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m proud of my country and I&#39;d love if people in the US were less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was all.. Lenge leve Norge ! ;p

&#39;&#39;The 40 Year Old Virgin&#39;&#39;&#39;made me laugh a lot. I don&#39;t care if it is considered to be a very sexual comedy, I just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as the virgin nerd Andy Stitzer and I think the scene where Andy has his chest hair removed by wax one of the coolest, specially because it is real. Many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famous,by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. He is a little bit strange and collects lots of toys, but seems harmless. One day, while playing poker with his friends of his work, they discover that Andy is in fact...virgin! And he is already 40 years old! After this surprising revelation, all his friends are trying to make Andy sleep with a woman...the problem is the confusions in which Andy gets in,specially now that he is really starting to like Trish, a woman he met when she was buying a DVD player in the store he works at.

Though not a Greek I have had a lifelong interest in the Eastern Empire. Its fall in 1453 was the Greatest loss to Christianity in its entire history. Yet while the Easter Empire is not a topic much discussed in American intellectual circles, the US did not merely mimic Golden Byzantiums public architecture, the US is much absorbed in the fated Byzantine historical cycle and now has faced many of the crises involving certain people of a middle eastern extraction about whom it is said that there is a slight tendency for excessive exuberance on religious matters which humbled Great Byzantium. I wonder if the loss of the ability to speak plainly was the first sign post on the road to disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Romer is to be credited not only for his excellent production but also for his joyful enthusiasm for the subject which is most refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for Americans who like political correctness.

So, I know that I voted 1 out of 10 but really this deserves no more than half of a star. I hated it. It was so stupid and unrealistic, I can&#39;t believe any of the stars signed on to make this ridiculously absurd project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James G. and Cathrine O&#39;Hara were excellent in their characters and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were just as good too, but the story sucked and I encourage anyone who sees this in the video store to not even bother picking it up and reading the back cover, but to just walk away...I don&#39;t even want to get into what the movie is about, because it is too stupid to pontificate about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t rent this! It&#39;s horrible! Horrible!

&#34;Telefilms&#34; tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule, which is why this film always tends to buck the trend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George C. Scott embodies Ebenezer Scrooge perfectly, fully encompassing all of his cold tendencies, and still makes him a simpathetic character. The production value for this film was exceptional, never relying on boffo special effects or soundstage set-ups, yet relying on the depth and clarity of on-site shooting and strong backdrops. A movie that certainly stands alone.

Recently shown on cable tv the movie opens with a disclaimer distancing itself from any co-operation of real life persons; that in itself is an eye catcher. Yet the script and acting from the main characters is superb and I found myself engrossed throughout.Due in no small way to the crisp, thoughtful and interesting dialogue.The film is about a meeting on one day between two real life musical &#34;legends&#34; who formerly composed together then seperated.The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies, in a story which proffers an explanation for their initial &#34;split&#34;. What is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they play,faults and all, that this viewer at least was left believing I was witnessing a true event in almost every detail. The great skill of this play is that with astute writing and fine acting a movie basically about &#34;two of us&#34; talking can make an excellent picture. Worthy of at least an 8 out of 10.

I&#39;ve been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80&#39;s. I say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre I&#39;m not particularly interested in. The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it&#39;s Franco-Italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today. It is truly one of my great &#34;guilty pleasures&#34;. I was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than I think is healthy. A worthwhile moodpiece.

A proof that it&#39;s not necessary for a movie to have a deep many-layered story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie. Even if the story could be expanded in many directions, especially in more sociological way (people lust for money) it seems that it&#39;s perfect just the way it is. Through many sudden changes it takes the spectator to the end without any unnecessary complications and without letting the spectator taking the eyes of the screen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the acting for me isn&#39;t so good. With the exception of Lindsey McKeon the others were average or even worst. In some scenes they just empty-stared in front of themselves. For exception of Lindsey which was more convincing. It&#39;s a really simple movie for just laying back and enjoying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10

Adela is a rebellious teenager with the attitude that she is right and everyone else is wrong. She needs to be the center of attention and she&#39;ll act stupid to make it so. With her attitude she gets sent to charm school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There she meets the typical characters in today&#39;s cinema; the nerd, the clumsy one, the stepford housewife and the sexual minority. Things happen and in the end Adela &#34;learns her lesson&#34; so to speak. The plot tries to carry a deeper meaning to the state Adela is in, but utterly fails to deliver (at least I didn&#39;t buy it). So what you are left with is superficial interaction within the same stereotypes you&#39;ve seen in a million movies before. Plus the director seems to have a breast fixation, Adela flashes her boobies a few times too many, at least I can&#39;t see that they are relevant to the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the film is OK, but if you are like me and don&#39;t like to watch a teenager pissing people off and making a behavioral U-turn in an instant, which I found very unbelievable, think twice before watching.

This was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store. Don&#39;t make the same mistake I did. This movie is tedious, unconvincingly acted, and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered; I cringed at every scene they shared. Dennis Hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self; his role was clearly not a stretch for him. And although the movie is supposedly set in Puerto Rico, it feels a lot more like a Hollywood movie lot; all of the main characters are Caucasian and several tend to speak English with pseudo-Irish accents. Odd. Anyway, when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store, keep walking.

Although I think the reviewers who hated this movie have encapsulated exactly what it does wrong (everything!), I had to add my two cents. If you&#39;d like a long version of how terrible this movie is, please read the review by coinlightning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s the short version: shameless use of the actors&#39; NAMES to propel the plot as opposed to using their talent (no one brought their &#34;A game&#34; to this), blatant commercialism (I guess Pepsi can afford to stick an advertisement - or 40 - into a movie now), and a plot (???) that was so convoluted with &#34;rock star&#34; clichés that it was totally ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me put it to you this way . . . I was thinking of &#39;Wayne&#39;s World&#39; the whole time I was watching this movie, but I wasn&#39;t laughing! Anytime you try to throw in Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) to help your movie plot along you&#39;ve got SERIOUS problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE, warn your friends and family - this movie sucks.

This film just goes to prove that not every film made during the glory days of Hollywood is worth seeing. Just because you&#39;ve got an excellent ensemble cast doesn&#39;t mean that this can overcome a script that was probably written by a chimp! Think about it--the film featured Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Charles Boyer, Gloria Graham, Lillian Gish and Paul Stewart and yet it still was a bad film! The basic premise of the film isn&#39;t bad--a private psychiatric hospital where the staff are more screwed up than the patients! Also, the subplot involving the overworked husband and wife (Widmark and Graham) had a lot of promise. However, the script was handled with all the finesse and deftness of a drunk buffalo--with bellicose and way over the top scenes again and again in the film. In fact, it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of &#34;General Hospital&#34;. Subtle, this film ain&#39;t!! Realistic, this film ain&#39;t!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While most of the reason this film reeked was the awful script, but I also blame the producers as well for miscasting and misusing come veteran actors. For example, Paul Stewart may not be a household name but this character actor had exceptional talent--especially when playing gangsters in Film Noir movies. Yet here, Stewart is cast as a very nondescript psychiatrist with some bizarre European accent--it just didn&#39;t work since this was well outside his acting range and his character was totally undeveloped and one-dimensional. Also, Charles Boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place. Seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heartland of America just seemed bizarre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a rather awful film. It is very watchable in a train wreck sort of way but it certainly isn&#39;t very pretty. My wife and I disliked much of the movie but also felt it could have been very good had the writing been competent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS--In a case of art imitating life, Oscar Levant played one of the patients. In real life, the brilliant Levant spent much of his life in and out of mental institutions.

I wanted to see this movie because I am a very huge Abbott and Costello fan, and when I saw it, I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is funny, not hysterical, but funny. I mean I laughed at a lot of the funny parts and I just plain enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it is not of the best of the Perfect Straight Man and the Perfect Buffoon, you should see this if you really love Abbott and Costello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all of the Abbott and Costello movies that I have seen, I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve seen one that I hated. This is decent, funny, and entertaining. Abbott and Costello at least made some pretty decent movies in their later years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I liked this movie, it is not one of their best ones, but I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10

A struggling actor finds the best way to break into Hollywood is to start knocking off the competition. But what makes Break a Leg a real gem is the sardonic look into the existence of the struggling (and not so) LA actor. It brings us into that world with effortless irony and wit. It&#39;s also got a polished look and very adept direction under Monika Mitchell. Break a Leg is one of those rare independent films that doesn&#39;t compromise its production values at any level. The writing is tight, the dialogue first rate. Cassini is an actor&#39;s actor, and the role really shows off his talents. The climactic scene between him and Rene Garcia is an instant classic, and may go down as one of the funniest Hollywood scenes of all time. I saw it at an advanced screening, and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards.

Elvira(Cassandra Peterson) is the host of a cheap horror show. After she finds out that her dead aunt has left her some stuff, elvira goes to England to pick it up, hoping it will be some money. But to her horror, elvira finds out that all her aunt has left her is her house, her dog and a cookbook. Elvira decides to settle in the house anyways, but with her striking dark looks and her stunning features, she will not be able to live in peace. All the neighbours are now turning the whole town against her, and with Elvira&#39;s outrageous attitude and looks, everyone better watch out, because Elvira is on Fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it&#39;s really fun to watch get Elvira into all these adventures, she&#39;s just great. The whole movie puts you into a halloween mood, sure, it&#39;s silly and the jokes are cheap but it&#39;s a pleasure to watch it. I would give Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark 8/10

Impressive vision indeed, and some hot chicks with swords flying around, oh and those hypnotic Chinese violins too... Let me think, &#34;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#34;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kinda liked CTHD, with its down-to-earth simplicity and well developed characters, that still left enough room for you to enjoy the vision without having to think about the DEEEPAA Meaning of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Hero&#34; on the other hand is painfully pretentious and demanding both visually and conceptually. The larger-than-life moral was horrible. I mean, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your beliefs, sacrifice your love so that your mighty nation can succeed???? WTF??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, hay, Mao and G.W.B. would be proud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viva

...and in this series, I&#39;ve been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle. Remember my friend Marco, who got all the good lines in the books? Well, in this series his one-liners put Mr. Freeze to shame. Remember our uber-evil nemesis Visser Three? He&#39;s a bald guy with inane catchphrases. Remember Rachel, &#34;Xena, the Warrior Princess&#34;, and Cassie, my sensitive and caring love interest? They&#39;ve been turned into mindless bimbos by the 10 (!) writers who decided the original characters weren&#39;t cool enough for TV. Remember the awesome extra-terrestial Ax, who was cool, intelligent, and really, really liked cinnamon buns? In this series he&#39;s the Token Alien with an extremely annoying voice. Remember the witty banter our team had in the books? In this series our dialogue is so dreary and stupid it&#39;s obvious the writers were pandering to the lowest common denominator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So forget everything you thought you knew about the Animorphs! It was Cassie who became allergic to morphing, not Rachel, thought-speak is *supposed* to echo, and Visser Three and Ax, rarely, if ever, appeared as Andalites (no, it has nothing to do with the budget!). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not crazy. And I&#39;m not lying. The jerks are all around us. And if you&#39;re unlucky, one of them might adapt one of your favourite books, or series, or graphic novels, into a really awful TV show. You&#39;ve been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Finally... television worth watching.&#34; ~ (the very bald) Visser Three&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(r#91)

With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends &amp; Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty&#39;s $24 million as opposed to Company&#39;s measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing. Nurse Betty is one of the darkest comedies to be advertised towards a mainstream audience in years, and considering its moderate box office and critical success, perhaps moviegoers weren&#39;t as dumb and brainwashed as we though they were. The story follows (both figuratively AND literally) a naive waitress (Zellweger) who has fallen in love from afar with a handsome soap star (As Good As It Gets&#39;s Greg Kinnear) but is trapped in a loveless marriage to a slimy car dealer (Aaron Eckhart, who made his big-screen debut in Company). When her husband is gruesomely murdered by two hitmen (Freeman and Rock), she&#39;s sent into shock and obliviously sets out for Hollywood to meet her object of affection -- unaware that he&#39;s only an actor. When Freeman and Rock discover that the car she took contains 10 kilos of cocaine, they hit the road as well and outrageousness ensues. Fans of LaBute&#39;s previous work might have a hard time figuring out how this could possibly be the same guy who directed In the Company of Men -- a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs who play a practical joke on a deaf co-worker --, but when you think about it, the connection is rather clear: in Company, a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is being ruthlessly taken advantage of. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she&#39;s chasing thinks her genuine adoration is nothing more than a joke. Some might begin to wonder if LaBute is really some sort of misogynist himself -- considering that his recurring theme involves the downfall of innocent women. But personally, I think he&#39;s coming to the defense of the fair sex and dealing far more harshly with the abusers in his pictures than the abused. One of the many charms of this film is that it&#39;s absurdity is full-fledged: most directors, when handling a script such as this one, would leave the story at two hitmen chasing a woman chasing a dream. But LaBute knows better, and has one of the hitmen (Freeman) fall obsessively for Betty as well. This was an interesting role for Freeman to take, because it allowed him to play off of his trademark `this-is-the-last-time&#39; character (see Unforgiven, Se7en, and 1998&#39;s stinker Hard Rain); the supporting cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney, and `Mad About You&#39;s Kathleen Wilhoite. The script, written by first-timers John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is deliriously over-the-top (honestly: have you ever seen a comedy -- or ANY movie, for that matter -- in which a man is scalped in his own dining room?). You could argue that the ending is a little too perfect, but it&#39;s really not worth denying everything that&#39;s great about the film for one trivial complaint. If Nurse Betty is any sign of what LaBute has in store for us next, you can bet that I&#39;ll be lining up for whatever he decides to follow it up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A-

Only three words are really required for this review: Piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoyed watching the cartoon as a child, you will find this movie to be a complete waste of your time and money. The best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet sticking to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they do use all of the names and catch phrases. The even name the dog &#34;Shoeshine&#34; (in reference to the dog being &#34;Shoeshine Boy&#34; in the cartoon). They name the love interest Polly, but she isn&#39;t Miss Sweet Polly Purebred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and son drug me to see this. They should have drugged me to see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original Underdog was voiced by Wally Cox, the ultimate nerd. This one is voiced by someone with a &#34;smart alleck teenager that knows more than all the adults&#34; attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a stand alone movie, it is awful. As an homage to Underdog, it is even worse. It is not an homage. It is not a retelling of the story. It is not an updating of the story. It is purely an attempt to cash in on a known title and create merchandising. The next time I go to the store, I fear that I will see Underdog toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothing, etc. McDonalds and Burger King probably fought over the kid&#39;s meal rights for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part of this movie, however, is the soundtrack. THEY DO THE UNDERDOG THEME SONG TO RAP (read that with a silent &#34;C&#34; at the beginning)! Great, now that we are going to destroy something, let&#39;s go all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew that it would probably be bad before I went. My fears were confirmed when I arrived at my local 12 plex and found that they opened it for the first day and first showing in their smallest auditorium (and one of only four without stadium seating). Even the theatre people knew it was going to be garbage! Save your money on the tickets and invest it better by going out and buying the original series on DVD. It will be more entertaining and have better production values.

I&#39;m sorry, but this really does feel like a modern day Apollo 13 knock-off. Totally implausible (at least Armageddon FELT like a comic book! This felt like a bad High School film project), acting was about as cliché as one can get, and....landing a space shuttle on an LA freeway? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what were you thinking? And all the clichés: The pregnant astronaut&#39;s wife, the nosy reporter who gets in everyone&#39;s way, the stalwart manager with &#34;Go Fever&#34;. And it&#39;s one thing to twist the laws of physics or politics or whatever to make an entertaining story, but at least make it GOOD! Fact and science were totally butchered for this. The space shuttle doesn&#39;t have fuel tanks in it&#39;s wings, and even if it did, it couldn&#39;t steer by shifting fuel between them (and neither could a DC-10).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like bad acting, bad storytelling, low realism, and cheesy clichés, this one can&#39;t be beat!

I borrowed this movie from library think it might be delightful. How wrong am I!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is such a bad movie that I have to write something about it. Mira Sorvino is SO bad in the movie, it is very painful to watch the scene with her. She is a pretty girl, but in this movie, She is not seductive at all, but I will have to witness her awkward attempt to seduce almost all the other major characters. It is so ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the dialog of the film is so pretentious, and lack the humorous fact that make then acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally failure.

I sat last night to see this film being played in Greek television because of the upcoming Olympic Games hosted by my city.Knowing that it is an American film, i had already expected it to focus more on the American athletes story.And i was really ready for it. But what i saw was..., too much!I mean, when a movie has such a title (&#34;First Olympics: Athens 1896&#34;), even being of American origin, you would not expect it to be so propagandizing and, on the same time, ignorant towards other countries&#39; athletes and efforts.The American athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature (strength, smartness, generosity, kindness, politeness...), in contrast to their &#34;sin-athletes&#34; in the Games, who seem being unable even to... speak their thoughts or express feelings.The number of times the American anthem is played during the film must be an all time record in filmography.Megalomania at it&#39;s best!It even uses fictionalized facts which ridicules the Greek nation, such as Greek citizens serving the foreign Marathon athletes with wine, in order to help the domestic ones win the race.So much for the Olympic spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of it.Being a Greek and putting a bad mark to a movie whose title is also Greek is something that doesn&#39;t make me happy at all.But according to what i have seen, i cannot give it more than 4 out of 10 (being pretty generous actually).

The only reason I gave this episode of &#34;Masters of Horror&#34; a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two lead actors are good, and it wasn&#39;t shot on VHS. The story, the dialog, and the plot are ridiculous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking / Driving zombies who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war! Give me a break! What next, zombies who come back to go skydiving? Maybe zombies who come back to host QVC shows? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never supported the Iraq war, but I do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces; and &#34;Homecoming&#34; was disrespectful in that it mocks the TRUE horror of war. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With zombies being mass produced in today&#39;s market... this is the SPAM of zombie-related entertainment. How &#34;Homecoming&#34; made it onto &#34;Masters of Horror&#34; is beyond me.

I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction. I could not do that with this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as one of the finer films of this genre.

The greatest sin in life is being dull, and this movie is crashingly boring. its funny, its left out of his &#34;a life in film&#34; documentary. He goes from a long piece on &#34;Stardust Memories&#34; and then fast forwards to &#34;Zelig&#34;. This little piece of cubic zirconia just isn&#39;t worth the effort.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I suppose this is not the best film ever made but I voted it at 10 stars all the same. Mainly because of my feelings at the end. I and all the people around me were simply touched. This is something you don&#39;t often feel . We are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films. The story of the film centres around Jane a young woman in the last stages of MND and the friendship that grows between her and Richard, a man on the verge of a breakdown. This could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous, humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting from Branagh and Bonham-Carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role. The chemistry between the two also lifts the movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title comes from Richards masterpiece, a plane made of junk and his old paintings. Flying here is a symbol for both Richards and Janes living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A beautiful and funny movie that I would recommend to anyone. don&#39;t let the subject matter put you off.

I saw Forgiving the Franklins at a Paramount screening and loved it I have to be honest I really didn&#39;t want to go and I had become quite jaded about the movies being made today I have to tell you Forgiving The Franklins was fresh and wonderfully put together I laughed my ass off it was great story telling I could not believe two guys shot this and put the whole thing together. I thought if these guys can do a movie like this with this budget imagine what they could do with big money behind them. And then I thought be the jaded guy Iam the studios would probably f...it up anyway. That being said thanks guys I got lost and in your film and that&#39;s why I go to the movies to forget the world for a couple of hours.

Let me tell you a story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day on the streets of Athens a film director bumped into a male prostitute and decided that the world just HAD to know his story because...you know... he&#39;s deprived...and he takes his shirt off a lot and...so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is the result of his revelation. Repulsive, depraved, homophobic, misogynist...but of course filled with pretty guys with their chests showing. If this is your idea of a good film then enjoy, if not avoid it like the plague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s put me off ever going to Greece that&#39;s for sure.

The Rookie kept me smiling from beginning to end. Dennis Quaid played the role to perfection. The little boy that plays his son was fantastic. He made this a father-son movie to remember. The messages are good ones. Follow your dreams. Failing at the pursuit is alright as long as you try. The excitement is palpable. I believe this movie will be a classic.

Okay, I&#39;m sorry to the cast and crew for this review, but this movie is by far the worst I&#39;ve seen yet...First off, the acting was okay. It could of been better (especially in some parts), but it was &#34;okay&#34;. Then, there was the cheapest video camera (which they used). The violence was pretty good. If it were paced faster, it would be awesome, but they didn&#39;t (*sigh*)...Scares. The scares were well written (in the script), but not well done. For instance...(SPOILER HERE!) In the loft, a girl is half way in it and the other half is in the dark, bottom area of the barn house, then she gets it. The monster yanks her down and then you hear someones guts getting ripped out. The scares could have been better if the music wasn&#39;t ripped from a cheap horror sounds CD. The blood effects were pretty good, but the blood was like that of &#34;Kill Bill&#34;. K.B. pulled it off, because it was meant to resemble old kung-fu movies, but when the crew can&#39;t tell the difference between red and pink....it&#39;s sad. The ripped up bodies in the movie were good, but the scarecrow costumes were something you would see for 25 bucks at a halloween store. Don&#39;t let the cover fool you, the costumes suck! My overall grade is a 3/10. If you are interested in independent movies, are easily satisfied, or just have 3 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, go to Blockbuster and see the horror of failure.

I had expected a fairly straightforward R-rated graphic, sexual, crude teen-comedy when I sat down to see this... it turned out to be fairly accurate... only it was far more sick and disgusting than I would have thought. I don&#39;t know if the director/writer Gregory Poirier is sick or deeply messed up sexually, but I doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this. I could probably have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was it was that it required a tough stomach... but it isn&#39;t. The film is also horribly mean-spirited and disturbing... every single character that has more than one full second of time on-screen is an extreme... sexually, mentally or physically. I don&#39;t know if this is just the director&#39;s sense of humor, but I just found it to be... wrong. Just wrong. Even in a comedy, there is supposed to be some seriousness. The plot is stupid. The acting is bad. The characters are inconsistent and poorly written... all of them. There isn&#39;t one single likable character in the film. The humor is disgusting and goes way too far. The film is just so incredibly poorly done that I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth anyone&#39;s time. If you like R-rated, crude comedies with plenty of sexual innuendo and graphic stuff, watch The Groomsmen, or, better yet, American Pie... or Road Trip, my personal favorite. But don&#39;t watch this. I can&#39;t possibly describe to you how bad it is... you would have to experience it for yourself. However, this is one of those times where I&#39;ll say that you&#39;re better off wondering. That way you can just imagine that this film goes very close to the bottom... without knowing that it goes through it, and far lower than that. This movie most of all looks like a group of horny teenage guys got together, put together a film crew, and every-time one of them got an idea, they filmed it, and later put the entire thing together. It lacks structure, consistency and taste. I recommend this only to horny teenage guys who have seen every single other R-rated crude teen comedy and who don&#39;t care about quality. Everyone else... do the sensible thing; avoid this. It&#39;s not even worth it to see the booty. Believe me. 1/10

Den Brysomme Mannen is one of the better films of all time and is about a man trapped in a world where there are no senses, no feelings, no Love, no Truth and definitely no Freedom. A world where people become afraid when someone speaks their mind, expresses himself or show affection, a world where no one is Free and no one has any idea what the Meaning of any of this is. Just like the world we live in, the world in Den Brysomme Mannen is a world of lost souls trying to become fulfilled but focus on the complete opposite of what fulfills them, materialism, social acceptance and mediocre satisfactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Den Brysomme Mannen deserves full attention by every human soul, because we could all use a fresh Wake Up call.

Two things are changed from then.First of all i am not a kid anymore,and second most of new Seagal movies are just terrible.This is on my opinion the worst movie ever made with Derailed starred by Jean Claude Van Damme.There is no plot in this movie,the plot is just an excuse to shoot some terrible action scenes which are painful to watch.I love action movies,but this is not an action movie....This isn&#39;t a movie...this is a group of irritating scenes which are connected in annoying way to kill the viewers love for the action movies.I am sorry but i don&#39;t have any respect for anyone who liked this movie.He has a serious intelligence problem then.I hope that Seagal will make some new good movies in the future.Good luck for him !

Gunga Din (1939) is based on Rudyard Kipling&#39;s poem.The movie is directed by George Stevens.It&#39;s set in India during the 19th century where three British soldiers have to stop an evil guru and his murderous cult.Gunga Din is a marvelous adventure war comedy with plenty of thrilling moments.The three leading men are brilliant.Cary Grant is Sgt.Archibald Cutter, Victor McLaglen is Sgt.&#39;Mac&#39; MacChesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.(the son of the legendary you know who) is Sgt.Thomas Ballantine.Let&#39;s not forget the other fine players who include Sam Jaffe playing Gunga Din himself in a brilliant way.The beautiful and gifted Joan Fontaine is Emaline Stebbins.It&#39;s awfully fun to watch the difficulties of Tommy&#39;s and Emmy&#39;s wedding plans.Gunga Din is awfully lot of fun.It can be funny, it can be thrilling.It can be everything a good movie requires.

i was a huge fan of this series. Yesterday i watched it again on DVD. I was apprehensive about whether laughs would come or not? But in a few episodes i was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good. Acting wise Rakesh Bedi(Raja} &amp; Satish Shah is brilliant whereas Swaroop Sampat is plain bad but I think she gets the job done. Maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her. This series shows what good, clean comedy is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this series were to air in the current year I would have given it 9/10. And to think that this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good. I give it 10/10. I would highly recommend this series for watching on DVD.

I began riding horses fairly recently, and, as anyone who has ever ridden should know, I fell in love with horses and their world. I rented Spirit on a whim, just trying to pack my life full of as much horse related material as I could, and I was surprised by the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I expected was a feel-good Disneyesque movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got was an amazing film, filled with beautiful scenery and animation, and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm one&#39;s heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, whose entire world is brought crumbling down around him when he discovers the humans slowly taking over his homeland. The story unfolds with a wide array of characters, some human, some animals, all are well written and most are pleasant to watch on screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story, and who has an appreciation for history and animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I forgot to mention, but that I feel is important, is that the animals in this film do not talk. This was a really nice vacation from the Lady And The Tramp animated movies that everyone today is used to.

We thought this was one of the worst movies ever. I had to volunteer to watch the end. The romance was not believable; the characters were not developed; the love affair made hardly any sense; it was miscast; and scenery was absolutely stupid because it was either (my opinion) like the ADAMS FAMILY GOES ON VACATION...just creepy, gypsy and cheesy; and the OUTERBANKS does not look typically like those houses on the surf; and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it was not theirs. Also..it was not realistic. hurrricanes give you plenty of notice to batten down the hatches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the friend was superfluous; and did not match the story What did the civil war have to do with the outerbanks anyway? I also have to mention the wardrobe...did D. Lane have to have a scarf/pashmina/shawl on in every scene? It was overdone. She looked good enough to not have to hide things; without making them obvious like with light slacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I am concerned with the impact on our landfills when everyone has to dispose of this stupid, and I mean STUPID movie!!!! Don&#39;t fall for the hype on this one!!!!!! We did. Not even watchable.

Rod Serling was, of course, a genius and his wonderful, playful, creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television at that state of development. There are no such shows now, but rather &#34;Housewife&#34; sluts ala Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the pitiful stabs at humor and witty banter that litter our high-tech screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Elam edged into the episode with such acting precision and with his usual craziness that I can&#39;t help but think that Rod Serling was tailoring that long ago week&#39;s show around Elam, even though he was an ancillary to the flow of the story. This episode ends with a twist, as usual, but shock and humor are mixed with especially &#34;Serlingesque&#34; dexterity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rex Lewis Field

My wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store. From the cover it looked like a science-fiction film, but upon turning it over my wife saw Rebecca St. James was in the film, realized it was a Christian movie, and suggested we watch it. We are conservative evangelicals but we also know that &#34;Christian&#34; films have a poor reputation in the mainstream. Nevertheless, we decided to give it a screening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, there were a few things I liked about the film. The musical score - much of which was orchestrated - was quite good. The cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lower-budget movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, any virtue in this film&#39;s production work was lost on a regrettable script. The film begins with an interesting premise - UFO abductions - but by midway through the feature the storyline veers wildly into an evangelistic crusade spearheaded by the movie&#39;s two main characters... which then veers wildly into a treatise on the Rapture. At least the Frank Peretti-inspired &#34;The Visitation&#34; (which was itself a deeply flawed film) had an endgame that tied together the movie&#39;s premise. &#34;Unidentified&#34; ends nowhere even close to where it started, which is a huge letdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the acting? The supporting acting ranges from decent to awful. (Rebecca St. James plays a bit part and is passable.) For their part, a few of the main characters are manned capably enough. Sadly, their talents are wasted on characters so one-dimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable. The &#34;protagonists&#34; are anything but; you know it&#39;s bad when two Christian viewers find the most vocal Christian character in the film to be the most annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie, which will be of more interest to Christian than non-Christian readers. In a word, it is embarrassing. Other Christian films like Carmen&#39;s &#34;The Champion&#34; and Peretti&#39;s &#34;The Hangman&#39;s Curse&#34; have managed to communicate a genuinely uncompromising portrait of the Christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive. This film, by contrast, is a sledgehammer that feels so heavy-handed and lacking in tact that a non-Christian would have a hard time taking it seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that the filmmaker&#39;s heart is in the right place, and I applaud efforts to create good Christian film. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. If your church is looking for a screening of a good Christian film, consider &#34;Mercy Streets,&#34; the aforementioned &#34;The Champion,&#34; or (if you&#39;re Pentecostal) Robert Duvall&#39;s provocative &#34;The Apostle.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for &#34;Unidentified?&#34; Rent it if you must, but screen it before you show it to a non-Christian or a larger audience.

My siblings and I stumbled upon The Champions when our local station aired re-runs of it one summer in the 1970&#39;s. We absolutely adored it. There was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially when compared to the usual American re-runs (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres... you get the idea). It had a similar feel to The Avengers (not too much of a surprise, since it was also British and in the spy/adventure genre).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see it again now -- hopefully it holds up. I&#39;ve mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it, so I began to wonder if I&#39;d imagined its whole existence. But the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it. Hopefully it will find a new generation of fans.

Now, I haven&#39;t read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so I&#39;m not going to go down that path here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have some time ago learnt that Stephen King movies simply -are not- horror films, with perhaps a couple of exceptions. This was not one of them. It started well enough, and for once I&#39;m not going to complain about the acting, although Fred Gwynne was as usual wonderful.. Also I will forgive the total lack of parenting skills, as they were necessary to make the story here move forward...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there was one consistent point that I couldn&#39;t help but get annoyed with. And that came pretty close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity. The moments I refer to are thus: There is a tiny zombie running around the house. You suspect it is under the bed. Do you &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(a) get as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover up, exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a teeny undead cannibal might inflict on you, or &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(b) move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the completely open end from a position of slightly increased safety, or at least see the mini terror coming at you, giving you a little reaction time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, let&#39;s go with (a). I feel like offering myself up for the slaughter today. Bleh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun enough film though... Just not very scary.

This film is excellently paced, you never have to wait for a belly laugh to come up for more than about a minute and there&#39;s much more going on than the initial premise of the film. Throughout it there are mockeries of the traditional schmaltzy local-boys-done-good-overcoming-adversity genre of which this parodies. Don&#39;t let anyone tell you that they&#39;re trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities;- sure, there&#39;s plenty of that but it&#39;s all contextual, not gratuitous. I loved this film and it only cost me £2.99 on DVD , so in terms of entertainment value for money, it has been the best film I&#39;ve seen this year.

This movie is just crap. Even though the directors claim to be part of that oi-culture, it&#39;s still a very, very bad directorial debut. The topic itself is very interesting and I accept the bad acting due to the fact, that they are all amateurs and never acted before, but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing. There&#39;s no timing at all in that movie. I felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie (it&#39;s their first feature), that they actually never really asked themselves, what story they wanna tell. I met Ben (one of the directors) on several occasions and he&#39;s a nice and thoughtful guy, but that doesn&#39;t make him a director. I think, that &#34;American History X&#34; is full of clichés, but somehow manages to transport a story. &#34;Oi!Warning&#34; is full of clichés, doesn&#39;t tell anything new or provocative and (-that&#39;s the sad thing about this movie) it&#39;s far from any Oi!-Reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wanna see weird but great German films, watch the movies of Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benny&#39;s Video Funny Games Die Unberührbare Mein Letzter Film Das Experiment Das Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** out of ten, because of the topic and the photography

I decided to write a comment on this amazing movie because here on IMDb it is cited that John Woo, a mediocre director who made some decent films back in his pre-American years but totally ruined his reputation by his latest, made in US films, plans to remake it. Well, here are a couple of reasons why it is one of the stupidest ideas for a remake ever: The plot of the film is simple and even clichéd by today&#39;s standards, but what makes the film a masterpiece is acting by the four leads, unique direction by Mellville, cinematography, music and its style. There is no way any director today can make such film, it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in today&#39;s Box-office targeted movie business. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Woo did make a more or less decent film which borrowed from Melville&#39;s Le Samourai - The Killer, but remember, it was made when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and expensive (in salaries) but cheap (in acting merits) actors. So what I&#39;m saying is that this is one of the greatest films ever made, together with another film by Melville - Le Samourai. Watch it. And even if the remake will be made, try to avoid it before seeing the great original first.

Maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because I walked out well before the end. That&#39;s odd, because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen and I enjoyed Midsummers Night&#39;s Dream once, many years ago, when I saw it on the stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think that two things did me in: that squeaky twerp with the Shakespearian name, Calista Flockhart, and Michelle Feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell. Well, I suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy -- but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren&#39;t, I&#39;d say we have a bad movie on our hands....

I must warn you, there are some spoilers in it. But to start it off, I got &#34;Spanish Judges&#34; on February I think. It was mention it was the last copy, but as I see, it wasn&#39;t back-ordered. But either way, I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor, Matthew Lillard (I&#39;m surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar) although it is kind of low budget, getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending. Man, what a good actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story it about a con artist known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who &#34;claims&#34; to have merchandises called The Spanish Judges. If you don&#39;t know what Spanish Judges are or haven&#39;t seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read, I won&#39;t even say what they are. I figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was. He needs protection, so he hires a couple who are also crooks, Max and Jamie (Vincent D&#39;Onofrio and Valeria Golino) as well as a crook that goes by the name of Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a girlfriend who won&#39;t even tell anyone her name because she&#39;s from Mars, as she said. So they (mainly Jack) call her &#34;Mars Girl&#34;. Everything starts out fine, but then it turns to one big game. A game that involves some lust, lies and betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was some over acting in it (Matt and Valeria, as well as Tamara, were not one of them). There were some scenes they could&#39;ve done better and the score could&#39;ve been a little better as well. Some of the score was actually good. The theme they used for the beginning and the end (before the credits) was a good song choice, that&#39;s my opinion. The fight scene in the end could&#39;ve been a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do? One more comment on Matt: Damn, he plays a smooth, slick con man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a review, but I need to make a correction towards NeCRo, one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer. According to this site, she has been acting since 1983. To me, and hopefully to others, she is well known as Charlie Sheen&#39;s Italian love interest in both the &#34;Hot Shots!&#34; movies. But good review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I think it&#39;s one of the rare films I&#39;ve seen and it&#39;s really good (which is why I gave it 10 stars above), I will give the grade of what I thought when I first saw it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10

my friends and I are always on the lookout for chuck norris films to just bash and make fun of. One of our favorites so far is Lonewolf. i went to a wal-mart Christmas shopping and i came across this movie in the 5.99 bin. i had to get it. i had high hopes for this movie and although being absolutely hilarious at times, we agreed that bells of innocence is the worst movie we&#39;ve ever seen, made, produced, thought up, etc... who the hell would think this is a good idea. not only is it confusing at times, but the acting is just hard to watch. the man who plays oren has acting i can compare to my own vomit, and chuck took a dive on this one, he&#39;s not the greatest actor, but this was terrible. and what kind of names are oren, conrad and jux........ jux. come on people. if you honestly thought this movie was at all watchable, great for you because it was hard for me and i seriously had a headache and stomach pains after watching it. I&#39;m telling you now if you haven&#39;t seen this movie, DON&#39;T!!. For the love of god please do not subject yourself to such a horrible 90 minutes of your life.

George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn&#39;t have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis&#39; campy &#34;Old Acquaintance&#34; written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a &#34;serious&#34; writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition. Later in their lives, when Liz is a &#34;promising&#34; but blocked writer of serious fiction, Merry decides to try her hand at writing, which infuriates her pal because of Merry&#39;s casual approach to the craft she herself takes perhaps a little too seriously. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to Liz&#39;s chagrin, Merry&#39;s trashy novels hit pay dirt, and ultimately, her old friend Liz is judging her novel for the National Book Award. Bergen steals the show as the haughty writer of steamy bestsellers who schemes to bring together the broken pieces of her life in conjunction with her final literary triumph, but alas, things are never that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supporting cast includes David Selby, whom you might remember as the tragic Quentin Collins from Dark Shadows, Hart Bochner and, of course, a deliciously young and mercurial Meg Ryan in her first film role since leaving the soaps. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich and Famous is catty, campy, witty and wise. It culminates in a New Years fiasco that stresses the enduring nature of true friendship, and I never let a year go by without watching it on New Years Eve. Watch it and you&#39;ll see why.

GOLD RAIDERS (1951)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dull western/comedy feature with the Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard at this point, who I&#39;ve always enjoyed as the &#34;third Stooge&#34;) doing their usual schtick, and directed by the normally dependable Edward Bernds, who also did some of their funniest classic shorts -- so one has to wonder, just what went wrong this time? The most probable answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15-minute two-reeler comes up as too much for a 55-minute feature film. Unlike so many of their classic short subjects, GOLD RAIDERS is not worth revisiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*1/2 of ****

We bought the DVD of &#34;Walking with Dinosaurs&#34; and have been nearly ecstatic over the things that are done so very well on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many DVDs today offer the bare minimum ... the feature itself, and maybe one other language (which doesn&#39;t help the viewer at all, but makes it easier for the company to see the DVD in multiple markets). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so in the case of WWD. There are so many wonderful extras and well-thought-out vignettes that watching even the *navigation menu* is interesting. The intros to each chapter in &#34;The Making Of&#34; DVD are laugh-out-loud funny. The quality of the sound and video is terrific. And of course the story and content ... what more could a dinosaur lover ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did watch most of the version broadcast on TDC (narrated by Avery Brooks) then watched about half of the DVD (narrated by Kenneth Branaugh). As near as I can tell, the broadcast version slipped in a number of mostly American slang terms in the narration (i.e. in a section about T. Rex mating, Branugh says &#34;the female is tiring of the male&#39;s attention&#34; and Brooks says, &#34;The honeymoon is over&#34;)and cut out some of the closer-in puppet work. I prefer the Branugh version simply because it is more complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great value and wonderful production. many kudos to the BBC and the crew that made this gem.

I first saw this when it came out in the theater. Though only 13 at the time, I was an avid reader of &#34;hard science&#34; science fiction stories. The technical gaffes of the film are burned into my memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the following may have significant spoilers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even as a youngster, I knew the premise is silly. The rocket takes off for a lunar mission, in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew (though loose objects float as in zero gravity) and because of that, the &#34;cabin&#34; (the area with the controls, whatever they called it) was gyrostabalized to maintain the &#34;correct&#34; orientation (so that when they landed, why didn&#39;t they land standing on their heads?) and where, at least in near-earth space, the rocket engines had to be running continually -- with propellant combusting away without an oxidizer. When the engines quit, the rocket stopped _dead_ in space, and couldn&#39;t start going until a PhD chemist determined it needed at a little oxidizer. This time, the rocket recalled it had momentum, and the next thing our heroes know they&#39;re near Mars (even a 13-year-old nerd knew such a minimum-energy trip would take over 200 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They land, find the air was breathable (though at the time scientific data revealed that the pressure, even if the atmosphere were pure oxygen, would be too low to do any good). They decide to camp outside the ship, and even build a campfire. They come armed, even though they were supposedly going to the Moon, where firearms wouldn&#39;t be needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They get a sight of a collapsed civilization, encounter stray martians who look just like people, develop an anti nuclear war philosophy, and those who survive try to get back to the home planet, and die in the attempt by crashing on the Earth! To do that would require such a long orbital period, they&#39;d have died of starvation long before approaching their destination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film it preceded, Destination Moon, used real science most effectively (even though their &#34;rescue&#34; with the Oxygen Tank forgot about the moment arm from the tank&#39;s center of gravity to the output nozzle). This film showed woeful ignorance of even the most basic science. Only the most technologically illiterate should think of it as a science fiction film: it&#39;s on a par with the old Flash Gordon serials where their rocketships took off from their bellies and climbed in spirals, and whose engines were always on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story on this one I considered banal, and I can recommend this only as a film to be shown to students for them to pick out technical gaffes.

This movie has no plot and no focus. Yes, it&#39;s supposed to be a slap-stick, stupid comedy, but the screen-writers have no idea what the movie was about. Even the title doesn&#39;t go along with the movie. It should have been called &#34;Cool Ethan&#34; or &#34;Cheaters Never Win&#34; or something like that. The characters are not developed and no one cares what happens to them! The girl roommate character (from That 70&#39;s Show) was the only person worth watching. She was hilarious and stole every scene she was in. The others need to make sure that their own college diplomas are in the works since they&#39;ll need a career other than acting.

I ran across Yvette McClendon in a film at the Los Angeles Film Festival and thought she was a doll. After writing my review of her film there, I wanted to see more of her! Found this movie, it was pretty bad. Not her fault, she is only in the first few minutes where she is obviously being the person to pull you in to watch this bad movie. BAD directing. Scenes are looped over and over, with all the actresses. Amber Smith has a very bad breast job yet the other actresses looked pretty good. I really like Yvette but, this was obviously a bad choice of hers. I can&#39;t believe I rented this trash to look for her. I hope to find her other movies.

I just saw this early this morning on the Fox channel quite by accident (my dog woke me up) - I had seen it years ago and thought I remembered it fairly well. As a kid, I had enjoyed it. But now? As another poster commented, several of the reels were out of order, and while it was disorienting at first, and bizarre, it seemed to fit the production - what was just awful became surreal and amusing. Musical numbers for what I think was the &#34;big&#34; fundraiser show(&#34;you&#39;re in show business, I&#39;m in show business, most of the kids are in show business, let&#39;s put on a show&#34;)come out of nowhere BEFORE all the talk about putting on a show, and then fade without applause to totally unrelated &#34;straight&#34; scenes. The leading man&#39;s girlfriend shows up, spits out lines and lines of dialogue, then disappears. I was half awake, and loved every insane minute of it.

Douglas Sirk&#39;s inaugural &#34;women&#39;s-picture&#34; weepy for Universal, based on a preachy, dogmatic, didactic novel by the intolerable Lloyd C. Douglas (author of that other beloved piece of crap, *The Robe*). Rock Hudson, in the role that catapulted him to stardom, plays Bob Merrick, a drunken playboy worth untold millions who is more interested in chasing skirts and racing speedboats than in finishing his medical degree. In the first scene, he wrecks his boat on a sumptuously photographed lake. The accident nearly kills Merrick, and thus he requires a rather mysterious &#34;resuscitator machine&#34; to keep him alive . . . meanwhile, across town, beloved surgeon Dr. Phillips finally drops dead from a heart condition. Since the local hospital can maintain only one resuscitator at a time, Phillips dies so that the louse may live. When Merrick learns of this, he tries to make apologetic overtures to Phillips&#39; family, especially to the widow (Jane Wyman, coiffed and clothed in matronly hauteur), but indeed anyone and everyone who knew the surgeon spits at Merrick like a brace of cobras. One doctor on the hospital staff even calls it &#34;a total waste&#34; that the playboy lived instead of the Christ-like surgeon. Hippocrates might have had something to say about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These early scenes are where you&#39;ll find the typical Sirkian iconoclasm: the director rubs our faces so much in the unpleasantness of middle-class, mid-century America, that one finds oneself rooting for the wastrel playboy to put whoopee-cushions under the ramrod fannies of these moral hypocrites. But, alas, no: the risible plot of the novel must proceed, and Merrick soon finds himself getting converted by God, in the guise of pipe-puffing Otto Kruger, an artist who claims that Phillips made him a better man and even a better painter. (Why don&#39;t we see any of this amazing art?) We learn that the intolerably ubiquitous Dr. Phillips would often refuse payment for medical services rendered (though who exactly qualified for these &#34;magnificent exemptions&#34; is never made clear). This is supposed to provide our hero with a whole new outlook on life and an example of personal conduct. Kruger even tries to make it all sound very illicitly exciting: &#34;Once you start this thing, there&#39;s no way out of it! It&#39;s an obsession . . . a MAGNIFICENT obsession!&#34; So Merrick tries it out by AGAIN pestering the widow with apologetic overtures, but he somehow causes her to get hit by a car. She loses her eyesight. Apparently, Merrick will have several more stations-of-the-cross to trudge past before he can be accounted a decent fellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Sirk continues to sneak in his revenges even as the movie grows more and more preachy. The most obvious bit has to be the presence of Agnes Moorehead as the head hospital nurse and Wyman&#39;s friend and unrequited lesbian lover. Note the disappointment on Moorehead&#39;s face when Merrick, finally redeemed as a doctor, shows up to save Wyman&#39;s life near the end. Hudson&#39;s own homosexuality, an open secret in Hollywood at the time, is also used to great ironic effect. He and Wyman -- dowdy and fifteen years older -- generate absolutely zero erotic heat in their scenes together, which, by the way, are purposefully few, presumably because any more scenes between the stars would hopelessly expose this whole enterprise. (One thing we feel certain of: if Rock Hudson was obsessed by anything, it certainly wasn&#39;t Jane Wyman.) It&#39;s a chronic case of *Tea and Sympathy*. Sirk seemed to enjoy tweaking everyone&#39;s noses by having this gay actor -- who was attractive to the innocent ladies of the era -- coolly drift through these exquisitely-colored &#34;women&#39;s pictures&#34;. In fact, the director worked with Hudson 6 or 7 more times, to best effect in the follow-up to this film, *All That Heaven Allows*, which re-teamed Hudson with Wyman but was also accompanied by a realistic plot. In *Obsession*, meanwhile, we must endure God/Kruger gazing beneficently down from an observation-window onto Merrick and his medical team as they prepare to save Wyman&#39;s life, in tandem with a musical score of swelling vocals from a cheesy Hollywood choir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to see why Sirk is considered an auteur, check out the scene wherein Wyman explains to her grown daughter that she can in fact tell the difference from night and day. The entire frame is blackened, here: the daughter is barely visible, and Wyman&#39;s face is faintly silhouetted against a faint light. She goes on to say that she hates the night because &#34;I know that Dawn will never come again&#34;. A great, chilling moment that deserves a much better movie than *Magnificent Obsession*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars out of 10.

The Three Stooges in a feature length western comedy-musical? Perhaps &#34;Rockin&#39; in the Rockies&#34; was meant to combine the Stooges comedy short with the western musical, in a matinée; if so, this was a pleasant way to break up a Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (as Rusty) is a handsome young hero; and, Mary Beth Hughes (as the blonde June) and Gladys Blake (as the brunette Betty) are pretty women. The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group; their songs are quite tuneful; however, this is the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the film doesn&#39;t exactly &#34;rock&#34;. There are a few laughs; but the Stooges&#39; brand of humor is more subdued than usual. The talking horse is also underutilized. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** Rockin&#39; in the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes

Dire beyond belief. Obviously set on the Isle of Man masquerading as the US - very badly - and full of cut-rate British actors who can&#39;t do American accents. A monster that looks like an unarticulated promotional cut-out for Alien from a movie store, with the most inflexible feet ever seen. Girls in the shower, undressing, catfighting, blah, blah, blah. You get the idea. Don&#39;t watch it, run away, hide, AVOID.

I guess when people say this is beautifully filmed they are talking about the close ups of frogs and the cooking of meals. It certainly doesn&#39;t refer to the set which seems to be composed of about 3 rooms with no outside shots at all. Also all of it is filmed too close up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got sick of the little boy who keeps farting at Miu or pouring hot wax over ants...also do Vietnamese spend all their time sitting on their haunches? Kind of gross looking at least the way this movie depicts it--one close up of it would have been plenty not a dozen or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then finally comes part two... a chick flick for Vietnamese girls with the perfect handsome rich man who spends all day playing the piano (He is cultured). The pretty maid steals him like the forbidden green mango fruit. Deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for a few nice close ups this film is a dud. It is sort of a soap opera with out dialog. It is cloyed. How is it beautiful?? The set looks completely fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No don&#39;t make the mistake I did and rent it because someone recommended it. I was expecting beautiful shots of the coastal mountains of Vietnam or something when I heard it was a visual gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this movie. I like foreign movies even prefer them. But this movie is dumb and dull. It will leave you irritated that something like this won a bunch of prizes.

This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O&#39;Brien film (which is excellent). It borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80&#39;s original music score)combined with an affected &#34;noir&#34; feel. Dennis Quaid grins inexplicably throughout the whole film at odd moments, but he&#39;s still compelling in a general way. Meg Ryan is fine as the student helper/love interest. When the film gets sort of bad is when Dex (the prof) meets the British bodyguard/chauffeur and their duels are pretty laughable. The bodyguard works for the rich widow (played by lovely Charlotte Rampling), but those scenes are too self-consciously &#34;noir&#34; to help the film along, even though the family &#34;plot line&#34; is rather interesting. Dex also keeps showing up at the same place and finding this bodyguard, which is rather coincidental. In the latter part of the film,a man is shot by a window, and from the outside you see him jump out of it--that was pretty bad direction. But aside from some of these obvious flaws, I think it still holds OK. I certainly didn&#39;t predict the ending, so that was good--there is a twist, and although some posters here think they were misled, I thought it was a fine and believable ending. Dennis Quaid, with his weird smirks and black eyes, is more likable in The Right Stuff, Great Balls of Fire, Inner Space, and Cold Creek Manor. But here as Dex, he&#39;s supposed to be somewhat of a jerk, so he did fine. Fairly decent movie.

Don&#39;t forget the lover on the side!! She is a &#39;hottie&#39;, Karen Parsons is delicious, she is wonderful, in acting and beauty and style. It&#39;s just his Job! HO, well now here is a show that the writing slugs you in the gut and while your doubled over, kicks you in the butt! In quoting Peter&#39;s wife,(The Associate/ writer/ Producer) she said when they were watching the &#39;previews&#39; for up coming &#39;new&#39; shows at an ABC network party, she looked at her husband after the preview for &#39;the Job&#39; played and said, &#34;This doesn&#39;t look like anything else that is on this network. You guys are in trouble.&#34; Meaning, it &#39;looks&#39; very good! But it&#39;s not looking like the regular &#39;shiny happy people sitcom&#39; fare or over-hair-styled drama that they (ABC) are regularly comfortable putting on the &#39;Air&#34;. From the time I saw this, after the first episode finished, I made sure that I didn&#39;t miss that time slot next week. I was instantly addicted to &#34;The Job&#34; Cutting wit and cynicism, outrageous situations, and laughter rolling writers makes this series a Hit!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I felt anger and a feeling of being let down, that the show just sailed off the air. I wondered what executive, made that decision to tear down a major comedy cornerstone for their network?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I talked to other people about it some knowing, some not, but I know that the stupid network didn&#39;t promote this hard enough, or I should say visually enough. If they had it would have run at least 3-5 seasons, maybe even six. I just believe that knowing network short comings and being overly subscribing to one &#39;formula&#39; or another that they missed the boat with this one. There was so much room for expansion, it had barely just begun. The situations were funny and serious, fast and sometimes slow, though not much it kept a good pace. some years later, I finally found it on DVD new for $50.00. To me it would be worth $1,000.00 to have this in my entertainment library. I watched in amazement as I went through both seasons again for the third time on DVD and the ending &#39;Betrayal&#39; episode, was going into a total serious drama segment with them uncovering a murder victim, it was better than most of the drama &#39;victim Unit&#39; and &#39;cop&#39; shows on the air now!!! They went into the scenes as serious as a heart attack and as believable, did so as if not even skipping a beat. Just like it was meant to be serious, I am so impressed with the &#39;versatile ways&#39; that Tolan and Leary shared in the story-lines and scripts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In another outrage of the &#39;entertainment week&#39; I learned that the beautiful wardrobe, of silk ties and expensive suits with pressed shirts and ultra stylish footwear...was all sold to the movie made for cable &#34;In the cut&#34; (2003) for only four hundred dollars, thats it!!!! I&#39;m sick. Did you see what they all wear for each show?? A good over coat alone could run that much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was Denis Leary at some of his finest. I recommend this great cop &#39;dramedy&#39; for East-coasters or wherever you are in this country. I even heard that people from Ireland were joking with Leary the &#39;Bathroom&#39; episode, repeating lines back to him from that one, because they saw it over there. (****) A Superbly intuitive, comedic New York Leary/Tolan cop Show.

I remember seeing this film in the mid 80&#39;s thought it a well paced and well acted piece. I now work quite often in Berkeley Square and the had to get a copy of DVD to remind myself how little the area has changed, although my office is newish it just 30 seconds away from &#34;the bank&#34;. Even Jack Barclays car dealership is still there selling Bentleys and Rolls Royces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s look like the DVD is due a Region 2 release soon. The region 1 copy I is very poor quality. Let&#39;s hope they&#39;ve cleaned it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great film but I guess is in line with the caper tag the film goes with.

<p>Results</p>
<p>For HW5, I started by analyzing the output from the build_and_evaluate() function. My initial accuracy score, without making any changes to the NLTKPreprocessor, came out to be around 0.78 through mutiple attempts. It fluctuated a bit, but remained in the 0.75-0.81 range. I then looked at the reviews column to see what the data looked like and what had to be cleaned up. A lot of the work was being done with the initial code in the tokenizer, but there was HTML that was not accounted for, specifically the use of breaks (&lt;br). These breaks appear frequently in the reviews and were the first thing I addressed when trying to improve the processor. I found it easiest and most effective to strip the br occurences, since the tokenizer was already removing punctuation. I then used regular expressions to try to remove other unwanted aspects of the text, like newlines, unwanted quotes, and line breaks. Unfortunately, implementing these made the accuracy scores worse then when it just ran with removing the HTML breaks. The last part I added was removing digits from the reviews using regular expressions. This minor change gave me my best accuracy score of 0.84.</p>
<p>The other important factor that I looked at was the classifier used. The classifier giver was SGDClassifier, but it is important to try others to see if they work better in producing higher accuracy scores. As it turns out, the original classifier gave the best accuracy score every time. The next best was consistently either the GradientBoostingClassifier or the AdaBoostClassifier, which in my last attempt both gave an accuracy score of 0.77, although in some iteration gave as high as 0.82. The worst classifier SVC at 0.23. To run through multiple classifiers, I created a list of the classifiers and iterated through it with a for loop, using each one to build an accuracy score. This was time consuming but effective to be able to visualize the results side by side.</p>
<p>The final result produced an output of [0, 1, 1, 0], or negative, positive, positive, negative, when run against the yhat model.</p>
<p>At the end, I visualized the most frecuent positive words and the most frequent negative words. These are the words that most often indicated a positive or negative review. The most positive word was 'great', followed by 'excellent' and 'perfect'. The most negative word was 'bad'. This step also helped imrove my processor by showing that there was a frecuent use of number or digits in the reviews.</p>
